2 Elizabeth Blackwell, who, in 1849, became the first woman to receive a medical degree in the
3 United States; and
4 WHEREAS, Dr. Blackwell championed the participation of women in the medical field

8 wounded; and

10 ongoing contributions of all female physicians in the field of health care, including the notable

13 organ transplants; and
14 WHEREAS, Dr. Velma Scantlebury-White is no stranger to overcoming challenges. She

18 Medicine, a first in the country; and
19 WHEREAS, Dr. Velma Scantlebury-White is recognized as one of the top doctors in the
1 United States and is passionate and dedicated to educating communities of color about the need
2 for more organ donors and the rising number of patients in need of transplantation; and
3 WHEREAS, Since 1849, women physicians have made remarkable strides in health care,
4 and as of May 2024, there were 424,536 female physicians in the United States; and
5 WHEREAS, In addition, over the course of the last four years, women have made up the
6 majority of medical school applicants, matriculants, and enrollees; however, a 2021 report from
7 the Rand Corporation found that female physicians earn $2 million less than men over the course
8 of their career; and
9 WHEREAS, Women physicians bring unique perspectives to patient care, and serve as
10 leaders, educators, researchers and mentors to future generations; and
11 WHEREAS, National Women Physicians Day honors the achievements of female
12 physicians and is a time to not only recognize the contributions of female physicians to
13 healthcare, but to also inspire future generations of female physicians, and to advocate for equal
14 pay and leadership opportunities; now, therefore be it
15 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
