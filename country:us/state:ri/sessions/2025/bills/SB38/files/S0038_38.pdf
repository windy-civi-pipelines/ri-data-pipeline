3 responsibilities.

5 audits, reviews, papers, books, documents, recommendations, correspondence and any other data
6 and material relevant to any matter under audit or investigation, pursuant to the provisions of this

8 (2) A subpoena may be issued only when a person, corporation or other entity under
9 investigation or being audited refuses to voluntarily comply with a request from the inspector
10 general.
11 (3) The subpoena shall be served in the same manner as a subpoena for the production of
12 documents in civil cases issued on behalf of the State of Rhode Island, and all provisions of law
13 relative to the subpoena shall apply to a subpoena issued pursuant to this chapter. Any justice of
14 the superior court may, upon application by the inspector general, issue an order to compel the
15 production of records, reports, audits, reviews, papers, books, documents, recommendations,
16 correspondence, and any other data and material as aforesaid in the same manner and to the same
17 extent as before said superior court. Any failure to obey the order may be punished by the superior
18 court as a contempt of court.
19 (4) Any subpoena issued pursuant to this section shall not be made public by the inspector
20 general or any officer or employee of that office, nor shall any documents or records provided
21 pursuant to this section be made public until such time as it is necessary for the inspector general
22 to do so in the performance of their official duties. The production of documents or records pursuant
23 to subpoena, shall be governed by the same provisions with reference to secrecy, which govern the
24 proceedings of a grand jury. Disclosure of such production, attendance, and testimony may be made
25 to such members of the staff of the office of the inspector general as is deemed necessary in the
26 performance of the inspector general's duties and responsibilities under this chapter, and such
27 members of the staff may be present at the production of records.
28 42-9.4-9. Subpoena for witness testimony and for release of material evidence.
29 (a) Whenever the inspector general has reason to believe that a person has information or
30 evidence in their possession, with respect to any matter which is within the inspector general’s
31 jurisdiction to investigate, a subpoena may issue for the attendance and testimony, under oath, of
32 any person as designated, or the surrender of identified items of evidence; provided, however, that
33 the subpoena may be issued by the inspector general only in the performance of official duties
34 relating to the detection of fraud, waste, abuse and mismanagement. The subpoena for testimony
LC000341 - Page 6 of 11

1 or specific items identified, as needed in support of an investigation shall include: the name and
2 address of the prospective witness or specific items identified, as needed for the investigation and
3 the reasons for requesting a subpoena for testimony or production of items deemed necessary to
4 support the investigation.
5 (b) The inspector general or any other person duly authorized by law shall serve a
6 subpoena. Once the subpoena is served, the serving officer shall annotate the time and date served,
7 the person served and the location of service.
8 (c) A witness required by subpoena to attend and testify under oath and/or produce books
9 and records or other items as demanded, shall be given not less than forty-eight (48) hours notice
10 of the time and place for the taking of testimony or delivery of subpoenaed items, unless such notice
11 shall unduly interfere with the conduct of the investigation.
12 (d) The witness, at the time of service of a subpoena, shall be notified of the matter under
13 investigation concerning which the witness will be required to testify. A subject of an investigation
14 is a person whose conduct is within the scope of the investigation and is suspected of committing
15 or being party to an offense under investigation. The failure to furnish the witness with any notice
16 or information required to be given by this section, shall cause the issued subpoena to be invalid.
17 (e) A person subpoenaed to testify under oath shall appear and testify under oath at the
18 time and place designated by the subpoena. In addition, the witness shall be notified that they have
19 a right to consult with and to have an attorney present at the time the testimony is taken, and that
20 they have a constitutional right not to furnish or produce evidence that may tend to incriminate the
21 person.
22 (f) The terms of any such subpoena shall be reasonable and focused on specific testimony
23 or evidence sought and shall directly relate to the matters under investigation. A subpoena issued
24 that is broad in nature is not considered valid. No subpoena shall be issued for purposes of
25 harassment or for any illegitimate or improper purpose. All constitutional and statutory rights and
26 privileges which exist with respect to any subpoena issued by the inspector general, including the
27 privilege against self-incrimination, shall have the same force and effect with any and all existing
28 laws and constitutional rights.
29 (g) A subpoenaed person may object to the subpoena served upon them in advance of the
30 return date of the subpoena, by a motion to quash filed in the superior court of the State of Rhode
31 Island. The filing of a motion to quash shall stay all pending subpoenas until further order of the
32 superior court. Any justice of the superior court may, upon application by the inspector general,
33 issue an order to compel the attendance of witnesses subpoenaed, and the giving of testimony under
34 oath in furtherance of any audit or investigation under this chapter, in the same manner and to the
LC000341 - Page 7 of 11

1 same extent as before the superior court. Failure to obey any order of the court with respect to a
2 subpoena may be punished by the court as contempt.
3 (h) Any subpoena issued pursuant to this section, shall not be made public by the inspector
4 general or any persons subject to their direction or by any member of the inspector general's office
5 designated to hear testimony under this section, and the same provisions with reference to secrecy,
6 which govern grand jury proceedings, shall govern testimony given. Whoever violates the
7 provisions of this subsection shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than six (6) months
8 or by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000). Disclosure of such testimony may be
9 made to such members of the staff of the office of inspector general, as is deemed necessary by the
10 inspector general to assist in the performance of the office's duties and responsibilities and such
11 members of the staff may be present at the taking of such testimony.
12 42-9.4-10. Compact – Investigation.
13 (a) The inspector general shall accept and may investigate or audit complaints or
14 information from any individual concerning the possible existence of any activity constituting
15 fraud, waste, abuse and mismanagement, relating to programs and operations as set forth in § 42-
16 9.4-1.
17 (b) The inspector general shall not, after receipt of a complaint or information from an
18 employee, contractor or private citizen who requests confidentiality, disclose the identity of that
19 individual without the written consent of said individual, unless the inspector general determines
20 such disclosure is necessary and unavoidable during the course of an investigation. In such event,
21 the individual shall be notified immediately of the disclosure. The inspector general shall set up an
22 anonymous hotline for reporting possible wrongdoings.
23 (c) Employees are protected under chapter 50 of title 28, ("The Rhode Island
24 Whistleblower's Protection Act").
25 42-9.4-11. Reports to the attorney general or United States Attorney.
26 (a) In carrying out their duties and responsibilities, the inspector general shall report to the
27 attorney general, the United States Attorney or both, whenever the inspector general has reasonable
28 grounds to believe there has been a violation of federal or state criminal law. The attorney general
29 shall institute appropriate proceedings in the furtherance of completing an investigation and, if
30 warranted, refer a matter for criminal prosecution.
31 (b) The inspector general shall refer audit or investigative findings to the state ethics
32 commission, or to any other federal, state or local agency, which has an interest in said findings.
33 (c) Any referrals made under this section shall not be made public.
34 42-9.4-12. Coordination with other state agencies.
LC000341 - Page 8 of 11

1 The inspector general may coordinate with other state agencies that are responsible for
2 investigating, auditing, reviewing or evaluating the management of state agencies for the purpose
3 of sharing information and avoiding duplication of effort.
4 42-9.4-13. Civil actions.
5 The inspector general shall have the authority to institute a civil recovery action, if
6 authorized by the attorney general. In any case where the inspector general has discovered
7 fraudulent acts and believes that civil recovery proceedings may be appropriate, the matter shall be
8 referred to the attorney general. The attorney general may institute whatever proceedings deemed
9 appropriate, may refer the matter to another state or local agency, may authorize the initiation of
10 appropriate civil proceedings by the inspector general, may retain the matter for further
11 investigation, or may remand the matter to the inspector general for further investigation.
12 42-9.4-14. Annual and interim reports.
13 (a) The office of inspector general shall, no later than April 1 of each year, prepare a report
14 summarizing the activities of the office for the prior calendar year. The office may also prepare
15 interim reports. These reports shall be forwarded to the governor, lieutenant governor, attorney
16 general, secretary of state, general treasurer and the general assembly, and shall be made available
17 to the public.
18 (b) The report shall include, but not be limited to:
19 (1) A description of significant problems in the areas of fraud, waste and abuse within
20 programs and operations subject to the jurisdiction of the office;
21 (2) A description of the recommendations for corrective action made by the office during
22 the reporting period with respect to significant deficiencies in the areas of fraud, waste and abuse;

30 statement of recommendations of amendments to this chapter or the rules, regulations or procedures
31 governing the office of inspector general, which would improve the effectiveness or the operation

LC000341 - Page 9 of 11

1 shall be forwarded to the governor, the attorney general, the general assembly and the office of
2 inspector general.
3 (d) The report of the inspector general shall be made public on the day of filing; provided,
4 that the report shall not list the names of individuals or corporations, nor describe them with
5 sufficient particularity as to readily identify them to the general public in those cases in which no
6 official disposition has been made by the office of inspector general, the department of the attorney
7 general or the local office of the United States Attorney.
