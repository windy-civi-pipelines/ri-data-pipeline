7 or at a uniform percentage thereof, not to exceed one hundred percent (100%), with such value to
8 be determined by the assessors in each town or city; provided, that. There shall be no adjustment
9 to an assessment because of an increase or decrease in such value as a result of market forces in
10 years when there is no revaluation, statistical revaluation or update thereto. It is further provided
11 that:
12 (1) Any residential property encumbered by a covenant recorded in the land records in
13 favor of a governmental unit or the Rhode Island housing and mortgage finance corporation
14 restricting either or both the rents that may be charged or the incomes of the occupants shall be
15 assessed and taxed in accordance with § 44-5-13.11;
16 (2) In assessing real estate that is classified as farmland, forest, or open space land in
17 accordance with chapter 27 of this title, the assessors shall consider no factors in determining the
18 full and fair cash value of the real estate other than those that relate to that use without regard to
19 neighborhood land use of a more intensive nature;

1 (3) Warwick. The city council of the city of Warwick is authorized to provide, by
2 ordinance, that the owner of any dwelling of one to three (3) family units in the city of Warwick
3 who makes any improvements or additions on his or her principal place of residence in the amount
4 up to fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000), as may be determined by the tax assessor of the city of
5 Warwick, is exempt from reassessment of property taxes on the improvement or addition until the
6 next general citywide reevaluation of property values by the tax assessor. For the purposes of this
7 section, “residence” is defined as voting address. This exemption does not apply to any commercial
8 structure. The property owner shall supply all necessary plans to the building official for the
9 improvements or addition and shall pay all requisite building and other permitting fees as now are
10 required by law; and
11 (4) Central Falls. The city council of the city of Central Falls is authorized to provide, by
12 ordinance, that the owner of any dwelling of one to eight (8) units who makes any improvements
13 or additions to his or her residential or rental property in an amount not to exceed twenty-five
14 thousand dollars ($25,000), as determined by the tax assessor of the city of Central Falls, is exempt
15 from reassessment of property taxes on the improvement or addition until the next general citywide
16 reevaluation of property values by the tax assessor. The property owner shall supply all necessary
17 plans to the building official for the improvements or additions and shall pay all requisite building
18 and other permitting fees as are now required by law.
19 (5) Tangible property shall be assessed according to the asset classification table as defined
20 in § 44-5-12.1. Renewable energy resources shall only be taxed as tangible property under § 44-5-
21 3(c) and the real property on which they are located shall not be reclassified, revalued, or reassessed
22 due to the presence of renewable energy resources, excepting only reclassification of farmland as
23 addressed in § 44-27-10.1. Subject to the aforementioned exception for farmland, all assessments
24 of real property with renewable energy resources thereon shall revert to the last assessed value
25 immediately prior to the renewable developer’s purchasing, leasing, securing an option to purchase
26 or lease, or otherwise acquiring any interest in the real property. However, notwithstanding the
27 above, but without any limitation on taxpayer rights under § 44-5-26, no municipality shall be liable
28 or otherwise responsible for any rebates, refunds, or any other reimbursements for taxes previously
29 collected for real property with renewable energy resources thereupon.
30 (6) Provided, however, that, for taxes levied after December 31, 2015, new construction on
31 development property is exempt from the assessment of taxes under this chapter at the full and fair
32 cash value of the improvements, as long as:
33 (i) An owner of development property files an affidavit claiming the exemption with the
34 local tax assessor by December 31 each year; and
LC002682/SUB A - Page 2 of 15

1 (ii) The assessor shall then determine if the real property on which new construction is
2 located is development property. If the real property is development property, the assessor shall
3 exempt the new construction located on that development property from the collection of taxes on
4 improvements, until such time as the real property no longer qualifies as development property, as
5 defined herein.
6 For the purposes of this section, “development property” means: (A) Real property on
7 which a single-family residential dwelling or residential condominium is situated and said single-
8 family residential dwelling or residential condominium unit is not occupied, has never been
9 occupied, is not under contract, and is on the market for sale; or (B) Improvements and/or
10 rehabilitation of single-family residential dwellings or residential condominiums that the owner of
11 such development property purchased out of a foreclosure sale, auction, or from a bank, and which
12 property is not occupied. Such property described in subsection (a)(6)(ii) of this section shall
13 continue to be taxed at the assessed value at the time of purchase until such time as such property
14 is sold or occupied and no longer qualifies as development property. As to residential
15 condominiums, this exemption shall not affect taxes on the common areas and facilities as set forth
16 in § 34-36-27. In no circumstance shall such designation as development property extend beyond
17 two (2) tax years and a qualification as a development property shall only apply to property that
18 applies for, or receives, construction permits after July 1, 2015. Further, the exemptions set forth
19 in this section shall not apply to land.
20 (b) Municipalities shall make available to every land owner whose property is taxed under
21 the provisions of this section a document that may be signed before a notary public containing

25 taxation is assessed at its full and fair cash value, or at a uniform percentage of its value, not to
26 exceed one hundred percent (100%), for fiscal year 1999, by the assessors in each town and city.
27 Once the fiscal year 1999 value of the inventory has been assessed, this value shall not increase.

3 TAXPAYER INFORMATION ABOUT APPEAL PROCEDURE
4 REASONS FOR AN APPEAL. It is the intent of the general assembly to ensure that all taxpayers
5 in Rhode Island are treated equitably. Ensuring that taxpayers are treated fairly begins where
6 cities and towns meet defined standards related to performing property values. All properties
7 should be assessed in a uniform manner, and properties of equal value should be assessed the
8 same.
9 TO DISPUTE YOUR VALUATION OR ASSESSMENT OR CORRECT ANY OTHER
10 BILLING PROBLEM OR ERROR THAT CAUSED YOUR TAX BILL TO BE HIGHER THAN
11 IT SHOULD BE, YOU MUST APPEAL WITHIN NINETY (90) DAYS FROM THE DATE THE
12 FIRST TAX PAYMENT IS DUE.
13 You may appeal your assessment if your property is: (1) OVERVALUED (assessed value
14 is more than the fair market value as of December 31 in the year of the last update or revaluation
15 for real estate and as of December 31 of the tax year for personal estate for any reason, including
16 clerical and data processing errors; (2) disproportionately assessed in comparison with other
17 properties; (3) classified incorrectly as residential, commercial, industrial or open space, farm or
18 forest; (4) illegal tax partially or fully exempt; (5) modified from its condition from the time of the
19 last update or revaluation.
20 WHO MAY FILE AN APPLICATION: You may file an application if you are (1) the
21 assessed or subsequent (acquiring title after December 31) owner of the property; (2) the owner’s
22 administrator or executor; (3) a tenant or group of tenants of real estate paying rent therefrom, and
23 under obligations to pay more than one-half (½) of the taxes thereon; (4) a person owning or having
24 an interest in or possession of the property; or (5) a mortgagee if the assessed owner has not applied.
25 In some cases, you must pay all or a portion of the tax before you can file.
26 WHEN AND WHERE APPLICATION MUST BE FILED. Your application must be filed
27 with the local office of tax assessment within NINETY (90) days from the date the first tax payment
28 is due. THESE DEADLINES CANNOT BE EXTENDED OR WAIVED BY THE ASSESSOR
29 FOR ANY REASON. IF YOUR APPLICATION IS NOT FILED ON TIME, YOU LOSE ALL
30 RIGHTS TO AN ABATEMENT AND THE ASSESSOR CANNOT BY LAW GRANT YOU
31 ONE. AN APPLICATION IS FILED WHEN RECEIVED BY THE ASSESSOR’S OFFICE.
32 PAYMENT OF TAX. Filing an application does not stay the collection of your taxes. In
33 some cases, you must pay the tax when due to appeal the assessors disposition of your application.
34 Failure to pay the tax assessed when due may also subject you to interest charges and collection
LC002682/SUB A - Page 9 of 15

1 action. To avoid any loss of rights or additional charges, you should pay the tax as assessed. If an
2 abatement is granted and you have already paid the entire year’s tax as abated, you will receive a
3 refund of any overpayment.
4 FILING AN ACCOUNT. Rhode Island General Laws Section 44-5-15 requires the annual
5 filing of a true and exact account of all ratable estate owned or possessed by every person and
6 corporate body. The time to file is between December 31, and January 31, of intention to submit
7 declaration by March 15. Failure to file a true and full account, within the prescribed time,
8 eliminates the right to appeal to the superior court, subject to the exceptions provided in Rhode
9 Island General Laws Section 44-5-26(b). No amended returns will be accepted after March 15th.
10 Such notice of your intention must be sent by certified mail, postage prepaid, postmark no later
11 than 12 o’clock midnight of the last day, January 31. No extensions beyond March 15th can be
12 granted. The form for filing such account may be obtained from the city or town assessor.
13 ASSESSOR’S DISPOSITION. Upon applying for a reduction in assessment, you may be
14 asked to provide the assessor with further written information about the property and to permit
15 them to inspect it. Failure to provide the information or permit an inspection within thirty (30) days
16 of the request may result in the loss of your appeal rights.
17 APPEAL. The assessor shall have forty-five (45) days to review the appeal, render a
18 decision and notify the taxpayer of the decision. The taxpayer, if still aggrieved, may appeal the
19 decision of the tax assessor to the local tax board of review, or in the event that the assessor does
20 not render a decision, the taxpayer may appeal to the local tax board of review at the expiration of
21 the forty-five (45) day period. Appeals to the local tax board of review shall be filed not more than
22 thirty (30) days after the assessor renders a decision and notifies the taxpayer, or if the assessor
23 does not render a decision within forty-five (45) days of the filing of the appeal, not more than
24 ninety (90) days after the expiration of the forty-five (45) day period.

4 notice, file a petition in the superior court for the county in which the city or town lies for relief
5 from the assessment, to which petition the assessors of taxes of the city or town in office at the time

22 section and and/or in §§ 44-5-27 — 44-5-31, unless: (1) that person’s real estate has been assessed
23 at a value in excess of the value at which it was assessed on the last preceding assessment day,
24 whether then owned by that person or not, and has been assessed, if assessment has been made at
25 full and fair cash value, at a value in excess of its full and fair cash value, or, if assessment has

29 illegal tax, as the case may be.
30 (h) The assessor for any city or town may request and receive from the director of the
31 department of revenue one or more ninety (90) day global extensions of time (i.e. extensions which
