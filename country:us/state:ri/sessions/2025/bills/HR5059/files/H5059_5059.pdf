Date Introduced: January 15, 2025
Referred To: House read and passed
1 WHEREAS, In the altruistic words of the esteemed Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,
2 "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere." He devoted his life to the advancement of
3 civil rights and social efforts that undo the systemic effects of white supremacy, and he helped to
4 move us closer to the ideals on which America was founded, as a nation of freedom and justice
5 for all; and
6 WHEREAS, Born on January 15, 1929, Dr. King grew up in Atlanta, Georgia, attending
7 segregated public schools. After earning his high school diploma, he started college at the age of
8 fifteen and went on to obtain his doctorate in 1955; and
9 WHEREAS, During his lifetime, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., changed the course of
10 history. He led a nonviolent revolution that would forever change the social and political
11 landscape of America; and
12 WHEREAS, The mirror that the Reverend Dr. King held before the national conscience
13 revealed the ugliness of racism and hatred that divided America throughout its history, and
14 neither the carnage of civil war, nor the self-examination that Dr. King forced upon the nation,
15 has fully eradicated the injustices which are still prevalent to this day; and
16 WHEREAS, This year marks the 39th Anniversary of the first nationwide observance of
17 the Martin Luther King, Jr., federal holiday, honoring one of the most influential and iconic
18 leaders of the civil rights movement. It is a time for the people of our state and the nation to
19 recognize Dr. King's teachings by embracing and promoting his tireless, undeniable efforts

1 toward equality, and by finding ways to undo systemic economic and political injustice; now,
2 therefore be it
3 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
4 commemorates the birthday of the great Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. We honor not only
5 the man and his accomplishments, but also the continuing process of social enlightenment he
6 founded which lives with us still, ever pressing us to move beyond what we are and what we
7 think we can be. A prophet of hope, Dr. King left a legacy which will live forever; and be it
8 further
9 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
10 transmit duly certified copies of this resolution to all general office holders, members of the
11 Rhode Island Congressional Delegation, and the Martin Luther King, Jr., State Holiday
12 Commission.
