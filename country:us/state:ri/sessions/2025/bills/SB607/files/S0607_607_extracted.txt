27 this chapter, the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C. § 300f et seq., and the federal
28 regulations adopted under that act. All new and existing public water supply systems subject to the

30 regulations adopted under this chapter in order to obtain and/or maintain approval by the director
31 as a public water supply system. The director is further authorized to establish by regulation a
32 schedule of fees for applications, approvals, and renewals required by this chapter.
33 (b)(1) Any community water system serving a population of ten thousand (10,000) or more
34 shall directly deliver a full copy of the consumer confidence report, which is required by the U.S.
LC001414 - Page 29 of 31
1 Environmental Protection Agency under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C. § 300f et
2 seq., to each household within the water system’s service area that receives water from that system.

4 (i) Postal patron mailing;
5 (ii) A community newsletter that is directly delivered to each household;

8 service area that receives water from that system.
9 (2) In the event that within the service area there are buildings with five (5) or more

12 appropriate individual, noting that the reports should be distributed to residents and/or posted in a
13 common area. Additionally, colleges and universities will be exempted from this requirement but

15 (3) The department of health shall serve as the repository for all consumer confidence
16 reports and shall direct inquiries for copies of the report to the appropriate water system in order to
17 obtain a copy of the report.

14 final determination.

26 (a) The director is hereby authorized to adopt regulations consistent with the provisions of
27 this chapter, the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C. § 300f et seq., and the federal
28 regulations adopted under that act. All new and existing public water supply systems subject to the
29 provisions of this chapter must comply with the provisions of this chapter and with all the
30 regulations adopted under this chapter in order to obtain and/or maintain approval by the director
31 as a public water supply system. The director is further authorized to establish by regulation a
32 schedule of fees for applications, approvals, and renewals required by this chapter.
33 (b)(1) Any community water system serving a population of ten thousand (10,000) or more
34 shall directly deliver a full copy of the consumer confidence report, which is required by the U.S.
LC001414 - Page 29 of 31

1 Environmental Protection Agency under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C. § 300f et
2 seq., to each household within the water system’s service area that receives water from that system.
3 The method of delivery shall be determined by the water system, but can include delivery via either:
4 (i) Postal patron mailing;
5 (ii) A community newsletter that is directly delivered to each household;
6 (iii) A community calendar that is directly delivered to each household; or
7 (iv) Any other method that will directly reach each household within the water system’s
8 service area that receives water from that system.
9 (2) In the event that within the service area there are buildings with five (5) or more
10 residential units, the system will not be required to deliver directly to each of these units. Instead,
11 the water system shall mail multiple copies of the report to the building manager or other
12 appropriate individual, noting that the reports should be distributed to residents and/or posted in a
13 common area. Additionally, colleges and universities will be exempted from this requirement but
14 are still responsible for meeting all federal requirements.
15 (3) The department of health shall serve as the repository for all consumer confidence
16 reports and shall direct inquiries for copies of the report to the appropriate water system in order to
17 obtain a copy of the report.
18 SECTION 8. This act shall take effect upon passage.
