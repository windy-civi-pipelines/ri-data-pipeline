Date Introduced: March 07, 2025
Referred To: Senate Finance
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Section 45-19-1 of the General Laws in Chapter 45-19 entitled "Relief of
2 Injured and Deceased Fire Fighters and Police Officers" is hereby amended to read as follows:
3 45-19-1. Salary payment during line of duty illness or injury.
4 (a)(1) Whenever any police officer of the Rhode Island airport corporation or whenever
5 any police officer, firefighter, crash rescue crewperson, fire marshal, chief deputy fire marshal, or
6 deputy fire marshal of any city, town, fire district, or the state of Rhode Island is wholly or partially
7 incapacitated by reason of injuries received or sickness contracted in the performance of his or her
8 duties or due to their rendering of emergency assistance within the physical boundaries of the state
9 of Rhode Island at any occurrence involving the protection or rescue of human life which
10 necessitates that they respond in a professional capacity when they would normally be considered
11 by their employer to be officially off-duty, the respective city, town, fire district, state of Rhode
12 Island, or Rhode Island airport corporation by which the police officer, firefighter, crash rescue
13 crewperson, fire marshal, chief deputy fire marshal, or deputy fire marshal, is employed, shall,
14 during the period of the incapacity, pay the police officer, firefighter, crash rescue crewperson, fire
15 marshal, chief deputy fire marshal, or deputy fire marshal, the salary or wage and benefits to which
16 the police officer, firefighter, crash rescue crewperson, fire marshal, chief deputy fire marshal, or
17 deputy fire marshal, would be entitled had he or she not been incapacitated, and shall pay the
18 medical, surgical, dental, optical, or other attendance, or treatment, nurses, and hospital services,

1 medicines, crutches, and apparatus for the necessary period, except that if any city, town, fire
2 district, the state of Rhode Island, or Rhode Island airport corporation provides the police officer,
3 firefighter, crash rescue crewperson, fire marshal, chief deputy fire marshal, or deputy fire marshal,
4 with insurance coverage for the related treatment, services, or equipment, then the city, town, fire
5 district, the state of Rhode Island, or Rhode Island airport corporation is only obligated to pay the
6 difference between the maximum amount allowable under the insurance coverage and the actual
7 cost of the treatment, service, or equipment. In addition, the cities, towns, fire districts, the state of
8 Rhode Island, or Rhode Island airport corporation shall pay all similar expenses incurred by a
9 member who has been placed on a disability pension and suffers a recurrence of the injury or illness
10 that dictated his or her disability retirement, subject to the provisions of subsection (j) herein.
11 (2) A police officer or firefighter diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (as
12 described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, current edition, published
13 by the American Psychiatric Association) by an individual who holds the title of an independent
14 licensed mental health professional with a master’s degree, related to the exposure of potentially
15 traumatic events, resulting from their acting within the course of their employment or from the
16 rendering of emergency assistance in the state of Rhode Island, at any occurrence involving the
17 protection or the rescue of human life while off-duty, as set forth in subsection (h) of this section,
18 shall be presumed to have sustained an injury in the line of duty, as that term is used in subsection
19 (a)(1) of this section, unless the contrary is proven by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the
20 post-traumatic stress injury/PTSD is not related to their job as a police officer or firefighter. The
21 benefits provided for under this section shall not be extended to a police officer or firefighter, if
22 their post-traumatic stress injury/PTSD diagnosis arises out of any disciplinary action, work
23 evaluation, job transfer, layoff, demotion, termination, or similar adverse job actions.
24 (b) As used in this section, “police officer” means and includes any chief or other member
25 of the police department of any city or town regularly employed at a fixed salary or wage and any
26 deputy sheriff, member of the fugitive task force, or capitol police officer, permanent
27 environmental police officer or criminal investigator of the department of environmental
28 management, or airport police officer, probation officer or parole officer.
29 (c) As used in this section, “firefighter” means and includes any chief or other member of
30 the fire department or rescue personnel of any city, town, or fire district, and any person employed
31 as a member of the fire department of the town of North Smithfield, or fire department or district
32 in any city or town.
33 (d) As used in this section, “crash rescue crewperson” means and includes any chief or
34 other member of the emergency crash rescue section, division of airports, or department of

3 marshal” mean and include the fire marshal, chief deputy fire marshal, and deputy fire marshals
4 regularly employed by the state of Rhode Island pursuant to the provisions of chapter 28.2 of title
5 23.

8 be subject to the provisions of chapters 29 — 38 of title 28 for all case management procedures and
9 dispute resolution for all benefits.
10 (g) In order to receive the benefits provided for under this section, a police officer or
11 firefighter must prove to his or her employer that he or she had reasonable grounds to believe that
12 there was an emergency that required an immediate need for their assistance for the protection or
13 rescue of human life.
14 (h) Any claims to the benefits provided for under this section resulting from the rendering
15 of emergency assistance in the state of Rhode Island at any occurrence involving the protection or
16 rescue of human life while off-duty, shall first require those covered by this section to submit a
17 sworn declaration to their employer attesting to the date, time, place, and nature of the event

20 declarations shall also be required from any available witness to the alleged emergency involving
21 the protection or rescue of human life.

28 accidental retirement disability, for an injury occurring on or after July 1, 2011, shall apply for an
29 accidental disability retirement allowance from the state retirement board not later than the later of
