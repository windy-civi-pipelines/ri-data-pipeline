Introduced By: Senators Valverde, McKenney, Euer, DiMario, Appollonio, LaMountain,

Date Introduced: February 13, 2025
Referred To: Senate Judiciary
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Section 11-52-4.2 of the General Laws in Chapter 11-52 entitled "Computer
2 Crime" is hereby amended to read as follows:
3 11-52-4.2. Cyberstalking and cyberharassment prohibited.
4 (a) Whoever transmits any communication by computer or other electronic device to any
5 person or causes any person to be contacted for the sole purpose of harassing that person or his or
6 her family is guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be punished by a fine of not more than five hundred
7 dollars ($500), by imprisonment for not more than one year, or both. For the purpose of this section,
8 “harassing” means any knowing and willful course of conduct directed at a specific person which
9 seriously alarms, annoys, or bothers the person, and which serves no legitimate purpose. The course
10 of conduct must be of a kind that would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional
11 distress, or be in fear of bodily injury. “Course of conduct” means a pattern of conduct composed
12 of a series of acts over a period of time, evidencing a continuity of purpose. Constitutionally
13 protected activity is not included within the meaning of “course of conduct.”
14 (b) A second or subsequent conviction under subsection (a) of this section shall be deemed
15 a felony punishable by imprisonment for not more than two (2) years, by a fine of not more than
16 six thousand dollars ($6,000), or both.

1 SECTION 2. This act shall take effect upon passage.
