1 (ii) To exercise any development right, (§ 34-36.1-2.10),
2 (iii) To maintain sales offices, management offices, signs advertising the condominium,

10 (vii) Or to appoint or remove any officer of the association or any master association or
11 any executive board member during any period of declarant control, (§ 34-36.1-3.03(d)).
12 (27)(32) “Time share” means a right to occupy a unit or any of several units during five (5)
13 or more separated time periods over a period of at least five (5) years, including renewal options,
14 whether or not coupled with an estate or interest in a condominium or a specified portion thereof.
15 (28)(33) “Unit” means a physical portion of the condominium designated for separate
16 ownership or occupancy, the boundaries of which are described pursuant to § 34-36.1-2.05(a)(5).
17 (29)(34) “Unit owner” means a declarant or other person who owns a unit, or a lessee of a
18 unit in a leasehold condominium whose lease expires simultaneously with any lease, the expiration
19 or termination of which will remove the unit from the condominium, but does not include a person
20 having an interest in a unit solely as security for an obligation.
21 34-36.1-2.07. Allocation of common element interest, votes, and common expense
22 liabilities.
23 (a) The declaration shall allocate a fraction or percentage of undivided interests in the
24 common elements and in the common expenses of the association, and a portion of the votes in the
25 association, to each unit including land only units and state the formulas used to establish those
26 allocations. Those allocations may not discriminate in favor of units owned by the declarant, but
27 may discriminate in favor of units subject to a housing restriction as set forth in § 34-39.1-3. Except
28 as set forth in § 34-36.1-1.03(7), no minimum percentage interest in the common elements is
29 otherwise required.
30 (1) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, in associations where the minority, less
31 than fifty percent (50%), of the units are deed restricted units, increases in monthly common
32 expenses may not exceed five percent (5%) of the previous year’s monthly common expenses.
33 (2) In associations where the minority, less than fifty percent (50%), of the units are deed
34 restricted units and an association must impose a special assessment to cover unforeseen costs not
LC002029 - Page 5 of 11

1 included in the association’s approved annual budget for common expenses, the special assessment
2 attributed to deed-restricted units is limited to fifty percent (50%) of the full assessment. The fifty
3 percent (50%) limitation is calculated based on what the per unit share would have had the cost
4 been equally distributed across units in the association. Associations must allow owners of deed-
5 restricted units the option to enter into a monthly payment plan, at no additional charge, where the
6 payment is not in excess of one-twelfth (1/12) of the special assessment.
7 (b) If units may be added to or withdrawn from the condominium, the declaration must
8 state the formulas to be used to reallocate the allocated interests among all units included in the
9 condominium after the addition or withdrawal.
10 (c) The declaration may provide: (i) That different allocations of votes shall be made to the
11 units on particular matters specified in the declaration; (ii) For cumulative voting only for the
12 purpose of electing members of the executive board; and (iii) For the class voting on specified
13 issues affecting the class if necessary to protect valid interests of the class. A declarant may not
14 utilize cumulative or class voting for the purpose of evading any limitation imposed on declarants
15 by this chapter, nor may units constitute a class because they are owned by a declarant.
16 (d) Except for minor variations due to rounding, the sum of the undivided interests in the
17 common elements and common expense liabilities allocated at any time to all the units must each
18 equal one if stated as fractions or one hundred percent (100%) if stated as percentages. In the event
19 of discrepancy between an allocated interest and the results derived from application of the
20 pertinent formula, the allocated interest prevails.
21 (e) The common elements are not subject to partition, and any purported conveyance,
22 encumbrance, judicial sale, or other voluntary or involuntary transfer of an undivided interest in
23 the common elements made without the unit to which that interest is allocated, is void.
24 (f) Subject to the provisions of the declaration and other provisions of law, and except as
25 provided in § 34-36.1-2.12 which provides for the relocation of boundaries between adjoining units,
26 the owners of any two (2) or more units may apply for a reallocation of their respective allocated
27 interests to the executive board; but their application shall not attempt to alter common element
28 interests except as they relate to the proposed reallocation of unit interests. Unless the executive
29 board determines within thirty (30) days, that the reallocations are unreasonable, the association
30 shall prepare an amendment that identifies the units involved, states the reallocations, is executed
31 by those unit owners, contains words of conveyance between them, and upon recordation, is
32 indexed in the name of the grantor and the grantee.
33 34-36.1-3.03. Executive board members and officers.
34 (a) Except as provided in the declaration, the bylaws, subsection (b), or in other provisions
LC002029 - Page 6 of 11

1 of this chapter, the executive board may act in all instances on behalf of the association. In the
2 performance of their duties, the officers and members of the executive board are required to
3 exercise:
4 (1) If appointed by the declarant, the care required of fiduciaries of the unit owners; and
5 (2) If elected by the unit owners, ordinary and reasonable care.
6 (b) The executive board may not act on behalf of the association to amend the declaration
7 (§ 34-36.1-2.17), to terminate the condominium, or to elect members of the executive board or
8 determine the qualifications, powers and duties, or terms of office of executive board members, but
9 the executive board may fill vacancies in its membership for the unexpired portion of any term.
10 (c) Within thirty (30) days after adoption of any proposed budget for the condominium, the
11 executive board shall provide a summary of the budget to all the unit owners, and shall set a date
12 for a meeting of the unit owners to consider ratification of the budget not less than fourteen (14)
13 nor more than thirty (30) days after mailing of the summary. Unless at that meeting a majority of
14 all the unit owners or any larger vote specified in the declaration reject the budget, the budget is
15 ratified, whether or not a quorum is present. In the event the proposed budget is rejected, the
16 periodic budget last ratified by the unit owners shall be continued until such time as the unit owners
17 ratify a subsequent budget proposed by the executive board.
18 (d)(1) Subject to subsection (e), the declaration may provide for a period of declarant
19 control of the association, during which period a declarant, or persons designated by him, may
20 appoint and remove the officers and members of the executive board. Regardless of the period
21 provided in the declaration, a period of declarant control terminates no later than the earlier of:
22 (i) Sixty (60) days after conveyance of eighty percent (80%) of the units which may be
23 created to unit owners other than a declarant;
24 (ii) Two (2) years after all declarants have ceased to offer units for sale in the ordinary
25 course of business; or
26 (iii) Two (2) years after any development right to add new units was last exercised.
27 (2) A declarant may voluntarily surrender the right to appoint and remove officers and
28 members of the executive board before terminations of that period, but in that event he or she may
29 require, for the duration of the period of declarant control, that specified actions of the association
30 or executive board, as described in a recorded instrument executed by the declarant, be approved
31 by the declarant before they become effective.
32 (e) Not later than sixty (60) days after conveyance of twenty-five percent (25%) of the units
33 which may be created to unit owners other than a declarant, at least one member and not less than
34 twenty-five percent (25%) of the members of the executive board must be elected by unit owners
LC002029 - Page 7 of 11

1 other than the declarant. Not later than sixty (60) days after conveyance of fifty percent (50%) of
2 the units which may be created to unit owners other than a declarant, not less than one-third (⅓) of
3 the members of the executive board must be elected by unit owners other than the declarant.
4 (f) Not later than the termination of any period of declarant control, the unit owners shall
5 elect an executive board of at least three (3) members, at least a majority of whom must be unit
6 owners. The executive board shall elect the officers. The executive board members and officers
7 shall take office upon election.
8 (g) Notwithstanding any provision of the declaration or bylaws to the contrary, the unit
9 owners, by a two-thirds (⅔) vote of all persons present and entitled to vote at any meeting of the
10 unit owners at which a quorum is present, may remove any member of the executive board with or
11 without cause, other than a member appointed by the declarant.
12 (h) Any executive board established after June 30, 2026, containing deed-restricted units
13 within its association, shall be comprised of members proportionate with the number of deed-
14 restricted units and market-rate units. Any calculation yielding a fractional person on the board
15 shall be allocated to a market-rate owner.
16 SECTION 2. Chapter 34-36.1 of the General Laws entitled "Condominium Law" is hereby
17 amended by adding thereto the following section:
18 34-36.1-13. Allocation of common element interest, votes and common expense
19 liabilities.
