Introduced By: Representatives McEntee, Shekarchi, Blazejewski, Chippendale, Read,
Noret, Caldwell, McNamara, Kazarian, and Morales
Date Introduced: April 10, 2025
Referred To: House read and passed
1 WHEREAS, Crime and victimization in Rhode Island and the United States has
2 significant, and sometimes life-shattering, impacts on victims, survivors, and communities; and
3 WHEREAS, Delivering true justice requires that all victims are provided with the support
4 they need; and
5 WHEREAS, Barriers that prevent many survivors from receiving the services they need
6 and the justice they deserve still exist with many violent crimes, including rape and sexual
7 assault, often going unreported to law enforcement because, among other concerns, victims fear
8 placing themselves in further danger and from negative interactions with the criminal justice
9 system; and
10 WHEREAS, The inequality of victimization and surge in hate crimes faced by
11 historically marginalized groups including communities of color, Native American communities,
12 the LGBTQI+ community, the Asian American community, and the Jewish community needs to
13 be more fully addressed; and
14 WHEREAS, Victims of crime not only face physical and emotional costs, they often
15 suffer a serious economic toll as well; and
16 WHEREAS, Helping those who have experienced crime and their families is an
17 important step toward the protection of and support for victims' rights. Dedicated professionals
18 have worked to develop support and services for survivors that are more holistic, trauma-
19 informed, and effective at overcoming systemic barriers that certain communities face in
1 prosecuting offenders and obtaining justice; and
2 WHEREAS, More work remains to be done to advance these goals and National Crime
3 Victims' Rights Week provides an opportunity to raise awareness for our commitment to
4 providing survivors of crime with the support they need to heal; now, therefore be it
5 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
6 commemorates April 6th – April 12th as "National Crime Victims' Rights Week". We moreover
7 honor crime victims, survivors, and the individuals who advocate for them and renew our
8 commitment to providing survivors of crime with the support and access to services that will help
9 them cope with the physical, psychological, financial, and other adverse effects of crime; and be
10 it further
11 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
12 transmit duly certified copies of this resolution to Michelle Loranger, acting Executive Director
13 of Day One, and to the Aubin Center.
