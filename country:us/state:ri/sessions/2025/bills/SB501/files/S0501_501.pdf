12 23-28.1-6. Applicability to new or existing structures.
13 (a) All regulations contained in this code apply to all structures unless specifically
14 exempted. Prior to a building permit, other than a foundation permit, being issued, all plans for
15 buildings regulated under this code shall be submitted to the authority having jurisdiction. The
16 authority having jurisdiction shall approve or disapprove the completed set of plans within a
17 reasonable time not to exceed fifteen (15) days for fire alarm, smoke detection and/or carbon
18 monoxide detector plans. The authority having jurisdiction shall further approve or disapprove a
19 completed set of plans, covering any other project, within the specific time lines recommended by
20 the state fire marshal, and established on or before October 15, 2010 within the rules and regulations
21 of the state fire safety code board. In no case shall the authority having jurisdictional review of a
22 completed set of plans exceed ninety (90) days to complete that review without the express written
23 approval of the state fire marshal. The failure of an authority having jurisdiction to comply within
24 the timelines established pursuant to this section, may result in the issuance of a building permit.
25 The above examination of plans may be waived by the authority having jurisdiction when the plans
26 for the erection or alteration of a building are prepared by a professional engineer or architect,
27 licensed and/or registered by the State of Rhode Island, and the professional engineer or architect
28 has stated in a written, signed and stamped document, that he or she has supervised the preparation
29 of the applicable architectural, structural, electrical, mechanical, fire alarm and/or sprinkler design
30 contract documents, and that he or she will review and approve all working drawings for
31 construction, conduct on-site supervision of the construction process throughout the project, and
32 that the project shall, to the best of his or her knowledge conform to all provisions of the fire safety
33 code, and all rules and regulations, formal interpretations and blanket variances adopted under its
34 provisions. When a change of use or type of occupancy is made in an existing building, the building
LC000971 - Page 3 of 17

1 shall conform to the requirements established by the rehabilitation building and fire code for
2 existing buildings and structures, or if the rehabilitation building and fire code for existing
3 structures is not applicable, to the requirements for new structures as related to the proposed use or
4 type of occupancy.
5 (b) In existing structures, since it is not always practical or efficient to strictly apply all of
6 the provisions of the code, the authority having jurisdiction shall have the power to implement and
7 enforce the provisions of the code as provided for in the Uniform Fire Code (NFPA 1) and the Life
8 Safety Code (NFPA 101) with annexes, as applicable to existing structures, consistent with such
9 rules and regulations as may be adopted and such decisions as may be rendered by the Fire Safety
10 Code Board of Appeal and Review.
11 (c) Application of the code to new and existing structures shall be consistent with such
12 blanket variances, variances, and rules, as may be approved by the Fire Safety Code Board of
13 Appeal and Review, and such modifications as may be issued in writing by the authority having
14 jurisdiction, in accordance with NFPA 101, with annexes.
15 (d) Specific exemptions. SAVE Units as defined in § 45-24-31 and permitted pursuant to
16 § 23-27.3-111.0, whether currently available or to be provided in the future, that are allowed
17 pursuant to § 45-24-37, or on an emergency basis as set forth in § 45-24-78, are exempt from the
18 provisions of this chapter as well as related codes and regulations promulgated and enforced under
19 this chapter.

LC000971 - Page 12 of 17

1 ordinance may provide for a procedure under which a proposed land use that is not specifically

23 and has access to public sewer and water service or has access to adequate private water, such as a
24 well, and wastewater treatment system(s) approved by the relevant state agency for the entire
25 development, as applicable. The density proposed shall be determined to meet all public health and
26 safety standards.

2 code sections by right through the passage of a zoning ordinance amendment in accordance with
3 the provisions of §§ 45-24-50 through 45-24-53 and are permitted pursuant to § 23-27.3-111.0.
4 SECTION 6. Section 45-24.3-4 of the General Laws in Chapter 45-24.3 entitled "Housing
5 Maintenance and Occupancy Code" is hereby amended to read as follows:
6 45-24.3-4. Applicability.
7 (a) Every portion of a building or its premises used or intended to be used for the purpose

11 the use or occupancy of the dwelling and dwelling premises or structure, for the construction or
12 repair of the dwelling or structure, or for the installation or repair of dwelling equipment prior to

22 or occupancy, as evidenced by the date of issuance of a building permit issuance or date of issuance
23 of a certificate of occupancy.
24 (c) Except as specifically provided, the provisions of this chapter shall not apply to SAVE
25 Units as defined in § 45-24-31 that are permitted pursuant to § 45-24-37 or § 45-24-78 and which
