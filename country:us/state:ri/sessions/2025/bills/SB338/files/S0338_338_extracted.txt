IN GENERAL ASSEMBLY
JANUARY SESSION, A.D. 2025
____________
A N A C T
OF 2025
Introduced By: Senators Sosnowski, Euer, McKenney, Kallman, Murray, and Valverde
Date Introduced: February 21, 2025
Referred To: Senate Finance
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Legislative Findings. The General Assembly finds and declares that:
2 (1) In order to promote the general welfare of the people of the state, Rhode Island must
3 strengthen its economy and make it more resilient over the long term in order to avoid the economic
4 consequences of climate change, which will require initiatives that encourage the development and
5 use of innovative policies, technologies and practices;
6 (2) Rhode Island is committed to the principles of the Paris Climate Agreement and to the
7 findings of the latest climate science and acknowledges that immediate actions to reduce
8 greenhouse gas emissions, such as those set forth in this legislation, are essential to protect our
9 community, our environment, and our economy;
10 (3) The General Assembly in 2014 enacted the Resilient Rhode Island Act, which set goals
11 for reducing "greenhouse gas emissions" in Rhode Island, and established affirmative obligations
12 to meet these statutory goals;
13 (4) Climate change has a disproportionate impact on low income communities,
14 communities of color and other vulnerable residents of Rhode Island;
15 (5) Climate change increases risks to public health, including from health impacts from
16 extreme heat events, storms and floods, decreased air quality, and illnesses transmitted from food,
17 water, and disease carriers, as reported by the Rhode Island department of health;
18 (6) Climate change increases public safety risks and threats to our private property and
1 public infrastructure, including risks associated with storms, floods, and sea level rise, and these
2 risks have been recognized by several branches of the Rhode Island government as warranting
3 specific attention;
4 (7) Climate change has severe economic consequences, including catastrophic weather
5 events such as Hurricane Sandy or coastal and river flooding that cause widespread damage to
6 communities and businesses and changes to marine ecosystems that cause severe reductions in
7 winter flounder, lobster, and other marine populations, and failing to address these risks will only
8 lead to more severe and persistent impacts upon our local economy;
9 (8) Rhode Island spends over three billion dollars ($3,000,000,000) annually on fossil fuels
10 whereas carbon pricing mechanisms have been shown to be effective in creating jobs and
11 stimulating the local economy;
12 (9) Natural gas, gasoline, diesel and heating oil prices can be highly volatile and create
13 uncertainty and risk for Rhode Island's economy. Reducing energy waste and demand for fossil
14 fuels produced out-of-state can stabilize Rhode Island's economy;
15 (10) In the absence of international or federal action, states cooperating regionally are
16 effective at reducing emissions and spurring renewable energy initiatives, as demonstrated by the
17 success of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), which places a cap on emissions and
18 which has reduced overall emissions and strengthened the economies of participating states.
19 (11) Carbon pricing is a cost-effective and when used in conjunction with the emissions
20 cap set forth in RGGI, is an efficient market-based means to achieve significant carbon emissions
21 reductions;
22 (12) The clean energy sector has proven to be one of the fastest growing segments of Rhode
23 Island's economy, currently providing over fifteen thousand (15,000) jobs and growing at a rate
24 much higher than the overall state economy; increased investment will provide even more jobs in
25 addition to a higher quality of life;
26 (13) Climate change poses substantial risks to Rhode Island's ecology and natural
27 resources, and pursuant to Article 1, § 17 of the Rhode Island Constitution, it is the responsibility
28 of the state to secure the right of the people "to the use and enjoyment of the natural resources of
29 the state with due regard for the preservation of their values;" and
30 SECTION 2. Legislative intent. It is the intent of the general assembly to:
31 (1) Establish a separate restricted receipt account called the Rhode Island Economic and
32 Climate Resilience Climate Fund for creating employment and helping workers transition to low
33 carbon industries, improving energy efficiency, advancing adoption of clean energy technology,
34 establishing programs to safeguard low-income residents, and protecting businesses that are high
LC000465 - Page 2 of 12
1 energy users;
2 (2) Price carbon as an incentive to reduce carbon (greenhouse gas) emissions from use of
3 carbon-based fuels by residents and businesses in Rhode Island;
4 (3) Provide access to energy efficiency, energy conservation, and renewable energy
5 programs for low-income families and small businesses;
6 (4) Reduce public health, public safety, economic, and natural resource impairment risks
7 associated with climate change;
8 (5) Meet or exceed the state emissions goals for 2035 as set by the Resilient Rhode Island
9 Act of 2014; and
10 (6) Promote regional cooperation to reduce emissions, build renewable energy and energy
11 efficiency programs, and strengthen the economy.
12 SECTION 3. Title 23 of the General Laws entitled "HEALTH AND SAFETY" is hereby
13 amended by adding thereto the following chapter:

5 23-82.1-3. Carbon pricing.
6 (a) A fee shall be collected on all non-exempt fossil fuels within the state for purposes of
7 distribution or use within the state, at the rate specified in subsection (b) of this section, in the
8 manner specified in subsections (e) through (l) of this section.
9 (b) Commencing on the implementation date, a fee shall be charged at a rate of fifteen
10 dollars ($15.00) per metric ton of CO2e that would be released by burning the fuel sold. In each
11 subsequent fiscal year, the rate shall be the rate of the previous fiscal year plus five dollars ($5.00),
12 until it reaches a rate of fifty dollars ($50.00) per ton. After the rate reaches fifty dollars ($50.00)
13 per ton, in each subsequent fiscal year the rate will increase in accordance with inflation, as
14 measured by Rhode Island's cost-of-living-adjustments calculated using the United States Bureau
15 of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index or, if that index is not available, another index adopted
16 by the director of revenue.
17 (c) The director of revenue shall calculate and publish the rate in current dollars for each
18 year, by December 1.
19 (d) In sales where greenhouse gas emissions from the fossil fuels are to be permanently
20 sequestered and not released into the atmosphere, charges on the fossil fuels shall be reduced by
21 the director of revenue in proportion to the amount of CO2e that is to be sequestered. The office of
22 energy resources shall ensure that in such cases, the emissions are actually sequestered and not
23 released into the atmosphere.
24 (e) The fee shall be collected on all petroleum products at their first point of sale within the
25 state for consumption or distribution within the state.
26 (f) All suppliers of electricity, including all electric distribution companies operating in the
27 state and all competitive suppliers of electricity to end users, shall pay the fee on behalf of all of
28 their electricity customers on the basis of each kilowatt hour of electricity used by each distribution
29 customer. The per kilowatt hour fee to be paid by the supplier of electricity will be calculated in
30 the following manner:
31 (1) The fee shall be calculated on an annual basis, based on the electricity fuel mix as
32 defined in § 23-82.1-2.
33 (2) The CO2e of every kilowatt hour of electricity shall be determined by taking the
34 weighted average of the natural gas, coal, and oil portions of the fuel mix and multiplying each of
LC000465 - Page 5 of 12
1 those portions separately by the amount of CO2e emissions created per kilowatt hour of electricity
2 produced by each such fuel, as those carbon intensity levels are from time to time determined by
3 the United States Energy Information Administration (EIA).
4 (3) The supplier of electricity shall deduct from the fee calculated by subsections (f)(1) and
5 (f)(2) of this section an amount equal to the amount it paid for the same year on account of regional
6 greenhouse gas initiative (RGGI) clearing auctions; provided, however, that the amount so
7 deducted may be no greater than the total amount of the fee as calculated in subsections (f)(1) and
8 (f)(2) of this section. The electricity supplier shall also deduct from the fee calculated an amount
9 equal to the amount it may have paid for NE-GIS certificates as defined in § 39-26-2.
10 (g) On April 1 of each year, each supplier of electricity shall file with the commission the
11 result of its proposed calculation for the year beginning the following July 1. The filing will include
12 sufficient supporting data to enable the commission to determine whether the calculation by the
13 supplier of electricity was made fully in accordance with subsection (f) of this section. Upon receipt
14 of the calculation by the supplier of electricity, the commission shall open a docket. The sole
15 purpose of the docket shall be for the commission to determine whether the calculation by the
16 supplier of electricity was made fully in accordance with subsection (f) of this section. If the
17 commission determines that the calculation by the supplier of electricity was made fully in
18 accordance with subsection (f) of this section, the commission shall, no later than May 15 of the
19 same year, issue its order approving the calculation. If the commission determines that the
20 calculation by the supplier of electricity did not fully comply with subsection (f) of this section, the
21 commission shall issue an order stating clearly the errors that were made by the supplier of
22 electricity. In that event, the supplier of electricity shall have twenty-one (21) days to make a
23 compliance filing with the commission, correcting the errors identified in the commission's order.
24 (h) Any entity which generates more than twenty-five thousand kilowatt hours (25,000
25 kwh) of electricity for on-site use using any combination of one or more fossil fuels shall be
26 obligated to pay the carbon price, which shall be calculated by multiplying the quantity of each
27 separate fossil fuel combusted to produce electricity by the CO2e emissions of each separate fuel
28 so combusted. Within one year following the date of enactment of this chapter, the director of
29 revenue shall issue rules, pursuant to chapter 35 of title 42, for the regular and efficient calculation,
30 assessment, and collection of these carbon price amounts. Any fee already paid on said fuel
31 pursuant to this section shall be deducted from the fee that would otherwise be due under this
32 subsection.
33 (i) The local distribution company for natural gas shall pay the fee on behalf of all of its
34 distribution customers. The fee shall be calculated by multiplying the number of cubic feet of
LC000465 - Page 6 of 12
1 natural gas used by each customer by the amount of CO2e released by burning one cubic foot of
2 natural gas, as that value is from time to time determined by the United States Energy Information
3 Administration (EIA).
4 (j) The office of energy resources shall determine the amount of CO2e released in the form
5 of escaped methane due to the extraction, transport, or distribution of natural gas before the point
6 of consumption in Rhode Island, and shall add an additional charge to the carbon price for all
7 natural gas or natural-gas-based electricity, based on the rate specified in subsection (b) of this
8 section. This fee shall be published no later than December 10 of each year.
9 (k) In the event that a separate fee on the greenhouse gas content of transportation fuels is
10 established, this fee shall be deducted from the fee imposed by the economic and climate resilience
11 act; provided, however, that the amount so deducted may be no greater than the total amount of the
12 fee as calculated in subsections (f)(1) and (f)(2) of this section.
13 (l) Government agencies whose primary purpose is to provide public transportation by bus,
14 van, rail, ferry or other means that reduce the amount of driving by private motor vehicles shall be
15 exempt from the fees set forth in this section for the portion of their business that provides public
16 transport.
17 (m) The fee established by this chapter shall be reduced by the amount of any fee or
18 payment due under any federal law or under this section that sets a carbon price on the same fossil
19 fuels for the same year as described in this chapter; provided, however, that such reduction shall
20 not be in an amount of less than zero.
21 23-82.1-4. Economic and climate resilience fund.
22 (a) There is hereby established a restricted receipt account in the general fund to be known
23 as the economic and climate resilience fund. All fees collected under this chapter shall be deposited
24 in the economic and climate resilience fund.
25 (b) Unexpended balances and any earnings thereon shall not revert to the general fund but
26 shall remain solely in the economic and climate resilience fund. The economic and climate
27 resilience fund shall be used solely to carry out the provisions of this chapter.
28 (c) Proceeds from the economic and climate resilience fund may only be used for the
29 purposes described in § 23-82.1-5. Proceeds shall be available for the purposes described in § 23-
30 82.1-5 without appropriation.
31 (d) An independent economic and climate resilience fund oversight board shall be created,
32 with members chosen by the governor with the advice and consent of the senate, to include nine
33 (9) members with one member representing each of the following interests: small business, large
34 business, labor, environmental justice, scientific community, low-income, historically
LC000465 - Page 7 of 12
1 marginalized groups, community development organizations, and the transportation sector.
2 Members shall have staggered three (3) year terms. The director of the Rhode Island infrastructure
3 bank and the commissioner of the office of energy resources shall serve as permanent ex officio
4 non-voting members. The board shall elect a chair from its voting membership. The oversight board
5 shall convene quarterly to carry out roles pursuant to the provisions of subsection (d)(1) of this
6 section with the support of the office of energy resources.
7 (1) The economic and climate resilience fund oversight board and the office of energy
8 resources (OER) shall prepare and deliver an annual report to the house committee on environment
9 and natural resources, the senate committee on environment and agriculture, the house committee
10 on finance, and the senate committee on finance on or before May 1, one year after the
11 commencement of the fee, and annually on or before May 1 thereafter, which will:
12 (i) Recommend changes to the fee in order to account for greenhouse gas emissions
13 associated with the full lifecycle of all fossil fuels, including emissions prior and subsequent to
14 combustion associated with extraction, transportation, or disposal in order to help the state meet its
15 greenhouse gas reductions targets;
16 (ii) Recommend changes to the logistics of dividend distribution as currently specified in
17 §§ 23-82.1-5(b) and (c) in order to more fully account for equity in the needs of residents and
18 consumers, especially low-income residents.
19 (2) In addition to the revenue generated by § 23-82.1-3, the board may:
20 (i) Accept and administer grants from both public and private sources for the carrying out
21 of any of its functions, which loans or grants shall not be expended for other than the purposes for
22 which provided; and
23 (ii) Apply for, accept and expend allocations, grants and bequests of funds for the purpose
24 of carrying out the responsibilities of the board.
25 23-82.1-5. Economic and Climate Resilience Fund Uses.
26 (a) The Rhode Island infrastructure bank, under the auspices of the economic and climate
27 resilience fund oversight board pursuant to § 23-82.1-4, shall use the funds from the economic and
28 climate resilience fund as follows:
29 (1) Twenty-eight percent (28%) shall go to support climate resilience, renewable energy,
30 energy efficiency, climate adaptation, and low carbon transition initiatives in Rhode Island:
31 (i) At least one-third (1/3) of funding from the twenty-eight percent (28%) of the economic
32 and climate resilience fund that will be distributed to resilience and renewable energy programs
33 shall be distributed to neighborhoods, municipalities, groups of municipalities, or regional agencies
34 representing neighborhoods or municipalities whose median incomes per household are in the
LC000465 - Page 8 of 12
1 lowest third (1/3) of median incomes for all municipalities in the state.
2 (ii) For purposes of this subsection, to calculate the lowest third (1/3), the median income
3 of each municipality shall be weighted by the number of households in the municipality. When
4 possible, distribution shall prioritize assisting municipalities with existing climate action plans in
5 renewable energy and efficiency projects. A training session for municipal planners relating to
6 implementing resilience and renewable energy programs shall be a prerequisite for the
7 municipalities to receive funds.
8 (2) Thirty percent (30%) shall be used to provide direct dividends to employers in the state,
9 in the manner specified in subsections (b) and (d) of this section;
10 (3) Forty percent (40%) shall be used to provide direct dividends to residents in the state,
11 in the manner specified in subsections (b) and (c) of this section;
12 (4) Up to two percent (2%) shall be used to pay for administrative costs associated with
13 collecting the charges, administering the economic and climate resilience fund, and carrying out
14 other responsibilities assigned to the office of energy resources and department of revenue under
15 this chapter. Any unexpended revenue from this two percent (2%) shall be reallocated to climate
16 resilience and renewable energy programs, pursuant to § 23-82.1-5(a)(1). None of said proceeds
17 shall fund government operations or obligations other than to pay for reasonable administrative
18 costs in connection with the Economic and Climate Resilience Act of 2025 which should not be
19 higher than two percent (2%) of revenue collected. From the period commencing on the effective
20 date of this chapter through the implementation of the regulations necessary for the collection of
21 fees provided for under this chapter, the administrative allocation shall be the actual administrative
22 cost, and the amount of revenue directed to the climate resilience and renewable energy program
23 shall be reduced by the amount above two percent (2%) that is used for administrative costs.
24 (b) The dividends specified above shall be implemented, at the discretion of the director of
25 revenue, through a refundable credit added to tax returns for residents and employers that file tax
26 returns. For residents and employers without tax filings, dividends will be granted in the form of
27 direct checks. The director of revenue shall make every reasonable effort to ensure that every
28 resident and employer, regardless of whether or not a particular resident or employer files tax
29 returns or actually owes taxes, including not-for-profit organizations and government entities,
30 receives a dividend. Dividends will be calculated based on the estimated increased total costs of
31 energy in Rhode Island and distributed at the beginning of each year. The first set of dividends shall
32 be distributed before the implementation date based on estimated increased costs for the period of
33 January 1 through December 31 of that year, which may be subject to cost reconciliation based on
34 actual total costs by June 30 of that year.
LC000465 - Page 9 of 12
1 (c) The resident dividends shall be determined as follows:
2 (1) Fifty percent (50%) of the funds reserved for residents shall be returned in equal
3 amounts to residents in the state of Rhode Island whose incomes fall in the lowest one-third (1/3)
4 of after-tax incomes. Every resident in this one-third (1/3) shall receive an equal dividend amount.
5 Every resident in this one-third (1/3) who is a head of household with children or dependents under
6 the age of eighteen (18) shall have the dividend increased based on the number of children or
7 dependents under the age of eighteen (18) in residence, with each child adding the value of one
8 equal dividend amount.
9 (2) Thirty-five percent (35%) of the funds reserved for residents shall be returned in equal
10 amounts to residents in the state of Rhode Island whose incomes fall in the middle one-third (1/3)
11 of after-tax incomes. Every resident in this one-third (1/3) shall receive an equal dividend amount.
12 Every resident in this one-third (1/3) who is a head of household with children or dependents under
13 the age of eighteen (18) shall have the dividend increased based on the number of children or
14 dependents under the age of eighteen (18) in residence, with each child adding the value of one
15 equal dividend amount.
16 (3) Fifteen percent (15%) of the funds reserved for residents shall be returned in equal
17 amounts to residents in the state of Rhode Island whose incomes fall in the top one-third (1/3) of
18 after-tax incomes. Every resident in this one-third (1/3) shall receive an equal dividend amount.
19 Every resident in this one-third (1/3) who is a head of household with children or dependents under
20 the age of eighteen (18) shall have the dividend increased based on the number of children or
21 dependents under the age of eighteen (18) in residence, with each child adding the value of one
22 equal dividend amount.
23 (d) The employer dividends shall be determined as follows:
24 (1) Seventy percent (70%) of the funds reserved for employers shall be distributed to
25 employers in an amount proportional, in terms of full-time equivalent employees, to the employer's
26 share of total employment in the state.
27 (2) Thirty (30%) of the funds reserved for employers shall be additionally distributed to
28 employers identified by the office of energy resources as energy intensive, trade exposed, or most
29 vulnerable to fuel cost increases, which employers shall include, but not be limited to, the fishing
30 and agriculture industries.
31 (e) Residents and businesses will be given the option to opt out of receiving all or part of
32 their dividend payment to allow assistance to low-income residents so they do not experience
33 increased energy costs.
34 (f) The director of revenue shall issue a public report, submitted to the governor, the
LC000465 - Page 10 of 12
1 speaker of the house, and the senate president, by December 31 of each year commencing with
2 2026, stating the expenditures from the economic and climate resilience fund for the most recently
3 completed fiscal year and plans to distribute the balance remaining in the fund, if any.
4 23-82.1-6. Promulgation of rules.
5 The department of revenue, office of energy resources, and any other state agency or
6 instrumentality designated by this chapter or by the director of administration to perform functions
7 or duties to effectuate the purposes and functions of this chapter are hereby authorized to adopt, in
8 accordance with the provisions of chapter 35 of title 42, administer, and enforce any rules necessary
9 or convenient to carry out the purposes of this chapter.
10 23-82.1-7. Implementation.
11 The implementation of the provisions of this chapter shall commence upon initial regional
12 carbon fee enactment.
13 SECTION 4. This act shall take effect on July 1, 2026.

BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL
OF
A N A C T
RELATING TO HEALTH AND SAFETY -- ECONOMIC AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE ACT
OF 2025
***
1 This act would establish a fee on companies that sell fossil fuels in Rhode Island, paid at
2 the point of sale within the state for consumption or distribution within the state. This act would
3 also establish an "economic and climate resilience fund" to disburse the collected funds. The funds
4 would be disbursed through dividends to all residents and businesses in the state as well as allocated
5 to climate resilience, renewable energy, energy efficiency, and climate adaptation programs that
6 benefit Rhode Islanders, including low-income residents and small businesses. This act would take
7 effect upon the enactment of a fee of at least five dollars ($5.00) per metric ton of carbon by the
8 legislatures of at least three (3) states: Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and one or more additional
9 states in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI).
10 This act would take effect on July 1, 2026.

JANUARY SESSION, A.D. 2025
____________
A N A C T
RELATING TO HEALTH AND SAFETY -- ECONOMIC AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE ACT
OF 2025
Introduced By: Senators Sosnowski, Euer, McKenney, Kallman, Murray, and Valverde
Date Introduced: February 21, 2025
Referred To: Senate Finance
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Legislative Findings. The General Assembly finds and declares that:
2 (1) In order to promote the general welfare of the people of the state, Rhode Island must
3 strengthen its economy and make it more resilient over the long term in order to avoid the economic
4 consequences of climate change, which will require initiatives that encourage the development and
5 use of innovative policies, technologies and practices;
6 (2) Rhode Island is committed to the principles of the Paris Climate Agreement and to the
7 findings of the latest climate science and acknowledges that immediate actions to reduce
8 greenhouse gas emissions, such as those set forth in this legislation, are essential to protect our
9 community, our environment, and our economy;
10 (3) The General Assembly in 2014 enacted the Resilient Rhode Island Act, which set goals
11 for reducing "greenhouse gas emissions" in Rhode Island, and established affirmative obligations
12 to meet these statutory goals;
13 (4) Climate change has a disproportionate impact on low income communities,
14 communities of color and other vulnerable residents of Rhode Island;
15 (5) Climate change increases risks to public health, including from health impacts from
16 extreme heat events, storms and floods, decreased air quality, and illnesses transmitted from food,
17 water, and disease carriers, as reported by the Rhode Island department of health;
18 (6) Climate change increases public safety risks and threats to our private property and

1 public infrastructure, including risks associated with storms, floods, and sea level rise, and these
2 risks have been recognized by several branches of the Rhode Island government as warranting
3 specific attention;
4 (7) Climate change has severe economic consequences, including catastrophic weather
5 events such as Hurricane Sandy or coastal and river flooding that cause widespread damage to
6 communities and businesses and changes to marine ecosystems that cause severe reductions in
7 winter flounder, lobster, and other marine populations, and failing to address these risks will only
8 lead to more severe and persistent impacts upon our local economy;
9 (8) Rhode Island spends over three billion dollars ($3,000,000,000) annually on fossil fuels
10 whereas carbon pricing mechanisms have been shown to be effective in creating jobs and
11 stimulating the local economy;
12 (9) Natural gas, gasoline, diesel and heating oil prices can be highly volatile and create
13 uncertainty and risk for Rhode Island's economy. Reducing energy waste and demand for fossil
14 fuels produced out-of-state can stabilize Rhode Island's economy;
15 (10) In the absence of international or federal action, states cooperating regionally are
16 effective at reducing emissions and spurring renewable energy initiatives, as demonstrated by the
17 success of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), which places a cap on emissions and
18 which has reduced overall emissions and strengthened the economies of participating states.
19 (11) Carbon pricing is a cost-effective and when used in conjunction with the emissions
20 cap set forth in RGGI, is an efficient market-based means to achieve significant carbon emissions
21 reductions;
22 (12) The clean energy sector has proven to be one of the fastest growing segments of Rhode
23 Island's economy, currently providing over fifteen thousand (15,000) jobs and growing at a rate
24 much higher than the overall state economy; increased investment will provide even more jobs in
25 addition to a higher quality of life;
26 (13) Climate change poses substantial risks to Rhode Island's ecology and natural
27 resources, and pursuant to Article 1, § 17 of the Rhode Island Constitution, it is the responsibility
28 of the state to secure the right of the people "to the use and enjoyment of the natural resources of
29 the state with due regard for the preservation of their values;" and
30 SECTION 2. Legislative intent. It is the intent of the general assembly to:
31 (1) Establish a separate restricted receipt account called the Rhode Island Economic and
32 Climate Resilience Climate Fund for creating employment and helping workers transition to low
33 carbon industries, improving energy efficiency, advancing adoption of clean energy technology,
34 establishing programs to safeguard low-income residents, and protecting businesses that are high
LC000465 - Page 2 of 12

1 energy users;
2 (2) Price carbon as an incentive to reduce carbon (greenhouse gas) emissions from use of
3 carbon-based fuels by residents and businesses in Rhode Island;
4 (3) Provide access to energy efficiency, energy conservation, and renewable energy
5 programs for low-income families and small businesses;
6 (4) Reduce public health, public safety, economic, and natural resource impairment risks
7 associated with climate change;
8 (5) Meet or exceed the state emissions goals for 2035 as set by the Resilient Rhode Island
9 Act of 2014; and
10 (6) Promote regional cooperation to reduce emissions, build renewable energy and energy
11 efficiency programs, and strengthen the economy.
12 SECTION 3. Title 23 of the General Laws entitled "HEALTH AND SAFETY" is hereby
13 amended by adding thereto the following chapter:
14 CHAPTER 82.1
15 ECONOMIC AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE ACT OF 2025

5 23-82.1-3. Carbon pricing.
6 (a) A fee shall be collected on all non-exempt fossil fuels within the state for purposes of
7 distribution or use within the state, at the rate specified in subsection (b) of this section, in the
8 manner specified in subsections (e) through (l) of this section.
9 (b) Commencing on the implementation date, a fee shall be charged at a rate of fifteen
10 dollars ($15.00) per metric ton of CO2e that would be released by burning the fuel sold. In each
11 subsequent fiscal year, the rate shall be the rate of the previous fiscal year plus five dollars ($5.00),
12 until it reaches a rate of fifty dollars ($50.00) per ton. After the rate reaches fifty dollars ($50.00)
13 per ton, in each subsequent fiscal year the rate will increase in accordance with inflation, as
14 measured by Rhode Island's cost-of-living-adjustments calculated using the United States Bureau
15 of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index or, if that index is not available, another index adopted
16 by the director of revenue.
17 (c) The director of revenue shall calculate and publish the rate in current dollars for each
18 year, by December 1.
19 (d) In sales where greenhouse gas emissions from the fossil fuels are to be permanently
20 sequestered and not released into the atmosphere, charges on the fossil fuels shall be reduced by
21 the director of revenue in proportion to the amount of CO2e that is to be sequestered. The office of
22 energy resources shall ensure that in such cases, the emissions are actually sequestered and not
23 released into the atmosphere.
24 (e) The fee shall be collected on all petroleum products at their first point of sale within the
25 state for consumption or distribution within the state.
26 (f) All suppliers of electricity, including all electric distribution companies operating in the
27 state and all competitive suppliers of electricity to end users, shall pay the fee on behalf of all of
28 their electricity customers on the basis of each kilowatt hour of electricity used by each distribution
29 customer. The per kilowatt hour fee to be paid by the supplier of electricity will be calculated in
30 the following manner:
31 (1) The fee shall be calculated on an annual basis, based on the electricity fuel mix as
32 defined in § 23-82.1-2.
33 (2) The CO2e of every kilowatt hour of electricity shall be determined by taking the
34 weighted average of the natural gas, coal, and oil portions of the fuel mix and multiplying each of
LC000465 - Page 5 of 12

1 those portions separately by the amount of CO2e emissions created per kilowatt hour of electricity
2 produced by each such fuel, as those carbon intensity levels are from time to time determined by
3 the United States Energy Information Administration (EIA).
4 (3) The supplier of electricity shall deduct from the fee calculated by subsections (f)(1) and
5 (f)(2) of this section an amount equal to the amount it paid for the same year on account of regional
6 greenhouse gas initiative (RGGI) clearing auctions; provided, however, that the amount so
7 deducted may be no greater than the total amount of the fee as calculated in subsections (f)(1) and
8 (f)(2) of this section. The electricity supplier shall also deduct from the fee calculated an amount
9 equal to the amount it may have paid for NE-GIS certificates as defined in § 39-26-2.
10 (g) On April 1 of each year, each supplier of electricity shall file with the commission the
11 result of its proposed calculation for the year beginning the following July 1. The filing will include
12 sufficient supporting data to enable the commission to determine whether the calculation by the
13 supplier of electricity was made fully in accordance with subsection (f) of this section. Upon receipt
14 of the calculation by the supplier of electricity, the commission shall open a docket. The sole
15 purpose of the docket shall be for the commission to determine whether the calculation by the
16 supplier of electricity was made fully in accordance with subsection (f) of this section. If the
17 commission determines that the calculation by the supplier of electricity was made fully in
18 accordance with subsection (f) of this section, the commission shall, no later than May 15 of the
19 same year, issue its order approving the calculation. If the commission determines that the
20 calculation by the supplier of electricity did not fully comply with subsection (f) of this section, the
21 commission shall issue an order stating clearly the errors that were made by the supplier of
22 electricity. In that event, the supplier of electricity shall have twenty-one (21) days to make a
23 compliance filing with the commission, correcting the errors identified in the commission's order.
24 (h) Any entity which generates more than twenty-five thousand kilowatt hours (25,000
25 kwh) of electricity for on-site use using any combination of one or more fossil fuels shall be
26 obligated to pay the carbon price, which shall be calculated by multiplying the quantity of each
27 separate fossil fuel combusted to produce electricity by the CO2e emissions of each separate fuel
28 so combusted. Within one year following the date of enactment of this chapter, the director of
29 revenue shall issue rules, pursuant to chapter 35 of title 42, for the regular and efficient calculation,
30 assessment, and collection of these carbon price amounts. Any fee already paid on said fuel
31 pursuant to this section shall be deducted from the fee that would otherwise be due under this
32 subsection.
33 (i) The local distribution company for natural gas shall pay the fee on behalf of all of its
34 distribution customers. The fee shall be calculated by multiplying the number of cubic feet of
LC000465 - Page 6 of 12

1 natural gas used by each customer by the amount of CO2e released by burning one cubic foot of
2 natural gas, as that value is from time to time determined by the United States Energy Information
3 Administration (EIA).
4 (j) The office of energy resources shall determine the amount of CO2e released in the form
5 of escaped methane due to the extraction, transport, or distribution of natural gas before the point
6 of consumption in Rhode Island, and shall add an additional charge to the carbon price for all
7 natural gas or natural-gas-based electricity, based on the rate specified in subsection (b) of this
8 section. This fee shall be published no later than December 10 of each year.
9 (k) In the event that a separate fee on the greenhouse gas content of transportation fuels is
10 established, this fee shall be deducted from the fee imposed by the economic and climate resilience
11 act; provided, however, that the amount so deducted may be no greater than the total amount of the
12 fee as calculated in subsections (f)(1) and (f)(2) of this section.
13 (l) Government agencies whose primary purpose is to provide public transportation by bus,
14 van, rail, ferry or other means that reduce the amount of driving by private motor vehicles shall be
15 exempt from the fees set forth in this section for the portion of their business that provides public
16 transport.
17 (m) The fee established by this chapter shall be reduced by the amount of any fee or
18 payment due under any federal law or under this section that sets a carbon price on the same fossil
19 fuels for the same year as described in this chapter; provided, however, that such reduction shall
20 not be in an amount of less than zero.
21 23-82.1-4. Economic and climate resilience fund.
22 (a) There is hereby established a restricted receipt account in the general fund to be known
23 as the economic and climate resilience fund. All fees collected under this chapter shall be deposited
24 in the economic and climate resilience fund.
25 (b) Unexpended balances and any earnings thereon shall not revert to the general fund but
26 shall remain solely in the economic and climate resilience fund. The economic and climate
27 resilience fund shall be used solely to carry out the provisions of this chapter.
28 (c) Proceeds from the economic and climate resilience fund may only be used for the
29 purposes described in § 23-82.1-5. Proceeds shall be available for the purposes described in § 23-
30 82.1-5 without appropriation.
31 (d) An independent economic and climate resilience fund oversight board shall be created,
32 with members chosen by the governor with the advice and consent of the senate, to include nine
33 (9) members with one member representing each of the following interests: small business, large
34 business, labor, environmental justice, scientific community, low-income, historically
LC000465 - Page 7 of 12

1 marginalized groups, community development organizations, and the transportation sector.
2 Members shall have staggered three (3) year terms. The director of the Rhode Island infrastructure
3 bank and the commissioner of the office of energy resources shall serve as permanent ex officio
4 non-voting members. The board shall elect a chair from its voting membership. The oversight board
5 shall convene quarterly to carry out roles pursuant to the provisions of subsection (d)(1) of this
6 section with the support of the office of energy resources.
7 (1) The economic and climate resilience fund oversight board and the office of energy
8 resources (OER) shall prepare and deliver an annual report to the house committee on environment
9 and natural resources, the senate committee on environment and agriculture, the house committee
10 on finance, and the senate committee on finance on or before May 1, one year after the
11 commencement of the fee, and annually on or before May 1 thereafter, which will:
12 (i) Recommend changes to the fee in order to account for greenhouse gas emissions
13 associated with the full lifecycle of all fossil fuels, including emissions prior and subsequent to
14 combustion associated with extraction, transportation, or disposal in order to help the state meet its
15 greenhouse gas reductions targets;
16 (ii) Recommend changes to the logistics of dividend distribution as currently specified in
17 §§ 23-82.1-5(b) and (c) in order to more fully account for equity in the needs of residents and
18 consumers, especially low-income residents.
19 (2) In addition to the revenue generated by § 23-82.1-3, the board may:
20 (i) Accept and administer grants from both public and private sources for the carrying out
21 of any of its functions, which loans or grants shall not be expended for other than the purposes for
22 which provided; and
23 (ii) Apply for, accept and expend allocations, grants and bequests of funds for the purpose
24 of carrying out the responsibilities of the board.
25 23-82.1-5. Economic and Climate Resilience Fund Uses.
26 (a) The Rhode Island infrastructure bank, under the auspices of the economic and climate
27 resilience fund oversight board pursuant to § 23-82.1-4, shall use the funds from the economic and
28 climate resilience fund as follows:
29 (1) Twenty-eight percent (28%) shall go to support climate resilience, renewable energy,
30 energy efficiency, climate adaptation, and low carbon transition initiatives in Rhode Island:
31 (i) At least one-third (1/3) of funding from the twenty-eight percent (28%) of the economic
32 and climate resilience fund that will be distributed to resilience and renewable energy programs
33 shall be distributed to neighborhoods, municipalities, groups of municipalities, or regional agencies
34 representing neighborhoods or municipalities whose median incomes per household are in the
LC000465 - Page 8 of 12

1 lowest third (1/3) of median incomes for all municipalities in the state.
2 (ii) For purposes of this subsection, to calculate the lowest third (1/3), the median income
3 of each municipality shall be weighted by the number of households in the municipality. When
4 possible, distribution shall prioritize assisting municipalities with existing climate action plans in
5 renewable energy and efficiency projects. A training session for municipal planners relating to
6 implementing resilience and renewable energy programs shall be a prerequisite for the
7 municipalities to receive funds.
8 (2) Thirty percent (30%) shall be used to provide direct dividends to employers in the state,
9 in the manner specified in subsections (b) and (d) of this section;
10 (3) Forty percent (40%) shall be used to provide direct dividends to residents in the state,
11 in the manner specified in subsections (b) and (c) of this section;
12 (4) Up to two percent (2%) shall be used to pay for administrative costs associated with
13 collecting the charges, administering the economic and climate resilience fund, and carrying out
14 other responsibilities assigned to the office of energy resources and department of revenue under
15 this chapter. Any unexpended revenue from this two percent (2%) shall be reallocated to climate
16 resilience and renewable energy programs, pursuant to § 23-82.1-5(a)(1). None of said proceeds
17 shall fund government operations or obligations other than to pay for reasonable administrative
18 costs in connection with the Economic and Climate Resilience Act of 2025 which should not be
19 higher than two percent (2%) of revenue collected. From the period commencing on the effective
20 date of this chapter through the implementation of the regulations necessary for the collection of
21 fees provided for under this chapter, the administrative allocation shall be the actual administrative
22 cost, and the amount of revenue directed to the climate resilience and renewable energy program
23 shall be reduced by the amount above two percent (2%) that is used for administrative costs.
24 (b) The dividends specified above shall be implemented, at the discretion of the director of
25 revenue, through a refundable credit added to tax returns for residents and employers that file tax
26 returns. For residents and employers without tax filings, dividends will be granted in the form of
27 direct checks. The director of revenue shall make every reasonable effort to ensure that every
28 resident and employer, regardless of whether or not a particular resident or employer files tax
29 returns or actually owes taxes, including not-for-profit organizations and government entities,
30 receives a dividend. Dividends will be calculated based on the estimated increased total costs of
31 energy in Rhode Island and distributed at the beginning of each year. The first set of dividends shall
32 be distributed before the implementation date based on estimated increased costs for the period of
33 January 1 through December 31 of that year, which may be subject to cost reconciliation based on
34 actual total costs by June 30 of that year.
LC000465 - Page 9 of 12

1 (c) The resident dividends shall be determined as follows:
2 (1) Fifty percent (50%) of the funds reserved for residents shall be returned in equal
3 amounts to residents in the state of Rhode Island whose incomes fall in the lowest one-third (1/3)
4 of after-tax incomes. Every resident in this one-third (1/3) shall receive an equal dividend amount.
5 Every resident in this one-third (1/3) who is a head of household with children or dependents under
6 the age of eighteen (18) shall have the dividend increased based on the number of children or
7 dependents under the age of eighteen (18) in residence, with each child adding the value of one
8 equal dividend amount.
9 (2) Thirty-five percent (35%) of the funds reserved for residents shall be returned in equal
10 amounts to residents in the state of Rhode Island whose incomes fall in the middle one-third (1/3)
11 of after-tax incomes. Every resident in this one-third (1/3) shall receive an equal dividend amount.
12 Every resident in this one-third (1/3) who is a head of household with children or dependents under
13 the age of eighteen (18) shall have the dividend increased based on the number of children or
14 dependents under the age of eighteen (18) in residence, with each child adding the value of one
15 equal dividend amount.
16 (3) Fifteen percent (15%) of the funds reserved for residents shall be returned in equal
17 amounts to residents in the state of Rhode Island whose incomes fall in the top one-third (1/3) of
18 after-tax incomes. Every resident in this one-third (1/3) shall receive an equal dividend amount.
19 Every resident in this one-third (1/3) who is a head of household with children or dependents under
20 the age of eighteen (18) shall have the dividend increased based on the number of children or
21 dependents under the age of eighteen (18) in residence, with each child adding the value of one
22 equal dividend amount.
23 (d) The employer dividends shall be determined as follows:
24 (1) Seventy percent (70%) of the funds reserved for employers shall be distributed to
25 employers in an amount proportional, in terms of full-time equivalent employees, to the employer's
26 share of total employment in the state.
27 (2) Thirty (30%) of the funds reserved for employers shall be additionally distributed to
28 employers identified by the office of energy resources as energy intensive, trade exposed, or most
29 vulnerable to fuel cost increases, which employers shall include, but not be limited to, the fishing
30 and agriculture industries.
31 (e) Residents and businesses will be given the option to opt out of receiving all or part of
32 their dividend payment to allow assistance to low-income residents so they do not experience
33 increased energy costs.
34 (f) The director of revenue shall issue a public report, submitted to the governor, the
LC000465 - Page 10 of 12

1 speaker of the house, and the senate president, by December 31 of each year commencing with
2 2026, stating the expenditures from the economic and climate resilience fund for the most recently
3 completed fiscal year and plans to distribute the balance remaining in the fund, if any.
4 23-82.1-6. Promulgation of rules.
5 The department of revenue, office of energy resources, and any other state agency or
6 instrumentality designated by this chapter or by the director of administration to perform functions
7 or duties to effectuate the purposes and functions of this chapter are hereby authorized to adopt, in
8 accordance with the provisions of chapter 35 of title 42, administer, and enforce any rules necessary
9 or convenient to carry out the purposes of this chapter.
10 23-82.1-7. Implementation.
11 The implementation of the provisions of this chapter shall commence upon initial regional
12 carbon fee enactment.
13 SECTION 4. This act shall take effect on July 1, 2026.

1 This act would establish a fee on companies that sell fossil fuels in Rhode Island, paid at
2 the point of sale within the state for consumption or distribution within the state. This act would
3 also establish an "economic and climate resilience fund" to disburse the collected funds. The funds
4 would be disbursed through dividends to all residents and businesses in the state as well as allocated
5 to climate resilience, renewable energy, energy efficiency, and climate adaptation programs that
6 benefit Rhode Islanders, including low-income residents and small businesses. This act would take
7 effect upon the enactment of a fee of at least five dollars ($5.00) per metric ton of carbon by the
8 legislatures of at least three (3) states: Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and one or more additional
9 states in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI).
