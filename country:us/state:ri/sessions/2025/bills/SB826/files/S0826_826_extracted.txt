16 competence and qualification to provide such services shall be an additional evaluation factor in
17 the award of the contract; and
18 (C) Shall not include, as an evaluation factor in the award of the contract, the amount, if
19 any, paid by a contractor to the department for procurement using design-build-operate-maintain
20 and design-build-finance-operate-maintain;
21 (7) As provided in the request for proposals and under regulations issued by the department,

5 confidential or proprietary to determine whether such administration is subject to disclosure
6 pursuant to chapter 2 of title 38.
7 (2) The department shall take appropriate action to protect confidential or proprietary
8 information that a private entity/operator provides as part of a solicited proposal and that is exempt
9 from disclosure pursuant to chapter 2 of title 38.

16 receipt of a draft of the proposed form of contract to notify the special public-private infrastructure
17 oversight commission in writing of any material objections to the draft form of the contract. Before
