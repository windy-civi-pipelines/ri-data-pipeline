RELATING TO DOMESTIC RELATIONS -- KEEPING CHILDREN SAFE FROM FAMILY
VIOLENCE ACT
Introduced By: Senator Matthew L. LaMountain
Date Introduced: June 04, 2025
Referred To: Senate Judiciary
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Legislative findings.
2 The general assembly finds and declares that:
3 (1) Approximately fifteen million (15,000,000) children are exposed each year to domestic
4 violence or child abuse.
5 (2) Most child abuse is perpetrated in the family and by a parent.
6 (3) Intimate partner violence and child abuse overlap in the same families at rates between
7 thirty percent (30%) and sixty percent (60%).
8 (4) A child's risk of abuse increases after a perpetrator of intimate partner violence
9 separates from the perpetrator's domestic partner, even when the perpetrator had not directly abused
10 the child previously.
11 (5) Children who have witnessed intimate partner violence are approximately four (4) times
12 more likely to experience direct child maltreatment than children who have not witnessed intimate
13 partner violence.
14 (6) More than seventy-five percent (75%) of child sexual abuse is perpetrated by a family
15 member or a person known to the child. Data of the Department of Justice (DOJ) shows that family
16 members are forty-nine percent (49%), or almost half, of the perpetrators of crimes against child
17 sex assault victims younger than six (6) years of age.
18 (7) Research suggests a child's exposure to a batterer is among the strongest indicators of

1 risk of incest victimization. One study found that female children with fathers who are batterers of
2 their mothers were six and one half (6.5) times more likely to experience father-daughter incest
3 than female children who do not have abusive fathers.
4 (8) Child abuse is a major public health issue in the United States. Total lifetime financial
5 costs associated with just one year of confirmed cases of child maltreatment, including child
6 physical abuse, sexual abuse, psychological abuse, and neglect, result in one hundred twenty-four
7 billion dollars ($124,000,000,000) in annual costs to the economy of the United States.
8 (9) Empirical research indicates that allegations of child physical and sexual abuse are
9 regularly discounted by courts when raised in parental allocation cases. Courts believe that in fewer
10 than one-fourth (1/4) of claims, a parent has committed child physical or sexual abuse.
11 (10) In parental allocation cases in which an alleged or known abusive parent claims
12 alienation from the child, courts are four (4) times more likely to disbelieve the parent who claims
13 child physical or sexual abuse.
14 (11) Research shows that courts grant custody or unprotected parenting time to an alleged
15 or known abusive parent. Approximately one-third (1/3) of parents alleged to have committed child
16 abuse took primary custody from the protective parent reporting the abuse, placing children at
17 ongoing risk.
18 (12) Since 2008, nearly eight hundred (800) children have been murdered by a divorcing
19 or separating parent, with more than one hundred (100) murders occurring after a court ordered the
20 child into contact with the alleged or known abusive parent despite objections from the parent who
21 claimed child physical or sexual abuse.
22 (13) Scientifically unsound theories that treat abuse allegations of mothers as likely false
23 attempts to undermine fathers are frequently applied in family court to minimize or deny reports of
24 abuse of parents and children. Abusive parents frequently claim that abuse allegations are false to
25 minimize or deny reports of abuse. Experts who testify against abuse allegations often lack
26 expertise in the relevant type of alleged abuse, relying on unproven theories.
27 (14) Judges presiding over parental allocation cases with allegations of child abuse, child
28 sexual abuse, and domestic violence are rarely required to receive training on these subjects.
29 (15) The general assembly therefore declares that:
30 (i) A child's safety is the first priority of the court in a proceeding affecting the child's care
31 and custody;
32 (ii) Strengthening the ability of the courts to recognize and adjudicate adult and child abuse
33 allegations based on valid, admissible evidence will allow courts to enter orders that protect and
34 minimize risk of harm to the child; and
LC002997 - Page 2 of 8

1 (iii) Court personnel involved in cases containing abuse allegations who receive trauma-
2 informed training on the dynamics, signs, and impacts of child abuse, child sexual abuse, and
3 intimate partner violence will help protect and minimize risk of harm to the child.
4 SECTION 2. Title 15 of the General Laws entitled "DOMESTIC RELATIONS" is hereby
5 amended by adding thereto the following chapter:
6 CHAPTER 15.2
7 KEEPING CHILDREN SAFE FROM FAMILY VIOLENCE ACT

9 consider:

3 proof of the safety, effectiveness, and therapeutic value of the reunification treatment;
4 (4) Solely in order to improve a deficient relationship with the other parent of a child,

7 attached; or

16 relationship with the child, and a mental health professional approved by the domestic violence
17 offender management board shall verify the accused party's behavior before the court orders a
18 protective party to take steps to improve the relationship with the accused party.
