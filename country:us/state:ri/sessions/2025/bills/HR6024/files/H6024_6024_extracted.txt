Date Introduced: March 04, 2025
Referred To: House read and passed
1 WHEREAS, The Seabees are celebrating their 83rd Anniversary in 2025. The Seabees
2 were created at Davisville, Rhode Island, in 1942 by United States Navy Rear Admiral Ben
3 Morrell, Chief of the Bureau of Yards, to meet our nation's need for building and maintaining
4 overseas bases during World War II; and
5 WHEREAS, More than 350,000 Seabees served their nation during World War II as
6 members of the United States Navy construction forces. They participated in virtually every
7 United States Theater of operations, from England, Italy and France to North Africa, China,
8 Burma, and numerous islands throughout the vast Pacific. They built vital bases and airfields
9 under very difficult conditions, including being bombarded by enemy ships and planes, and were
10 killed by snipers or booby-trapped mines and bombs. They had to deal with extreme weather
11 conditions such as typhoons and extreme heat, and often had to suffer debilitating medical
12 conditions such as malaria; and
13 WHEREAS, The Seabees constructed piers, hospitals, airfields, housing, and every
14 imaginable kind of facility. They unloaded vital food and medical supplies quickly and efficiently
15 and saved lives every day during all of America's wars and conflicts. Thanks to the Seabees, the
16 United States has the ability to bring the war, if necessary, into our enemy's sphere of influence;
17 and
18 WHEREAS, The Seabees have served our nation with honor and valor during times of
19 peace and war. They answered our nation's call to duty during all of its modern conflicts, from
1 World War II and the Korean War, to Vietnam and our various engagements in the Middle East.
2 They have earned a reputation for ingenuity, innovation, courage and for having a "can do" and
3 "just get the job done" spirit that is renowned throughout the United States military and across the
4 globe; now, therefore be it
5 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
6 congratulates the Seabees on the joyous celebration of their 83rd Anniversary; and be it further
7 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
8 transmit a duly certified copy of this resolution to Rear Admiral Bradley J. Andros, Commander,
9 Navy Expeditionary Combat Command.
