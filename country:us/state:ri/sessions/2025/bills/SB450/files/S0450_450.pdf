It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Section 16-16-12 of the General Laws in Chapter 16-16 entitled "Teachers’

3 amended to read as follows:
4 16-16-12. Procedure for service retirement.
5 Retirement of a member on a service retirement allowance shall be made by the retirement
6 board as follows:
7 (a)(i) Any member may retire upon his or her written application to the retirement board
8 as of the first day of the calendar month in which the application was filed, provided the member
9 was separated from service prior to filing the application, and further provided however, that if
10 separation from service occurs during the month in which the application is filed, the effective date
11 shall be the first day following the separation from service, and provided further that the member
12 on retirement date has attained the age of sixty (60) years and has completed at least ten (10) years
13 of contributory service on or before July 1, 2005, or regardless of age has completed twenty-eight
14 (28) years of total service and has completed at least ten (10) years of contributory service on or
15 before July 1, 2005, and who retire before October 1, 2009, or are eligible to retire as of September
16 30, 2009.
17 (ii) For teachers who become eligible to retire on or after October 1, 2009, and prior to July
18 1, 2012, benefits are available to teachers who have attained the age of sixty-two (62) and
19 completed at least ten (10) years of contributory service. For teachers in service as of October 1,

1 2009, who were not eligible to retire as of September 30, 2009, but became eligible to retire prior
2 to July 1, 2012, the minimum retirement age of sixty-two (62) will be adjusted downward in
3 proportion to the amount of service the member has earned as of September 30, 2009. The
4 proportional formula shall work as follows:
5 (A) The formula shall determine the first age of retirement eligibility under the laws in
6 effect on September 30, 2009, which shall then be subtracted from the minimum retirement age of
7 sixty-two (62).
8 (B) The formula shall then take the teacher’s total service credit as of September 30, 2009,
9 as the numerator and the years of service credit determined under (A) as the denominator.
10 (C) The fraction determined in (B) shall then be multiplied by the age difference in (1) to
11 apply a reduction in years from age sixty-two (62).
12 (b)(i) Any member, who has not completed at least ten (10) years of contributory service
13 on or before July 1, 2005, may retire upon his or her written application to the retirement board as
14 of the first day of the calendar month in which the application was filed; provided, the member was
15 separated from service prior thereto; and further provided, however, that if separation from service
16 occurs during the month in which application is filed, the effective date shall be the first day
17 following that separation from service; provided, the member on his or her retirement date had
18 attained the age of fifty-nine (59) and had completed at least twenty-nine (29) years of total service;
19 or provided, that the member on his or her retirement date had attained the age of sixty-five (65)
20 and had completed at least ten (10) years of contributory service; or provided, that the member on
21 his or her retirement date had attained the age of fifty-five (55) and had completed twenty (20)
22 years of total service and provided, that the retirement allowance, as determined according to the
23 formula in § 16-16-13 is reduced actuarially for each month that the age of the member is less than
24 sixty-five (65) years and who retire before October 1, 2009, or are eligible to retire as of September
25 30, 2009.
26 (ii) For teachers who become eligible to retire on or after October 1, 2009, and prior to July

31 to July 1, 2012, who have a minimum retirement age of sixty-two (62), the retirement age will be
32 adjusted downward in proportion to the amount of service the member has earned as of September
33 30, 2009. The proportional formula shall work as follows:
34 (A) The formula shall determine the first age of retirement eligibility under the laws in
LC001400 - Page 2 of 15

1 effect on September 30, 2009, which shall then be subtracted from the minimum retirement age of
2 sixty-two (62).
3 (B) The formula shall then take the teacher’s total service credit as of September 30, 2009,
4 as the numerator and the years of service credit determined under (A) as the denominator.
5 (C) The fraction determined in (B) shall then be multiplied by the age difference
6 determined in (A) to apply a reduction in years from age sixty-two (62).
7 (c) Effective July 1, 2012, the following shall apply to all teachers not eligible to retire
8 prior to July 1, 2012:
9 (i) A teacher with contributory service on or after July 1, 2012, shall be eligible to retire

16 under this subparagraph (ii) be prior to the attainment of age fifty-nine (59) or prior to the teacher’s
17 retirement age determined under the laws in effect on June 30, 2012. The proportional formula shall
18 work as follows:
19 (1) The formula shall determine the first age of retirement eligibility under the laws in
20 effect on June 30, 2012, which shall then be subtracted from Social Security retirement age;
21 (2) The formula shall then take the teacher’s total service credit as of June 30, 2012, as the
22 numerator and the projected service at retirement age in effect on June 30, 2012, as the
23 denominator;
24 (3) The fraction determined in (2) shall then be multiplied by the age difference determined
25 in (1) to apply a reduction in years from Social Security retirement age.
26 (iii) Effective July 1, 2015, a teacher who has completed twenty (20) or more years of total
27 service and who has attained an age within five (5) years of the eligible retirement age under

5 SECTION 3. Section 45-21-16 of the General Laws in Chapter 45-21 entitled "Retirement
6 of Municipal Employees" is hereby amended to read as follows:
7 45-21-16. Retirement on service allowance.
8 Retirement of a member on a service retirement allowance shall be made by the retirement
9 board as follows:
10 (1)(i) Any member who is eligible to retire on or before June 30, 2012, may retire upon the
11 member’s written application to the retirement board as of the first day of the calendar month in
12 which the application was filed, provided the member was separated from service prior to the
13 application, and provided, further, that if separation from service occurs during the month in which
14 application is filed, the effective date is the first day following the separation from service, provided
15 that the member at the time so specified for the member’s retirement has attained the applicable
16 minimum retirement age and has completed at least ten (10) years of total service or who, regardless
17 of age, completed thirty (30) years of total service, and notwithstanding that during the period of
18 notification the member has separated from service. The minimum ages for service retirement
19 (except for employees completing thirty (30) years of service) is fifty-eight (58) years.
20 (ii) Effective July 1, 2012, the following shall apply to all members not eligible to retire
21 prior to July 1, 2012:
22 (A) A member with contributory service on or after July 1, 2012, shall be eligible to retire
23 upon the completion of at least five (5) years of contributory service and attainment of the member’s
24 Social Security retirement age.
25 (B) For members with five (5) or more years of contributory service as of June 30, 2012,
26 with contributory service on and after July 1, 2012, who have a retirement age of Social Security
27 retirement age, the retirement age will be adjusted downward in proportion to the amount of service
28 the member has earned as of June 30, 2012, but in no event shall a member’s retirement age under
29 this subparagraph (B) be prior to the attainment of age fifty-nine (59) or prior to the member’s
30 retirement age determined under the laws in effect on June 30, 2012. The proportional formula shall
31 work as follows:
32 (1) The formula shall determine the first age of retirement eligibility under the laws in
33 effect on June 30, 2012, which shall then be subtracted from Social Security retirement age;
34 (2) The formula shall then take the member’s total service credit as of June 30, 2012, as
LC001400 - Page 11 of 15

1 the numerator and the projected service at retirement age in effect on June 30, 2012, as the
2 denominator;
3 (3) The fraction determined in (2) shall then be multiplied by the age difference determined
4 in (1) to apply a reduction in years from Social Security retirement age.
5 (C) Effective July 1, 2015, a member who has completed twenty (20) or more years of total
6 service and who has attained an age within five (5) years of the eligible retirement age under

10 below in accordance with the following table:
11 Year Preceding Retirement Cumulative Annual Reduction Cumulative Monthly
12 Reduction
13 For Year 1 9% .75%
14 For Year 2 8% .667%
15 For Year 3 7% .583%
16 For Year 4 7% .583%
17 For Year 5 7% .583%
18 (D)(1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of § 42-21-16(1)(ii), a member who has
19 completed ten (10) or more years of contributory service as of June 30, 2012, may elect to retire at
20 his or her eligible retirement date as determined under paragraph (i) above provided that a member
21 making an election under this paragraph shall receive the member’s retirement benefit determined
22 and calculated based on the member’s service and average compensation as of June 30, 2012. This
23 provision shall be interpreted and administered in a manner to protect a member’s accrued benefit
24 on June 30, 2012.
25 (iii)(A) Notwithstanding any other provisions of subsection (ii) above, effective July 1,
26 2015, members in active service shall be eligible to retire upon the earlier of: (I) The attainment of
27 at least age sixty-five (65) and the completion of at least thirty (30) years of total service, or the

30 (32) years of total service, or the attainment of at least age sixty-two (62) and the completion of at
31 least thirty-three (33) years of total service; or (II) The member’s retirement eligibility date under
32 subsections (ii)(A) or (ii)(B) above.

34 section, commencing July 1, 2025, members in active service shall be eligible to retire upon the
LC001400 - Page 12 of 15

4 (II) The member's retirement eligibility date under subsections (ii)(A) or (ii)(B) of this
5 section.

7 pension benefits under this chapter unless:
8 (I) On or prior to June 30, 2012, the member has been a contributing member of the
9 employees’ retirement system for at least ten (10) years; or
10 (II) For members in active contributory service on or after July 1, 2012, the member shall
11 have been a contributing member of the employees’ retirement system for at least five (5) years.
12 (i) Provided, however, a person who has ten (10) years service credit on or before June 16,
13 1991, is vested.

18 (iv) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no more than five (5) years of service
19 credit may be purchased by a member of the System. The five (5)-year limit does not apply to any
20 purchases made prior to the effective date of this provision. A member who has purchased more
21 than five (5) years of service credit maximum, before January 1, 1995, shall be permitted to apply
22 the purchases towards the member’s service retirement. However, no further purchase will be
23 permitted. Repayment, in accordance with applicable law and regulation, of any contribution
24 previously withdrawn from the System is not deemed a purchase of service credit.
25 (v) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, effective July 1, 2012, except for purchases
26 under §§ 16-16-7.1, 36-5-3, 36-9-31, 36-10-10.4, and 45-21-53:

29 (II) For service purchases for time periods for official periods of leave as authorized by
30 law, the purchase must be made within three (3) years of the time the official leave was concluded
31 by the member.
32 Notwithstanding (I) and (II) above, service purchases from time periods prior to June 30,
33 2012, may be made on or prior to June 30, 2015.
34 (3) No member of the municipal employees’ retirement system is permitted to purchase

1 service credits for casual, temporary, emergency or seasonal employment, for employment as a
2 page in the general assembly, or for employment at any state college or university while the
3 employee is a student or graduate assistant of the college or university.
4 (4) A member does not receive service credit in this retirement system for any year or
5 portion of a year, which counts as service credit in any other retirement system in which the member
6 is vested or from which the member is receiving a pension and/or any annual payment for life. This
7 subsection does not apply to any payments received pursuant to the federal Social Security Act or
8 to payments from a military pension earned prior to participation in state or municipal employment,
9 or to military service credits earned prior to participation in state or municipal employment.
10 (5) A member who seeks to purchase or receive service credit in this retirement system has
11 the affirmative duty to disclose to the retirement board whether or not he or she is a vested member
12 in any other retirement system and/or is receiving a pension retirement allowance or any annual
13 payment for life. The retirement board has the right to investigate whether or not the member has
14 utilized the same time of service for credit in any other retirement system. The member has an
15 affirmative duty to cooperate with the retirement board including, by way of illustration and not by
16 way of limitation, the duty to furnish or have furnished to the retirement board any relevant
17 information which is protected by any privacy act.
18 (6) A member who fails to cooperate with the retirement board shall not have the time of
19 service counted toward total service credit until a time that the member cooperates with the
20 retirement board and until a time that the retirement board determines the validity of the service
21 credit.
22 (7) A member who knowingly makes a false statement to the retirement board regarding
23 service time or credit is not entitled to a retirement allowance and is entitled only to the return of
