3 hereby amended to read as follows:
4 11-49.3-2. Risk-based information security program.
5 (a) A municipal agency, state agency, or person who or that stores, collects, processes,
6 maintains, acquires, uses, owns, or licenses personal personally identifiable information about a
7 Rhode Island resident shall, at a minimum, implement and maintain a risk-based information
8 security program that meets current best practices of an approved and industry recognized
9 cybersecurity framework that contains reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to
10 the size and scope of the organization; the nature of the information; and the purpose for which the

12 unauthorized access, use, modification, destruction, or disclosure and to preserve the
13 confidentiality, integrity, and availability of such information. Controls and procedures shall be
14 implemented to restrict and manage access to the data in transit and at rest. A municipal agency,
15 state agency, or person shall not retain personal personally identifiable information for a period
16 longer than is reasonably required to provide the services requested; to meet the purpose for which
17 it was collected; or in accordance with a written retention policy or as may be required by law. A
18 municipal agency, state agency, or person shall destroy all personal personally identifiable
19 information, regardless of the medium that such information is in, in a secure manner, including,

1 but not limited to, shredding, pulverization, incineration, or erasure in accordance with current best
2 practices of an approved and industry recognized sanitization and destruction guideline.
3 (b) A municipal agency, state agency, or person who or that discloses personal personally
4 identifiable information about a Rhode Island resident to a nonaffiliated third party shall require by

6 reasonable security procedures and practices that meet current best practices of an approved and
7 industry recognized cybersecurity framework and are appropriate to the size and scope of the
8 organization; the nature of the information; and the purpose for which the information was collected
9 in order to protect the personal personally identifiable information from unauthorized access, use,
10 modification, destruction, or disclosure. The provisions of this section shall apply to contracts

23 further unauthorized disclosure.
24 (2) “Classified data” means any data that is not public (private, sensitive, confidential).
25 Classified data requires additional security controls, such as access restrictions and encryption.

32 twenty-eight (128) bit or higher algorithmic process into a form in which there is a low probability
33 of assigning meaning without use of a confidential process or key. Data shall not be considered to
34 be encrypted if it is acquired in combination with any key, security code, or password that would
LC002927 - Page 2 of 9

1 permit access to the encrypted data.
2 (5)(4) “Health insurance information” means an individual’s health insurance policy
3 number, subscriber identification number, or any unique identifier used by a health insurer to
4 identify the individual.

20 (ii) Driver’s license number, Rhode Island identification card number, or tribal
21 identification number;
22 (iii) Account number, credit or debit card number, in combination with any required

29 or trace an individual's identity, either alone or when combined with other information that is linked
30 or linkable to a specific individual. This information includes both direct and indirect identifiers,
31 as well as biometric data and internet data.
32 (10) “Reasonable security procedures” means protective, documented measures that are
33 commensurate with the risk and sensitivity of the data, suitable for the specific context, including

22 class of subject persons to be notified exceeds fifty thousand (50,000), or the municipal agency,
23 state agency, or person does not have sufficient contact information. Substitute notice shall consist
24 of all of the following:
25 (i) E-mail notice when the municipal agency, state agency, or person has an e-mail address
26 for the subject persons;

29 (iii) Notification to major statewide media.
30 11-49.3-4. Notification of breach.
31 (a)(1) Any municipal agency, state agency, or person who or that stores, owns, collects,
32 processes, maintains, acquires, uses, or licenses data that includes personal personally identifiable
33 information shall provide notification as set forth in this section of any disclosure of personal
34 personally identifiable information, or any breach of the security of the system, that poses a
LC002927 - Page 4 of 9

1 significant risk of identity theft to any resident of Rhode Island whose personal personally
2 identifiable information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized
3 person or entity.
4 (2) The notification shall be made in the most expedient time possible, subject to the
5 following:
6 (i) For state and municipal agencies, no later than thirty (30) calendar days after
7 confirmation of the breach and the ability to ascertain the information required to fulfill the notice
8 requirements contained in subsection (d), and shall be consistent with the legitimate needs of law
9 enforcement as provided in subsection (b). In the event that more than five hundred (500) Rhode
10 Island residents are to be notified, the municipal agency or state agency shall notify the attorney
11 general and the major credit reporting agencies as to the timing, content, and distribution of the
12 notices and the approximate number of affected individuals. Notification to the attorney general,
13 the division of enterprise technology strategy and services (ETSS) or successor state agency or
14 successor to the chief digital officer and the major credit reporting agencies shall be made without
15 delaying notice to affected Rhode Island residents. Where affected employees are represented by a
16 labor union through a collective bargaining agreement, the employer shall also notify the collective
17 bargaining agent, or designee, of such breaches.
18 (ii) For persons subject to subsection (a)(1), which is not a state or municipal agency, no
19 later than forty-five (45) calendar days after confirmation of the breach and the ability to ascertain
20 the information required to fulfill the notice requirements contained in subsection (d), and shall be
21 consistent with the legitimate needs of law enforcement as provided in subsection (b). In the event
22 that more than five hundred (500) Rhode Island residents are to be notified, the person shall notify
23 the attorney general and the major credit reporting agencies as to the timing, content, and
24 distribution of the notices and the approximate number of affected individuals. Notification to the
25 attorney general, the division of enterprise technology strategy and services (ETSS) or successor
26 state agency or successor to the chief digital officer and the major credit reporting agencies shall
27 be made without delaying notice to affected Rhode Island residents.
28 (b) The notification required by this section may be delayed if a federal, state, or local law
29 enforcement agency determines that the notification will impede a criminal investigation. The
30 federal, state, or local law enforcement agency must notify the municipal agency, state agency, or
31 person of the request to delay notification without unreasonable delay. If notice is delayed due to
32 such determination, then, as soon as the federal, state, or municipal law enforcement agency
33 determines and informs the municipal agency, state agency, or person that notification no longer
34 poses a risk of impeding an investigation, notice shall be provided as soon as practicable pursuant
LC002927 - Page 5 of 9

1 to subsection (a)(2). The municipal agency, state agency, or person shall cooperate with federal,
2 state, or municipal law enforcement in its investigation of any breach of security or unauthorized
3 acquisition or use, which shall include the sharing of information relevant to the incident; provided
4 however, that such disclosure shall not require the disclosure of confidential business information
5 or trade secrets.
6 (c) Any municipal agency, state agency, or person required to make notification under this
7 section and fails to do so is liable for a violation as set forth in § 11-49.3-5.
8 (d) The notification to individuals must include the following information to the extent

21 (ETSS) or successor state agency or successor to the chief digital officer; and
22 (6) A clear and concise description of the consumer’s ability to file or obtain a police report;
23 how a consumer requests a security freeze and the necessary information to be provided when
24 requesting the security freeze; and that fees may be required to be paid to the consumer reporting
25 agencies.
26 (e) For state and municipal agencies remediation services to be provided and to be
27 described pursuant to the provisions of subsection (d)(5) of this section shall include, but not be
28 limited to:
29 (1) Individuals eighteen (18) years of age and older, a minimum of five (5) years of

8 action in the name of the state against the business or person in violation.
9 (d) In addition to the penalties listed in this section, courts may impose additional
10 appropriate sanctions as warranted by the circumstances.
