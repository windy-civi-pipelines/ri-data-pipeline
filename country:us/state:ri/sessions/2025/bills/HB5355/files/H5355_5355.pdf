29 (h) The offering or developing of new institutional health services or health care equipment
30 by a health care facility without prior review by the health services council and approval by the
31 state agency shall be grounds for the imposition of licensure sanctions on the facility, including
32 denial, suspension, revocation, or curtailment or for imposition of any monetary fines that may be
33 statutorily permitted by virtue of individual health care facility licensing statutes.
34 (i) No government agency and no hospital or medical service corporation organized under
