RECOGNIZING THE CELEBRATION OF THE LUNAR NEW YEAR "THE YEAR OF THE
SNAKE" ON JANUARY 29TH OF 2025
Introduced By: Representatives Kennedy, Shekarchi, Blazejewski, Chippendale,
Kazarian, Azzinaro, Lima, Costantino, McEntee, and Shallcross Smith
Date Introduced: January 28, 2025
Referred To: House read and passed
1 WHEREAS, The most important and popular of festivals, the date of the Lunar New
2 Year celebration is fixed traditionally according to the lunar calendar as the second new moon
3 after the winter solstice; and
4 WHEREAS, Lunar New Year is celebrated by more than 20 percent of the world. This
5 year the celebration falls on January 29, 2025; and
6 WHEREAS, No one is certain how far back the New Year celebrations go in history.
7 Their religious background involves clearing away the bad luck of the old year and beginning
8 anew. It was also believed that the various god-like spirits had to report on the past year to the
9 ruler of heaven, the Jade Emperor. Many still open the celebrations by burning a paper image of
10 Tsao Wang, the hearth god, thus sending him on his way one week before the new year; and
11 WHEREAS, Usually on the day before the Lunar New Year's Eve, men pay ceremonial
12 visits to friends and associates, wishing them luck. On the last day of the year, final preparations
13 are made for the family's New Year's Eve feast, the highlight of the celebration. Before the meal,
14 all doors are sealed with strips of paper to prevent the entrance of evil, and no one may enter or
15 leave until these are removed shortly before dawn. After the meal, gifts are exchanged and, at
16 midnight, solemn greetings and family ceremonies take place; and
17 WHEREAS, Traditionally, the festivities last 16 days until the Lantern Festival, a time
18 for parades of elaborate paper lanterns and street dances by dragons or lions. New Year is also a
19 time for giving alms to the poor and for eating special lucky foods; and

1 WHEREAS, Each lunar year is popularly known by one of the 12 animals of the Chinese
2 Zodiac. These names provide a ready reference because each is used only once in 12 years. This
3 year will be celebrated as "The Year of the Snake" and signifies a time of transformation, growth,
4 and wisdom; now, therefore, be it
5 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
6 recognizes the celebration of the Lunar New Year--"The Year of the Snake." This House also
7 wishes to extend its deepest respect and appreciation to the Rhode Island Asian community for all
8 that it has contributed to the rich diversity of Rhode Island culture. The closeness of the
9 traditional Asian family, its dynamic work ethic, and its innumerable endowments to literature
10 and the performing arts inspire us all; and be it further
11 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
12 transmit a duly certified copy of this resolution to the Rhode Island Association of Chinese
13 Americans.
