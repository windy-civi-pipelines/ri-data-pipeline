MONTH" IN THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND
Introduced By: Senators Murray, Mack, Bell, DiPalma, Britto, Appollonio, Urso,
Vargas, Sosnowski, and Rogers
Date Introduced: June 05, 2025
Referred To: Recommended for Immediate Consideration
1 WHEREAS, Annually, June is the month chosen to celebrate "Pride", a time for the
2 Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex and Asexual (LGBTQIA+) communities
3 and all Americans to reflect on the struggles and injustices endured by LGBTQIA+ communities.
4 It is a month to take pride in the progress that has been made since the fateful Stonewall Riots in
5 1969, in Greenwich Village, New York, which were in response to rampant discrimination by the
6 police and a legal system that was hostile to the LGBTQIA+ community; and
7 WHEREAS, LGBTQIA+ people still experience harassment and discrimination based on
8 their sexual orientation and gender identity locally, nationally and internationally. LGBTQIA+
9 people of color and particularly, trans women of color face greater disparities in the areas of
10 health, housing, and criminal justice and are many more times likely to be the victims of fatal
11 violence; and
12 WHEREAS, Although much progress has been made including, but not limited to,
13 gaining civil rights protections in Rhode Island in 1995 and 2001, winning the right to marry in
14 Rhode Island in 2013, and nationally in 2015, more progress needs to be made; and
15 WHEREAS, "Pride" is a time to celebrate the right to live authentically and to be proud
16 of "who you are" instead of ashamed by a social stigma that was, and unfortunately still is, a
17 reality in our society; and
18 WHEREAS, In order to form a more perfect union, America was founded on the
19 principles of equality and "liberty and justice" for all, but for too long, since our Nation's
1 founding, LGBTQIA+ and many other Americans have been denied those precious rights and
2 freedoms that were supposed to be granted to all; and
3 WHEREAS, This year’s celebrations include the 49th Rhode Island PrideFest &
4 Illuminated Night Parade on June 21st, featuring all-day entertainment from a variety of local,
5 regional and national acts, food vendors, and booths highlighting numerous business and
6 nonprofit organizations; and
7 WHEREAS, The LGBTQIA+ communities and people from across the State will be
8 celebrating notions of love, equality, understanding, respect, acceptance, and justice, and the
9 belief that love is love and that trans rights are human rights, and expressing solidarity in the
10 continued fight for social justice against all intersecting forms of oppression; now, therefore be it
11 RESOLVED, That this Senate of the State of Rhode Island hereby joyously celebrates
12 and commemorates June of 2025, as "Pride Month" in the State of Rhode Island; and be it further
13 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
14 transmit duly certified copies of this resolution to the Honorable Donald Trump, President of the
15 United States, the Honorable Daniel McKee, Governor of the State of Rhode Island, the Rhode
16 Island Congressional Delegation, the LGBTQ Action Network, TGI Network of Rhode Island,
