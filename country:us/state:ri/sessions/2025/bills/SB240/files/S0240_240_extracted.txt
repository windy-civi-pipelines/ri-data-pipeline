IN GENERAL ASSEMBLY
JANUARY SESSION, A.D. 2025
____________
A N A C T
Introduced By: Senators Vargas, Mack, DiMario, Murray, DiPalma, Lawson, Gallo,
Urso, and Bissaillon
Date Introduced: February 13, 2025
Referred To: Senate Education
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Legislative findings.
2 The general assembly finds that:
3 (1) Access to affordable, high-quality childcare is essential to support labor force
4 participation of parents with children from infancy through age twelve (12) years and to maximize
5 the economic productivity of the state.
6 (2) Access to affordable, high-quality childcare is essential for all parents to achieve
7 economic security and independence, particularly for mothers who often have lower lifetime
8 earnings because they earn lower wages, work reduced hours, and take longer breaks from work in
9 order to care for children.
10 (3) High-quality childcare programs, staffed by qualified and effective educators, are
11 essential for children to promote healthy development and optimize learning during early childhood
12 and school-age years.
13 (4) A landmark report by the Institute of Medicine and National Research Council found
14 that children begin learning at birth and the adults that provide for the care and education of children
15 bear a great responsibility for their health, development, and learning -- setting the critical
16 foundation for lifelong progress. The report recommends that states work to increase the
17 qualifications and compensation of childcare educators, including those who care for infants and
18 toddlers.
19 (5) Childcare educators are among the lowest paid workers in Rhode Island. In 2023, the
1 median wage of a childcare educator in Rhode Island was sixteen dollars and ninety-one cents
2 ($16.91) per hour.
3 (6) The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services provides significant funding to
4 Rhode Island through the Child Care and Development Block Grant and has established clear
5 guidelines for setting rates that provide low-income families with "equal access" to the childcare
6 market as required under federal law. The "equal access" guideline is to pay rates equal to or above
7 the seventy-fifth percentile of a recent market rate survey.
8 (7) The Rhode Island Governor’s Workforce Board recommends that Rhode Island pay
9 child care rates that meet or exceed the equal access standard as a first step to support program
10 quality and to improved wages and retention of child care educators. As of 2024, there were
11 seventeen (17) states that met or exceeded the equal access standard, including New York and
12 Vermont. Rhode Island’s base rate for infant care in a licensed child care center was at the 5th
13 percentile of the 2024 market rate survey, well below the 75th percentile equal access standard.
14 (8) The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has also established a clear
15 guideline for determining whether childcare is affordable. Currently, the federal guideline for
16 affordability is that families should pay no more than seven percent (7%) of family income for
17 childcare. Using that guideline, almost all families with young children in the State of Rhode Island
18 need a subsidy to afford the cost of high-quality childcare staffed by qualified, effective, and fairly-
19 compensated educators.
20 (9) The Federal Child Care and Development Block Grant focuses on helping lower income
21 families access child care, limiting the use of federal funds to families with incomes at or below
22 eighty-five percent (85%) of the state median income ($106,529) for a family of four in Rhode
23 Island in Federal Fiscal Year 2025), and allows states to waive this limit for children who are
24 members of a protected population such as children in foster care. As of 2024, there were sixteen
25 (16) states that set family income eligibility limits at or above eight-five percent (85%) of state
26 median income, including Maine, New Hampshire, New York and Vermont.
27 SECTION 2. Title 40 of the General Laws entitled "HUMAN SERVICES" is hereby
28 amended by adding thereto the following chapter:
29 CHAPTER 6.7

LC000920 - Page 2 of 13
1 (b) Low-income childcare. The department shall provide childcare to all other families with
2 incomes at or below eighty-five percent (85%) of the state median income, the low-income family
3 eligibility benchmark in the federal Childcare and Development Block Grant if, and to the extent,
4 these other families require childcare in order to work at paid employment and/or to participate in
5 training, apprenticeship, internship, on-the-job training, work experience, work immersion, or other
6 job-readiness/job- attachment programs sponsored or funded by the human resource investment
7 council (governor's workforce board) or state agencies that are part of the coordinated program
8 system pursuant to § 42-102-11. The department shall also provide childcare assistance to families

15 in the administrative rulemaking process by the department. As used in this section "liquid
16 resources" means any interest(s) in property in the form of cash or other financial instruments or
17 accounts that are readily convertible to cash or cash equivalents. These resources include, but are

24 (d) The parent or caretaker relative of any family applying for childcare assistance may
25 voluntarily access the state’s office of child support services for assistance in locating the non-
26 custodial parent, establishing parentage, establishing a child support and/or medical order, and
27 enforcement of the order, but this shall not be a requirement to qualify for or access childcare
28 assistance.
29 (e) For purposes of this section, "appropriate childcare" means childcare, including infant,
30 toddler, preschool, nursery school, and school age, that is provided by a person or organization
31 qualified, approved, and authorized to provide the care by the state agency or agencies designated
32 to make the determinations in accordance with the provisions set forth in this section.

4 as defined in subsection (h) of this section.
5 (2) Families who are receiving childcare assistance and who become ineligible for
6 childcare assistance as a result of their incomes exceeding eighty-five percent (85%) of state
7 median income shall continue to be eligible for childcare assistance until their incomes exceeds
8 one hundred percent (100%) of the state median income. To be eligible, the families must continue
9 to pay for some portion of the childcare they receive, as indicated in a sliding-fee scale adopted in
10 the department's rules, not to exceed seven percent (7%) of income as defined in subsection (h) of
11 this section, and in accordance with other eligibility standards.
12 (g) In determining the type of childcare to be provided to a family, the department shall
13 take into account the cost of available childcare options, the suitability of the type of care available
14 for the child; and the parent's preference as to the type of childcare.
15 (h) For purposes of this section, “income” for families receiving cash assistance under §§
16 40-5.2-10(g)(2) and 40-5.2-10(g)(3), and income for other families shall mean gross, earned, and
17 unearned income as determined by departmental regulations.
18 (i) The caseload estimating conference established by chapter 17 of title 35 shall forecast
19 the expenditures for childcare in accordance with the provisions of § 35-17-1.
20 (j) In determining eligibility for childcare assistance for children of members of reserve
21 components called to active duty during a time of conflict, the department shall freeze the family

OF
A N A C T
RELATING TO HUMAN SERVICES -- RHODE ISLAND CHILDCARE IS ESSENTIAL ACT
***
1 This act would create the Rhode Island Childcare Assistance Program that governs both
2 family eligibility for the state’s childcare subsidy program and the rates paid to childcare providers
3 serving families receiving a subsidy. The act would expand eligibility for the program to meet the
4 federal eligibility benchmark so that families with incomes at or below eighty-five percent (85%)
5 of the state median income would be eligible. The act would allow families to continue eligibility
6 until their income exceeds one hundred percent (100%) of the state median income and would make
7 participation in the state’s child support enforcement program voluntary for the childcare subsidy.
8 The act would also increase the tiered rates of paid for licensed childcare centers to meet or exceed
9 the federal equal access benchmark, implement a new differential bonus rate for infants under age
10 eighteen (18) months and adopt fair payment practices consistent with the federal rules for the Child
11 Care and Development Fund.
12 This act would take effect on July 1, 2025.

IN GENERAL ASSEMBLY
JANUARY SESSION, A.D. 2025
____________
A N A C T
RELATING TO HUMAN SERVICES -- RHODE ISLAND CHILDCARE IS ESSENTIAL ACT
Introduced By: Senators Vargas, Mack, DiMario, Murray, DiPalma, Lawson, Gallo,
Urso, and Bissaillon
Date Introduced: February 13, 2025
Referred To: Senate Education
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Legislative findings.
2 The general assembly finds that:
3 (1) Access to affordable, high-quality childcare is essential to support labor force
4 participation of parents with children from infancy through age twelve (12) years and to maximize
5 the economic productivity of the state.
6 (2) Access to affordable, high-quality childcare is essential for all parents to achieve
7 economic security and independence, particularly for mothers who often have lower lifetime
8 earnings because they earn lower wages, work reduced hours, and take longer breaks from work in
9 order to care for children.
10 (3) High-quality childcare programs, staffed by qualified and effective educators, are
11 essential for children to promote healthy development and optimize learning during early childhood
12 and school-age years.
13 (4) A landmark report by the Institute of Medicine and National Research Council found
14 that children begin learning at birth and the adults that provide for the care and education of children
15 bear a great responsibility for their health, development, and learning -- setting the critical
16 foundation for lifelong progress. The report recommends that states work to increase the
17 qualifications and compensation of childcare educators, including those who care for infants and
18 toddlers.
19 (5) Childcare educators are among the lowest paid workers in Rhode Island. In 2023, the

1 median wage of a childcare educator in Rhode Island was sixteen dollars and ninety-one cents
2 ($16.91) per hour.
3 (6) The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services provides significant funding to
4 Rhode Island through the Child Care and Development Block Grant and has established clear
5 guidelines for setting rates that provide low-income families with "equal access" to the childcare
6 market as required under federal law. The "equal access" guideline is to pay rates equal to or above
7 the seventy-fifth percentile of a recent market rate survey.
8 (7) The Rhode Island Governor’s Workforce Board recommends that Rhode Island pay
9 child care rates that meet or exceed the equal access standard as a first step to support program
10 quality and to improved wages and retention of child care educators. As of 2024, there were
11 seventeen (17) states that met or exceeded the equal access standard, including New York and
12 Vermont. Rhode Island’s base rate for infant care in a licensed child care center was at the 5th
13 percentile of the 2024 market rate survey, well below the 75th percentile equal access standard.
14 (8) The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has also established a clear
15 guideline for determining whether childcare is affordable. Currently, the federal guideline for
16 affordability is that families should pay no more than seven percent (7%) of family income for
17 childcare. Using that guideline, almost all families with young children in the State of Rhode Island
18 need a subsidy to afford the cost of high-quality childcare staffed by qualified, effective, and fairly-
19 compensated educators.
20 (9) The Federal Child Care and Development Block Grant focuses on helping lower income
21 families access child care, limiting the use of federal funds to families with incomes at or below
22 eighty-five percent (85%) of the state median income ($106,529) for a family of four in Rhode
23 Island in Federal Fiscal Year 2025), and allows states to waive this limit for children who are
24 members of a protected population such as children in foster care. As of 2024, there were sixteen
25 (16) states that set family income eligibility limits at or above eight-five percent (85%) of state
26 median income, including Maine, New Hampshire, New York and Vermont.
27 SECTION 2. Title 40 of the General Laws entitled "HUMAN SERVICES" is hereby
28 amended by adding thereto the following chapter:
29 CHAPTER 6.7
30 RHODE ISLAND CHILDCARE IS ESSENTIAL ACT
31 40-6.7-1. Childcare assistance - Families or assistance units eligible.
32 (a) The department of human services shall provide appropriate childcare to every
33 participant who is eligible for cash assistance and who requires childcare in order to meet the work
34 requirements in accordance with this chapter.
LC000920 - Page 2 of 13

1 (b) Low-income childcare. The department shall provide childcare to all other families with
2 incomes at or below eighty-five percent (85%) of the state median income, the low-income family
3 eligibility benchmark in the federal Childcare and Development Block Grant if, and to the extent,
4 these other families require childcare in order to work at paid employment and/or to participate in
5 training, apprenticeship, internship, on-the-job training, work experience, work immersion, or other
6 job-readiness/job- attachment programs sponsored or funded by the human resource investment
7 council (governor's workforce board) or state agencies that are part of the coordinated program
8 system pursuant to § 42-102-11. The department shall also provide childcare assistance to families
9 with incomes below eighty-five percent (85%) of the state median income when such assistance is
10 necessary for a member of these families to enroll or maintain enrollment in a Rhode Island public
11 institution of higher education.
12 (c) No family/assistance unit shall be eligible for childcare assistance under this chapter if
13 the combined value of its liquid resources exceeds one million dollars ($1,000,000), which
14 corresponds to the amount permitted by the federal government under the state plan and set forth
15 in the administrative rulemaking process by the department. As used in this section "liquid
16 resources" means any interest(s) in property in the form of cash or other financial instruments or
17 accounts that are readily convertible to cash or cash equivalents. These resources include, but are
18 not limited to: cash, bank, credit union, or other financial institution savings, checking, and money
19 market accounts; certificates of deposit or other time deposits; stocks; bonds; mutual funds; and
20 other similar financial instruments or accounts. These resources do not include educational savings
21 accounts, plans, or programs; retirement accounts, plans, or programs; or accounts held jointly with
22 another adult, not including a spouse. The department is authorized to promulgate rules and
23 regulations to determine the ownership and source of the funds in the joint account.
24 (d) The parent or caretaker relative of any family applying for childcare assistance may
25 voluntarily access the state’s office of child support services for assistance in locating the non-
26 custodial parent, establishing parentage, establishing a child support and/or medical order, and
27 enforcement of the order, but this shall not be a requirement to qualify for or access childcare
28 assistance.
29 (e) For purposes of this section, "appropriate childcare" means childcare, including infant,
30 toddler, preschool, nursery school, and school age, that is provided by a person or organization
31 qualified, approved, and authorized to provide the care by the state agency or agencies designated
32 to make the determinations in accordance with the provisions set forth in this section.
33 (f)(1) Families with incomes at or below one hundred percent (100%) of the applicable
34 federal poverty level guidelines shall be provided with free childcare. Families with incomes
LC000920 - Page 3 of 13

1 greater than one hundred percent (100%) of the applicable federal poverty guideline shall be
2 required to pay for some portion of the childcare they receive, according to a sliding-fee scale
3 adopted by the department in the department's rules, not to exceed seven percent (7%) of income
4 as defined in subsection (h) of this section.
5 (2) Families who are receiving childcare assistance and who become ineligible for
6 childcare assistance as a result of their incomes exceeding eighty-five percent (85%) of state
7 median income shall continue to be eligible for childcare assistance until their incomes exceeds
8 one hundred percent (100%) of the state median income. To be eligible, the families must continue
9 to pay for some portion of the childcare they receive, as indicated in a sliding-fee scale adopted in
10 the department's rules, not to exceed seven percent (7%) of income as defined in subsection (h) of
11 this section, and in accordance with other eligibility standards.
12 (g) In determining the type of childcare to be provided to a family, the department shall
13 take into account the cost of available childcare options, the suitability of the type of care available
14 for the child; and the parent's preference as to the type of childcare.
15 (h) For purposes of this section, “income” for families receiving cash assistance under §§
16 40-5.2-10(g)(2) and 40-5.2-10(g)(3), and income for other families shall mean gross, earned, and
17 unearned income as determined by departmental regulations.
18 (i) The caseload estimating conference established by chapter 17 of title 35 shall forecast
19 the expenditures for childcare in accordance with the provisions of § 35-17-1.
20 (j) In determining eligibility for childcare assistance for children of members of reserve
21 components called to active duty during a time of conflict, the department shall freeze the family
22 composition and the family income of the reserve component member as it was in the month prior
23 to the month of leaving for active duty. This freeze shall continue until the individual is officially
24 discharged from active duty.
25 40-6.7-2. Childcare assistance - Rates established.
26 (a) Effective July 1, 2025, the rates to be paid by the department of human services and the
27 department of children, youth and families for licensed childcare centers and family childcare

29 and shall be implemented in a tiered manner, reflective of the quality rating the provider has
30 achieved within the state's quality rating system outlined in § 42-12-23.1. All rates shall meet or
31 exceed the federal equal access benchmark (seventy-fifth percentile of the most recent Rhode Island
32 childcare market rate survey) and programs that have achieved a high-quality rating shall be paid
33 rates at or above the ninetieth percentile of the most recent Rhode Island childcare market rate

12 months who are receiving childcare assistance shall be paid an additional infant bonus rate equal

EXPLANATION
BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL
OF
A N A C T
RELATING TO HUMAN SERVICES -- RHODE ISLAND CHILDCARE IS ESSENTIAL ACT
***
1 This act would create the Rhode Island Childcare Assistance Program that governs both
2 family eligibility for the state’s childcare subsidy program and the rates paid to childcare providers
3 serving families receiving a subsidy. The act would expand eligibility for the program to meet the
4 federal eligibility benchmark so that families with incomes at or below eighty-five percent (85%)
5 of the state median income would be eligible. The act would allow families to continue eligibility
6 until their income exceeds one hundred percent (100%) of the state median income and would make
7 participation in the state’s child support enforcement program voluntary for the childcare subsidy.
8 The act would also increase the tiered rates of paid for licensed childcare centers to meet or exceed
9 the federal equal access benchmark, implement a new differential bonus rate for infants under age
10 eighteen (18) months and adopt fair payment practices consistent with the federal rules for the Child
11 Care and Development Fund.
12 This act would take effect on July 1, 2025.
