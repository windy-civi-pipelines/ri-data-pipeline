Introduced By: Senators Kallman, DiMario, Lauria, Mack, Quezada, Vargas, Gallo, and
Acosta
Date Introduced: February 07, 2025
Referred To: Senate Housing & Municipal Government
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. The general assembly hereby finds that:
2 (1) The state faces a severe and continuing housing crisis. Many state residents are unable
3 to obtain or retain affordable housing.
4 (2) This crisis has profoundly negative effects on the state. It causes dislocation, which
5 frays the social ties that bind our neighborhoods and communities together. It forces vulnerable
6 residents to leave their home, the state, for new communities where they are strangers. And it
7 contributes to homelessness, which is itself a severe and continuing crisis in the state.
8 (3) The state's housing crisis is caused, in large part, by a shortage of affordable rental
9 housing. The creation and preservation of such housing is therefore of paramount public concern.
10 (4) One obstacle to the creation and preservation of affordable rental housing is rapid
11 turnover in the state's real estate market. Nonprofit organizations seeking to create and preserve
12 affordable housing may be willing and able to pay market prices to purchase residential buildings
13 for sale, but nevertheless find themselves unable to purchase such buildings before they leave the
14 market. Nonprofit organizations serving the broader public interest must often move more
15 deliberately and borrow purchase money from non-traditional lenders in such real estate
16 transactions than private entities concerned solely with profit.
17 (5) The purpose of this chapter (which may be referred to as the "community opportunity
18 to purchase act") is to enhance nonprofit organizations' ability to purchase multi-family residential
19 buildings, at market prices, within a reasonable period of time and to thereby promote the creation
1 and preservation of affordable rental housing.
2 SECTION 2. Title 34 of the General Laws entitled "PROPERTY" is hereby amended by
3 adding thereto the following chapter:
4 CHAPTER 18.3

2 (iii) If an interest substantially equal to the value of the fee interest of the multi-family
3 residential building is held by any kind of corporate entity or partnership (including, but not limited
