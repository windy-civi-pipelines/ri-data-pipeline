12 the public schools of this state beginning in kindergarten and continuing through to and including

16 (b) All middle and high school students attending public schools, or any other schools
17 managed and controlled by the state, shall demonstrate proficiency, as defined by the local school

7 (2) Demonstrate an understanding of the connections between federal, state, and local
8 policies, including issues that may impact the student’s community.
9 (d) The department of education shall begin implementing subsections (b) and (c) of this
10 section for the 2022-2023 academic year.
