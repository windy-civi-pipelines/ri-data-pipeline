8 The general assembly finds that it is a fundamental right of parents to direct the upbringing,

10 information relating to a minor child should not be withheld, either inadvertently or purposefully,
11 from their parents, including information relating to the minor child's health, well-being, and
12 education, while the minor child is in the custody of the school district. The general assembly
13 further finds it is necessary to establish a consistent mechanism for parents to be notified of
14 information relating to the health and well-being of their minor children.
15 23-104-3. Infringement of parental rights.
16 (a) The state, any of its political subdivisions, any other governmental entity, or any other
17 institution may not infringe on the fundamental rights of a parent to direct the upbringing,
18 education, health care, and mental health of their minor child, without demonstrating that such
19 action is reasonable and necessary to achieve a compelling state interest and that such action is

1 narrowly tailored and is not otherwise served by a less restrictive means.
2 (b) For purposes of this chapter, the term "parent" means a person who has legal custody
3 of a minor child as a natural or adoptive parent or a legal guardian.
4 23-104-4. Parental rights.

8 (1) The right to direct the education and care of their minor child.
9 (2) The right to direct the upbringing and the moral and religious training of their minor
10 child.

22 shared, or stored.

25 pursuant to a court order.
26 (9) The right to consent in writing before the state or any of its political subdivisions makes
27 a video or voice recording of their minor child unless such recording is made during or as part of a

3 subdivisions, any other governmental entity, or any other institution suspects that a criminal offense
4 has been committed against their minor child, unless the incident has first been reported to law
5 enforcement or the department of children, youth and families and notifying the parents would
6 impede the investigation.

10 (2) Condone, authorize, approve, or apply to a parental action or decision that would end
