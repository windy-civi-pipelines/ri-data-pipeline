16 (a) The state, any of its political subdivisions, any other governmental entity, or any other
17 institution may not infringe on the fundamental rights of a parent to direct the upbringing,
18 education, health care, and mental health of their minor child, without demonstrating that such
19 action is reasonable and necessary to achieve a compelling state interest and that such action is

1 narrowly tailored and is not otherwise served by a less restrictive means.

3 subdivisions, any other governmental entity, or any other institution suspects that a criminal offense
4 has been committed against their minor child, unless the incident has first been reported to law
