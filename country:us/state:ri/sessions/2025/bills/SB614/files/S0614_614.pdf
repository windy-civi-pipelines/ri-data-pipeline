25 44-11-7.1. Limitations on assessment.
26 (a) General. Except as provided in this section, the amount of the Rhode Island corporate
27 income tax shall be assessed within three (3) years after the return was filed, whether or not the
28 return was filed on or after the prescribed date. For this purpose, a tax return filed before the due
29 date shall be considered as filed on the due date.
30 (b) Exceptions.
31 (1) The tax may be assessed at any time if:
32 (i) No return is filed.
33 (ii) A false or fraudulent return is filed with intent to avoid tax.

3 of the agreed upon period.
4 (3) If a taxpayer’s deficiency is attributable to an excessive net operating loss carryback
5 allowance, it may be assessed at any time that a deficiency for the taxable year of the loss may be
6 assessed.
7 (4) An erroneous refund shall be considered to create an underpayment of tax on the date
8 made. An assessment of a deficiency arising out of an erroneous refund may be made at any time
9 within three (3) years thereafter, or at any time if it appears that any part of the refund was induced
10 by fraud or misrepresentation of a material fact.
11 (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the tax may be assessed at any time
12 within six (6) years after the return was filed if a taxpayer omits from its Rhode Island income an
13 amount properly includable therein that is in excess of twenty-five percent (25%) of the amount of
14 Rhode Island income stated in the return. For this purpose there shall not be taken into account any
15 amount that is omitted in the return if the amount is disclosed in the return, or in a statement attached
16 to the return, in a manner adequate to apprise the tax administrator of the nature and amount of the
17 item.
18 (d) The running of the period of limitations on assessment or collection of the tax or other
19 amount, or of a transferee’s liability, shall, after the mailing of a notice of deficiency, be suspended

21 collecting by levy, and for sixty (60) days thereafter.
22 (e) No period of limitations specified in any other law shall apply to the assessment or
23 collection of Rhode Island corporate income tax. Under no circumstances shall the tax
24 administrator issue any notice of deficiency determination for Rhode Island business corporation
25 tax due and payable more than ten (10) years after the date upon which the return was filed or due
26 to be filed, nor shall the tax administrator commence any collection action for any business
27 corporation tax due and payable unless the collection action is commenced within ten (10) years
28 after a notice of deficiency determination became a final collectible assessment; provided however,
29 that the tax administrator may renew a statutory lien that was initially filed within the ten-year (10)
30 period for collection actions. Both of the aforementioned ten-year (10) periods are tolled for any
31 period of time the taxpayer is in federal bankruptcy or state receivership proceedings. “Collection
32 action” refers to any activity undertaken by the division of taxation to collect on any state tax
33 liabilities that are final, due, and payable under Rhode Island law. “Collection action” may include,

15 any other foreign business entity that is engaged in the business of buying, selling, leasing, renting,
16 managing, or dealing in real estate, shall be fraudulent and void as against the state unless the
17 corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership, or any other business entity, whether
18 domestic or foreign, at least five (5) business days before the sale or transfer, notifies the tax
19 administrator of the proposed sale or transfer and of the price, terms, and conditions of the sale or
20 transfer and of the character and location of the assets by requesting a letter of good standing from
21 the tax division. Such notification must be received by the division of taxation at least five (5)
22 business days before the sale or transfer. Whenever a corporation, limited liability company, limited
23 partnership, or any other business entity, whether domestic or foreign, makes such a sale or transfer,

33 44-18-30B. Exemption from sales tax for sales by writers, composers, artists —
34 Findings.
LC001321 - Page 7 of 15

1 (a) The general assembly makes the following findings of facts:
2 (1) The arts and culture are a significant asset for Rhode Island, one that generates revenue
3 through increased tourism and economic activity; creates jobs and economic opportunities;
4 revitalizes communities adding to quality of life and property values; and fosters creativity,
5 innovation, and entrepreneurship.
6 (2) Since 1998, the establishment of arts districts, where “one-of-a-kind, limited-
7 production” works of art may be sold exempt from state sales tax, has resulted in an increased
8 presence for the arts in designated cities and towns, with benefits to those communities and to the
9 state.
10 (3) Since the establishment of arts districts, many communities have sought legislation to
11 expand the program to their city or town.
12 (4) There is value in expanding the arts district program statewide, providing incentives for
13 the sale and purchase of art. This is a unique opportunity for Rhode Island to shape history, and
14 gain an advantage over other states, by becoming the first-and-only state in the country to declare
15 a statewide sales tax exemption on art. This will strengthen Rhode Island’s identity as an arts-
16 friendly destination and “State of the Arts.”
17 (b)(1) This section only applies to sales by writers, composers, and artists residing in and
18 conducting a business within the state of Rhode Island. For the purposes of this section, a “work”
19 means an original and creative work, whether written, composed, or executed for “one-of-a-kind,
20 limited production” that falls into one of the following categories:
21 (i) A book or other writing;
22 (ii) A play or the performance of said play;
23 (iii) A musical composition or the performance of said composition;
24 (iv) A painting, print, photograph, or other like picture;
25 (v) A sculpture;
26 (vi) Traditional and fine crafts;
27 (vii) The creation of a film or the acting within the film; or
28 (viii) The creation of a dance or the performance of the dance.
29 (2) For the purposes of this section, a “work” includes any product generated as a result of
30 any of the above categories.
31 (3) For the purposes of this section, a “work” does not apply to any piece or performance
32 created or executed for industry-oriented, commercial, or related production.
33 (c)(1) This section applies to sales by any individual:
34 (i) Who is a resident of, and has a principal place of business situated in, the state of Rhode
LC001321 - Page 8 of 15

1 Island.
2 (ii) Who is determined by the tax administrator in consultation with the Rhode Island
3 council on the arts, after consideration of any evidence he or she deems necessary or that is
4 submitted to him or her by the individual, to have written, composed, or executed, either solely or
5 jointly, a work or works that would fall into one of the categories listed in subsection (b)(1).
6 (2) This section also applies to sales by any other gallery located in the state of Rhode
7 Island.
8 (3) The tax administrator shall not make a determination unless:
9 (i) The individual(s) concerned duly make(s) an application to the tax administrator for the
10 sales tax exemption that applies to the works defined in this section; and
11 (ii) The individual has complied and continues to comply with any and all requests made
12 by the tax administrator.
13 (d) Any individual to whom this section applies, and who makes an application to the tax
14 administrator, is entitled to a sales tax exemption for the sale of a work or works sold from the
15 individual’s business located in the State of Rhode Island that would, apart from this section, be
16 subject to the tax rate imposed by the state of Rhode Island.
17 (e) When an individual makes a request for the exemption, the tax administrator is entitled
18 to all books, documents, or other evidence relating to the publication, production, or creation of the
19 works that may be deemed necessary by the tax administrator for the purposes of the exemption.
20 The time period in which to provide this information is in the sole discretion of the tax administrator
21 and specified in the notice.
22 (f) In addition to the information required in subsection (e), the tax administrator may
23 require the individual(s) to submit an annual, certified accounting of the numbers of works sold;
24 the type of work sold; and the date of the sale. Failure to file this report may, in the sole discretion
25 of the tax administrator, terminate the individual’s eligibility for the exemption.
26 (g) Any person storing, using, or otherwise consuming in this state any work or works
27 deemed to be exempt from the sales tax pursuant to this section is not liable for the use tax on the
28 work or works.
29 (h) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, any individual to whom this section may
30 apply shall comply with all the administration, collection, and other provisions of chapters 18 and
31 19 of this title.
32 (i) The certificate of exemption shall be valid for four (4) years from the date of issue. All
33 certificates issued prior to the effective date of this section shall expire four (4) years from the
34 effective date of this section.

1 (4)(j) The Rhode Island council on the arts will oversee the transition to a statewide arts
2 district program and work with the state tourism agencies; local chambers of commerce; and
3 advertising/marketing agencies to promote this program, and will coordinate its efforts with the
4 city and town governments. The Rhode Island council on the arts may request, and shall receive,
5 from any department, division, board, bureau, commission, or agency of the state any data,
6 assistance, and resources, including additional personnel, that will enable it to properly carry out
7 this program.
8 (5) The tax administrator, in cooperation with the Rhode Island council on the arts, will
9 gather data to assess the overall impact of the statewide arts district program, and issue an annual
10 report, including, but not be limited to, the impact of the tax exemption on employment, tourism,
11 sales, and spending within the arts sector and adjacent businesses, and any other factors that
12 describe the impact of the program.
13 SECTION 6. Section 44-19-13 of the General Laws in Chapter 44-19 entitled "Sales and

22 return is filed, whichever period expires later, unless a longer period is agreed upon by the tax
23 administrator and the taxpayer.
24 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, under no circumstances
25 shall the tax administrator issue a notice of a deficiency determination for any sales or use tax
26 determined to be due and payable more than ten (10) years after the return is filed or was due to be
27 filed, nor shall the tax administrator commence any collection action for any tax that is due and
28 payable unless the collection action is commenced within ten (10) years after a notice of a
29 deficiency determination becomes a final collectible assessment; provided, however, that the tax
30 administrator may renew a statutory lien that was initially filed within the ten-year (10) period for
31 collection actions. Both of the aforementioned ten-year (10) periods are tolled for any period of
32 time the taxpayer is in federal bankruptcy or state receivership proceedings. “Collection action”
33 refers to any activity undertaken by the division of taxation to collect on any state tax liabilities that

22 the tax administrator.
23 (b) Every holder of a dealer’s license shall annually, on or before February 1 of each year,
24 renew its license by filing an application for renewal along with a twenty-five dollar ($25.00)
25 renewal fee. The renewal license is valid for the period July 1 of that calendar year through June

LC001321 - Page 11 of 15

1 (a) The tax imposed by § 44-22-1.1 shall be assessed upon the full and fair cash value of
2 the net estate determined by the tax administrator as provided in this chapter. Notice of the amount
3 of the tax shall be mailed to the executor, administrator, or trustee, but failure to receive the notice
4 does not excuse the nonpayment of or invalidate the tax. The tax administrator shall receive and
5 collect the assessed taxes in the same manner and with the same powers as are prescribed for and
6 given to the collectors of taxes by chapters 7 — 9 of this title. The tax shall be due and payable as
7 provided in § 44-23-16, shall be paid to the tax administrator, and shall be and remain a lien upon
8 the estate until it is paid. All executors, administrators, and trustees are personally liable for the tax
9 until it is paid.
10 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, under no circumstances
11 shall the tax administrator issue any notice of deficiency determination for the amount of the estate
12 tax due more than ten (10) years after the return was filed or should have been filed, nor shall the
13 tax administrator commence any collection action for any estate tax due and payable unless the
14 collection action is commenced within ten (10) years after the date a notice of deficiency
15 determination became a final collectible assessment. “Collection action” refers to any activity
16 undertaken by the division of taxation to collect on any state tax liabilities that are final, due, and
17 payable under Rhode Island law. “Collection action” may include, but is not limited to, any civil
18 action involving a liability owed under chapters 22 and 23 of title 44.
19 (c) The ten-year (10) limitation shall not apply to the renewal or continuation of the state’s
20 attempt to collect a liability that became final, due, and payable within the ten-year (10) limitation
21 periods set forth in this section.
22 SECTION 9. Section 44-30-83 of the General Laws in Chapter 44-30 entitled "Personal
23 Income Tax" is hereby amended to read as follows:
24 44-30-83. Limitations on assessment.
25 (a) General. Except as otherwise provided in this section the amount of the Rhode Island
26 personal income tax shall be assessed within three (3) years after the return was filed, whether or
27 not the return was filed on or after the prescribed date. For this purpose a tax return filed before the
28 due date shall be considered as filed on the due date; and a return of withholding tax for any period
29 ending with or within a calendar year filed before April 15 of the succeeding calendar year shall be
30 considered filed on April 15 of the succeeding calendar year.
31 (b) Exceptions.
32 (1) Assessment at any time. The tax may be assessed at any time if:
33 (i) No return is filed;
34 (ii) A false or fraudulent return is filed with intent to evade tax; or
LC001321 - Page 12 of 15

1 (iii) The taxpayer fails to file a report, pursuant to § 44-30-59, of a change, correction, or
2 amended return, increasing his or her federal taxable income as reported on his or her federal
3 income tax return or to report a change or correction that is treated in the same manner as if it were
4 a deficiency for federal income tax purposes.
5 (2) Extension by agreement. Where, before the expiration of the time prescribed in this
6 section for the assessment of tax, or before the time as extended pursuant to this section, both the
7 tax administrator and the taxpayer have consented in writing to its assessment after that time, the
8 tax may be assessed at any time prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon.
9 (3) Report of changed or corrected federal income. If the taxpayer shall, pursuant to § 44-
10 30-59, file an amended return, or report a change or correction increasing his or her federal taxable
11 income or report a change or correction that is treated in the same manner as if it were a deficiency
12 for federal income tax purposes, an assessment may be made at any time prior to two (2) years after
13 the report or amended return was filed. This assessment of Rhode Island personal income tax shall
14 not exceed the amount of the increase attributable to the federal change, correction, or items
15 amended on the taxpayer’s amended federal income tax return. The provisions of this paragraph
16 shall not affect the time within which or the amount for which an assessment may otherwise be
17 made.
18 (4) Deficiency attributable to net operating loss carryback. If a taxpayer’s deficiency is
19 attributable to an excessive net operating loss carryback allowance, it may be assessed at any time
20 that a deficiency for the taxable year of the loss may be assessed.
21 (5) Recovery of erroneous refund. An erroneous refund shall be considered to create an
22 underpayment of tax on the date made. An assessment of a deficiency arising out of an erroneous
23 refund may be made at any time within three (3) years thereafter, or at any time if it appears that
24 any part of the refund was induced by fraud or misrepresentation of a material fact.
25 (6) Armed forces relief. For purposes of this tax, the date appearing in 26 U.S.C. § 692(a)
26 shall be January 1, 1971.
27 (c) Omission of income on return. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section,
28 the tax may be assessed at any time within six (6) years after the return was filed if an individual
29 omits from his or her Rhode Island income an amount properly includible therein which is in excess
30 of twenty-five percent (25%) of the amount of Rhode Island income stated in the return. For this
31 purpose there shall not be taken into account any amount that is omitted in the return if the amount
32 is disclosed in the return, or in a statement attached to the return, in a manner adequate to apprise
33 the tax administrator of the nature and amount of the item.
34 (d) Suspension of limitation. The running of the period of limitations on assessment or
LC001321 - Page 13 of 15

1 collection of tax or other amount (or of a transferee’s liability) shall, after the mailing of a notice
2 of deficiency, be suspended for the period during which the tax administrator is prohibited under §
3 44-30-81(c) from making the assessment or from collecting by levy, and for sixty (60) days
4 thereafter.
5 (e) Limitations exclusive. No period of limitations specified in any other law shall apply to
6 the assessment or collection of Rhode Island personal income tax. Under no circumstances shall
7 the tax administrator issue any notice of a deficiency determination for Rhode Island personal
8 income tax due or payable more than ten (10) years after the date upon which the return was filed
9 or due to be filed, nor shall the tax administrator commence any collection action for any personal
10 income tax due and payable unless the collection action is commenced within ten (10) years after
11 a notice of deficiency determination became a final collectible assessment; provided however, that
12 the tax administrator can renew a statutory lien that was initially filed within the ten-year (10)
13 period for collection actions. Both of the aforementioned ten-year (10) periods are tolled for any
14 period of time the taxpayer is in federal bankruptcy or state receivership proceedings. “Collection
15 action” refers to any activity undertaken by the division of taxation to collect on any state tax
16 liabilities that are final, due, and payable under Rhode Island law. “Collection action” may include,
17 but is not limited to, any civil action involving a liability owed under chapter 30 of title 44. This
18 section excludes any liabilities that are deemed trust funds as defined in § 44-30-76, as amended.
19 (f) The ten-year (10) limitation shall not apply to the renewal or continuation of the state’s
20 attempt to collect a liability that became final, due, and payable within the ten-year (10) limitation
21 periods set forth in this section.
22 SECTION 10. Sections 1 and 2 of this act shall take effect January 1, 2026, and sections 3
23 through 9 shall take effect upon passage.
