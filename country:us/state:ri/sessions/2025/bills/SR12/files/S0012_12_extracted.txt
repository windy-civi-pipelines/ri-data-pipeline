HISTORIC AND EXTRAORDINARY VICTORY IN THE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
Introduced By: Senator Jessica de la Cruz
Date Introduced: January 28, 2025
Referred To: Recommended for Immediate Consideration
1 WHEREAS, President Donald Trump, the 45th, and now the 47th President, stunned the
2 political world by becoming the first President since Grover Cleveland to be elected to two non-
3 consecutive terms to serve as the President of the United States; and
4 WHEREAS, President Donald John Trump was born in in Queens, New York, in 1946, a
5 son of Fred Trump and Mary Anne MacLeod. President Trump graduated from the University of
6 Pennsylvania with a bachelor’s degree in economics, and then proceeded to focus his professional
7 business career on expanding the Trump family’s real estate business. Trump became initially
8 famous as a celebrity businessman working primarily in the metro New York City area. He
9 became known for building luxury hotels, luxury golf courses, and opining on issues related to
10 the economy, local New York metro area issues, and world affairs. President Trump also hosted
11 the hit reality television series the Apprentice and was widely recognized as being one of the
12 leading and most successful business magnates in the world; and
13 WHEREAS, In 2015, Donald Trump surprised observers when he announced his
14 candidacy for the Presidency. Running as a Republican, he stunned observers when he easily won
15 the GOP nomination and then shocked the world when he defeated Hillary Clinton to win the
16 2016 election. Trump’s winning campaign was focused on reducing illegal immigration and
17 securing America’s borders, cracking down on crime, cutting taxes, energy independence and
18 producing more oil and gas on American soil, and putting America first on a host of foreign
19 policy issues, including pressuring fellow NATO members to become less reliant on American
1 largesse and to pay their fair share in support of NATO and European security; and
2 WHEREAS, President Trump’s first term ushered in an unprecedented economic boom
3 and built the world’s most prosperous economy marked by a low inflation rate of 1.9 percent, and
4 an unemployment rate of 5.04 percent that was much lower for most of his term until COVID-19
5 negatively impacted the United States and world economies. President Trump was particularly
6 proud of the low unemployment rates during his term for African-Americans and the resurgence
7 of manufacturing and energy independence under his watch. Another focus of President Trump
8 during his first term was the negotiation of what he termed “fair trade deals” with other nations.
9 Donald Trump campaigned tirelessly in support of the American worker and “American Jobs and
10 businesses” that employed American workers. Trump’s foreign policy goals were similarly
11 focused on “America First” principles, and he was very proud that no new wars were started
12 during his administration. Trump also showed a willingness to break new ground and push back
13 against boundaries in his quest for peace; and
14 WHEREAS, In his first term as President of the United States of America, President
15 Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the largest tax reform package in history, which
16 doubled the standard deduction and doubled the child tax credit. President Trump ended the
17 regulatory assault on American businesses and workers, eliminating eight old regulations for
18 every one new regulation adopted. President Trump also unleashed America’s oil and natural gas
19 potential and increased access to our country’s abundant natural resources in order to achieve
20 energy independence. President Trump signed the bipartisan First Step Act into law, the first
21 criminal justice reform legislation ever passed to reduce recidivism and help former inmates
22 successfully rejoin society. President Trump established the Space Force, the first new branch of
23 the United States Armed Forces since 1947, appointed three Supreme Court Justices: Neil
24 Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett, built over 400 miles of the world’s most
25 robust and advanced border wall, and brought unprecedented attention and support to combat the
26 opioid crisis; and
27 WHEREAS, After losing a closely contested election in 2020 to president Joseph Biden,
28 most political observers assumed that President Trump’s political career was over. Once again,
29 President Trump’s supposed permanent demise turned out not to be true, as Donald Trump would
30 once again stun and astound all political observers in 2024; and
31 WHEREAS, President Trump won the Presidency in 2024, championing issues related to
32 border security, cracking down on illegal immigration and crime, finding a way to end the war in
33 the Ukraine started by Russia and its President Vladimir Putin, and getting America’s hostages
34 returned from Gaza . President Trump once again easily won the GOP primary to secure the
LC000565 - Page 2 of 3
1 Republican nomination and ran a highly successful populist campaign in the fall against Vice
2 President Kamala Harris. President Trump again exhibited his proclivity for thinking and
3 campaigning in new ways, from driving a garbage truck during a campaign event to working for a
4 day at McDonalds, where he cooked food and served customers through the drive-thru window;
5 and
6 WHEREAS, Once again, President Trump stunned the world, winning all of the swing
7 states on his way to a 312 to 226 electoral college victory, and winning the popular vote in this
8 election by more than two million votes; and
9 WHEREAS, President Trump is the devoted husband of Melania Trump and the proud
10 father of Donald Trump, Jr., Ivanka Trump, Eric Trump, Tiffany Trump and Barron Trump; now,
11 therefore be it
12 RESOLVED, That this Senate of the State of Rhode Island hereby congratulates Donald
13 J. Trump on his inauguration and historic victory in the 2024 presidential election and wishes him
14 a successful presidency as the 47th President of the United States; and be it further
15 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
16 transmit a duly certified copy of this resolution to President Donald John Trump.
