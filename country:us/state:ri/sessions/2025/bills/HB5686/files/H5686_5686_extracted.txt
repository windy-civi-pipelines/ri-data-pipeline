LC001771 - Page 5 of 12
1 wetlands located in the vicinity of the coast and under the exclusive jurisdiction of the director of
2 the department of environmental management. For the purpose of this chapter, a “coastal wetland”
3 means any salt marsh bordering on the tidal waters of this state, whether or not the tidal waters
4 reach the littoral areas through natural or artificial watercourses, and those uplands directly
5 associated and contiguous thereto which are necessary to preserve the integrity of that marsh.
6 Marshes shall include those areas upon which grow one or more of the following: smooth cordgrass
7 (spartina alterniflora), salt meadow grass (spartina patens), spike grass (distichlis spicata), black

16 physiographic feature, or where there is a reasonable probability of conflict with a plan or program
17 for resources management or damage to the coastal environment.
18 (iv) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (ii) and (iii) above, the department of
19 environmental management shall maintain jurisdiction over the administration of chapter 1, title 2,
20 including permitting of freshwater wetlands alterations and enforcement, with respect to all
21 agricultural activities undertaken by a farmer, as that term is defined in § 2-1-22(j), wherever
22 located; provided, however, that with respect to activities located partially or completely within
23 two hundred feet (200′) of the coastal physiographic feature, the department shall exercise
24 jurisdiction in consultation with the council.
25 (3) Coordination. The council has the following coordinating powers and duties:
26 (i) Functioning as a binding arbitrator in any matter of dispute involving both the resources
27 of the state’s coastal region and the interests of two (2) or more municipalities or state agencies.

2 Rhode Island resource recovery corporation prior to purchasing cover material for the state landfill
3 shall first contact the CRMC to see if there is a source of suitable dredged material available which
4 shall be used in place of the purchase cover material. Other state agencies engaged in the process
5 of dump closures shall also contact the CRMC to see if there is a source of suitable dredged material
6 available, which shall be used in place of the purchase cover material. In addition, cities and towns
7 may contact the CRMC prior to closing city or town controlled dump sites to see if there is a source
8 of suitable dredge material available, which may be used in place of the purchase cover material.
9 (vi) Acting as the state’s representative to all bodies public and private on all coastal and
10 aquaculture related matters.
11 (4) Operations. The council is authorized to exercise the following operating functions,

25 program, but not including those facilities defined in 300.4 of the Rhode Island coastal resources
26 management program, and which is capable of offloading cargo, and is or will be subject to a new
27 use or a significant intensification of an existing use, to demonstrate that the commercial wharf or
28 pier is fit for that purpose. For the purposes of this subsection, a “commercial wharf or pier” means
29 a pier, bulkhead, wharf, docking facility, or underwater utilities. The council may order said owner
30 or operator to provide an engineering certification to the council’s satisfaction that the commercial
31 wharf or pier is fit for the new use or intensification of an existing use. If the council determines
32 that the commercial wharf or pier is not fit, it may order the owner or operator to undertake the
33 necessary work to make the commercial wharf or pier safe, within a reasonable time frame. If the
34 council determines that the commercial wharf or pier, because of its condition, is an immediate
LC001771 - Page 7 of 12
1 threat to public health and safety it may order the commercial wharf or pier closed until the
2 necessary work to make the commercial wharf or pier safe has been performed and approved by
3 the council. All work performed must conform to the council’s management program. The council
4 is also given the authority to develop regulations to carry out this provision and to impose
5 administrative penalties of five thousand dollars ($5,000) per day up to a maximum of twenty
6 thousand dollars ($20,000) consistent with § 46-23-7.1 where there has been a violation of the
7 orders under this provision.
8 (5) Rights-of-way.(i) The council is responsible for the designation of all public rights-of-
9 way to the tidal water areas of the state, and shall carry on a continuing discovery of appropriate
10 public rights-of-way to the tidal water areas of the state.
11 (ii) The council shall maintain a complete file of all official documents relating to the legal
12 status of all public rights-of-way to the tidal water areas of the state.
13 (iii)(A) The council has the power to designate for acquisition and development, and
14 posting, and all other functions of any other department for tidal rights-of-way and land for tidal
15 rights-of-way, parking facilities, and other council related purposes.
16 (B) Further, the council has the power to develop and prescribe a standard sign to be used
17 by the cities and towns to mark designated rights-of-way.
18 (iv) In conjunction with this subdivision, every state department controlling state-owned
19 land close to or adjacent to discovered rights-of-way is authorized to set out the land, or so much
20 of the land that may be deemed necessary for public parking.
21 (v) No use of land for public parking shall conflict with existing or intended use of the land,
22 and no improvement shall be undertaken by any state agency until detailed plans have been
23 submitted to and approved by the governing body of the local municipality.
24 (vi) In designating rights-of-way, the council shall consider the following matters in

34 substantial evidence. A copy of the final council determination, and all official documents related
LC001771 - Page 8 of 12
1 to the council determination, shall be provided to the municipality in which the right-of-way is
2 located.
3 (viii) Municipalities shall be required to identify and maintain a current list of public rights-
4 of-way to the tidal water areas in their municipality that have been designated by the council in
5 accordance with this section. Municipal identification of the council’s designated public rights-of-
6 way shall also be incorporated and displayed on official maps in accordance with § 45-23.1-1. Non-
7 compliance with this municipal responsibility shall have no effect on the council designation
8 process or final determinations by the council that are set forth in this section.
9 (viii)(ix) The council shall be notified whenever by the judgment of the governing body of
10 a coastal municipality, a public right-of-way to tidal water areas located in such municipality has
11 ceased to be useful to the public, and such governing body proposes an order of abandonment of
12 such public right-of-way. Said notice shall be given not less than sixty (60) days prior to the date
13 of such abandonment.
14 (6) Pre-existing residential boating facilities.(i) The council is hereby authorized and
15 empowered to issue assent for pre-existing residential boating facilities constructed prior to January

25 (C) The facility presents no significant threat to the coastal resources of the state of Rhode
26 Island or human safety.
27 (iii) The applicant, to be eligible for this provision, shall apply no later than January 31,
28 1999.
29 (iv) The council is directed to develop rules and regulations necessary to implement this
30 subdivision.
31 (v) It is the specific intent of this subsection to require that all pre-existing residential
32 boating facilities constructed on January 1, 1985, or thereafter conform to this chapter and the plans,
33 rules and regulations of the council.
34 (7) Lease of filled lands which were formerly tidal lands to riparian or littoral owners.(i)
LC001771 - Page 9 of 12
1 Any littoral or riparian owner in this state who desires to obtain a lease from the state of Rhode
2 Island of any filled lands adjacent to his or her upland shall apply to the council, which may make
3 the lease. Any littoral or riparian owner who wishes to obtain a lease of filled lands must obtain
4 pre-approval, in the form of an assent, from the council. Any lease granted by the council shall
5 continue the public’s interest in the filled lands including, but not limited to, the rights of
6 navigation, fishery, and commerce. The public trust in the lands shall continue and run concurrently
7 with the leasing of the lands by the state to private individuals, corporations, or municipalities.
8 Upon the granting of a lease by the council, those rights consistent with the public trust and secured
9 by the lease shall vest in the lessee. The council may approve a lease of filled lands for an initial
10 term of up to fifty (50) years, with, or without, a single option to renew for an additional term of
11 up to fifty (50) years.
12 (ii) The lessor of the lease, at any time, for cause, may by express act cancel and annul any
13 lease previously made to the riparian owner when it determines that the use of the lands is violating
14 the terms of the lease or is inconsistent with the public trust, and upon cancellation the lands, and
15 rights in the land so leased, shall revert to the state.
16 (8) “Marinas” as defined in the coastal resources management program in effect as of June
17 1, 1997, are deemed to be one of the uses consistent with the public trust. Subdivision (7) is not
18 applicable to:
19 (i) Any riparian owner on tidal waters in this state (and any successor in interest to the
20 owner) which has an assent issued by the council to use any land under water in front of his or her
21 lands as a marina, which assent was in effect on June 1, 1997;
22 (ii) Any alteration, expansion, or other activity at a marina (and any successor in interest)
23 which has an assent issued by the council, which assent was in effect on June 1, 1997; and
24 (iii) Any renewal of assent to a marina (or successor in interest), which assent was issued
25 by the council and in effect on June 1, 1997.
26 (9) “Recreational boating facilities” including marinas, launching ramps, and recreational
27 mooring areas, as defined by and properly permitted by the council, are deemed to be one of the
28 uses consistent with the public trust. Subdivision (7) is not applicable to:
29 (i) Any riparian owner on tidal waters in this state (and any successor in interest to the
30 owner) which has an assent issued by the council to use any land under water in front of his or her
31 lands as a recreational boating facility; any alteration, expansion or other activity at a recreational
32 boating facility (and any successor in interest) which has an assent issued by the council, which
33 assent was in effect as of June 1, 1997; and
34 (ii) Any renewal of assent to a recreational boating facility (or successor in interest), which
LC001771 - Page 10 of 12
1 assent was issued by the council and in effect on June 1, 1997.

16 physiographic feature, or where there is a reasonable probability of conflict with a plan or program
17 for resources management or damage to the coastal environment.
18 (iv) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (ii) and (iii) above, the department of
19 environmental management shall maintain jurisdiction over the administration of chapter 1, title 2,
20 including permitting of freshwater wetlands alterations and enforcement, with respect to all
21 agricultural activities undertaken by a farmer, as that term is defined in § 2-1-22(j), wherever
22 located; provided, however, that with respect to activities located partially or completely within
23 two hundred feet (200′) of the coastal physiographic feature, the department shall exercise
24 jurisdiction in consultation with the council.
25 (3) Coordination. The council has the following coordinating powers and duties:
26 (i) Functioning as a binding arbitrator in any matter of dispute involving both the resources
27 of the state’s coastal region and the interests of two (2) or more municipalities or state agencies.

25 program, but not including those facilities defined in 300.4 of the Rhode Island coastal resources
26 management program, and which is capable of offloading cargo, and is or will be subject to a new
27 use or a significant intensification of an existing use, to demonstrate that the commercial wharf or
28 pier is fit for that purpose. For the purposes of this subsection, a “commercial wharf or pier” means
29 a pier, bulkhead, wharf, docking facility, or underwater utilities. The council may order said owner
30 or operator to provide an engineering certification to the council’s satisfaction that the commercial
31 wharf or pier is fit for the new use or intensification of an existing use. If the council determines
32 that the commercial wharf or pier is not fit, it may order the owner or operator to undertake the
33 necessary work to make the commercial wharf or pier safe, within a reasonable time frame. If the
34 council determines that the commercial wharf or pier, because of its condition, is an immediate
LC001771 - Page 7 of 12

1 threat to public health and safety it may order the commercial wharf or pier closed until the
2 necessary work to make the commercial wharf or pier safe has been performed and approved by
3 the council. All work performed must conform to the council’s management program. The council
4 is also given the authority to develop regulations to carry out this provision and to impose
5 administrative penalties of five thousand dollars ($5,000) per day up to a maximum of twenty
6 thousand dollars ($20,000) consistent with § 46-23-7.1 where there has been a violation of the
7 orders under this provision.
8 (5) Rights-of-way.(i) The council is responsible for the designation of all public rights-of-
9 way to the tidal water areas of the state, and shall carry on a continuing discovery of appropriate
10 public rights-of-way to the tidal water areas of the state.
11 (ii) The council shall maintain a complete file of all official documents relating to the legal
12 status of all public rights-of-way to the tidal water areas of the state.
13 (iii)(A) The council has the power to designate for acquisition and development, and
14 posting, and all other functions of any other department for tidal rights-of-way and land for tidal
15 rights-of-way, parking facilities, and other council related purposes.
16 (B) Further, the council has the power to develop and prescribe a standard sign to be used
17 by the cities and towns to mark designated rights-of-way.
18 (iv) In conjunction with this subdivision, every state department controlling state-owned
19 land close to or adjacent to discovered rights-of-way is authorized to set out the land, or so much
20 of the land that may be deemed necessary for public parking.
21 (v) No use of land for public parking shall conflict with existing or intended use of the land,
22 and no improvement shall be undertaken by any state agency until detailed plans have been
23 submitted to and approved by the governing body of the local municipality.
24 (vi) In designating rights-of-way, the council shall consider the following matters in

34 substantial evidence. A copy of the final council determination, and all official documents related
LC001771 - Page 8 of 12

1 to the council determination, shall be provided to the municipality in which the right-of-way is
2 located.
3 (viii) Municipalities shall be required to identify and maintain a current list of public rights-
4 of-way to the tidal water areas in their municipality that have been designated by the council in
5 accordance with this section. Municipal identification of the council’s designated public rights-of-
6 way shall also be incorporated and displayed on official maps in accordance with § 45-23.1-1. Non-
7 compliance with this municipal responsibility shall have no effect on the council designation
8 process or final determinations by the council that are set forth in this section.
9 (viii)(ix) The council shall be notified whenever by the judgment of the governing body of
10 a coastal municipality, a public right-of-way to tidal water areas located in such municipality has
11 ceased to be useful to the public, and such governing body proposes an order of abandonment of
12 such public right-of-way. Said notice shall be given not less than sixty (60) days prior to the date
13 of such abandonment.
14 (6) Pre-existing residential boating facilities.(i) The council is hereby authorized and

25 (C) The facility presents no significant threat to the coastal resources of the state of Rhode
26 Island or human safety.
27 (iii) The applicant, to be eligible for this provision, shall apply no later than January 31,
28 1999.
29 (iv) The council is directed to develop rules and regulations necessary to implement this
30 subdivision.
31 (v) It is the specific intent of this subsection to require that all pre-existing residential
32 boating facilities constructed on January 1, 1985, or thereafter conform to this chapter and the plans,
33 rules and regulations of the council.
34 (7) Lease of filled lands which were formerly tidal lands to riparian or littoral owners.(i)
LC001771 - Page 9 of 12

1 Any littoral or riparian owner in this state who desires to obtain a lease from the state of Rhode
2 Island of any filled lands adjacent to his or her upland shall apply to the council, which may make
3 the lease. Any littoral or riparian owner who wishes to obtain a lease of filled lands must obtain
4 pre-approval, in the form of an assent, from the council. Any lease granted by the council shall
5 continue the public’s interest in the filled lands including, but not limited to, the rights of
6 navigation, fishery, and commerce. The public trust in the lands shall continue and run concurrently
7 with the leasing of the lands by the state to private individuals, corporations, or municipalities.
8 Upon the granting of a lease by the council, those rights consistent with the public trust and secured
9 by the lease shall vest in the lessee. The council may approve a lease of filled lands for an initial
10 term of up to fifty (50) years, with, or without, a single option to renew for an additional term of
11 up to fifty (50) years.
12 (ii) The lessor of the lease, at any time, for cause, may by express act cancel and annul any
13 lease previously made to the riparian owner when it determines that the use of the lands is violating
14 the terms of the lease or is inconsistent with the public trust, and upon cancellation the lands, and
15 rights in the land so leased, shall revert to the state.
16 (8) “Marinas” as defined in the coastal resources management program in effect as of June
17 1, 1997, are deemed to be one of the uses consistent with the public trust. Subdivision (7) is not
18 applicable to:
19 (i) Any riparian owner on tidal waters in this state (and any successor in interest to the
20 owner) which has an assent issued by the council to use any land under water in front of his or her
21 lands as a marina, which assent was in effect on June 1, 1997;
22 (ii) Any alteration, expansion, or other activity at a marina (and any successor in interest)
23 which has an assent issued by the council, which assent was in effect on June 1, 1997; and
24 (iii) Any renewal of assent to a marina (or successor in interest), which assent was issued
25 by the council and in effect on June 1, 1997.
26 (9) “Recreational boating facilities” including marinas, launching ramps, and recreational
27 mooring areas, as defined by and properly permitted by the council, are deemed to be one of the
28 uses consistent with the public trust. Subdivision (7) is not applicable to:
