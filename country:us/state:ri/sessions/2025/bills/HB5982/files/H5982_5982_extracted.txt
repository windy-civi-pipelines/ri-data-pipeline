Introduced By: Representatives Felix, Morales, Alzate, Diaz, Potter, Tanzi, Sanchez,
Kislak, Batista, and Cruz
Date Introduced: February 28, 2025
Referred To: House Finance
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Findings.
2 The general assembly hereby finds and declares that:
3 (1) Consistent with § 42-5.1-1(l), proficiency in a second or multiple languages can be a
4 major tool for economic growth for our state and help overcome this country's disadvantage in the
5 world economy as we move into the twenty-first century.
6 (2) Consistent with § 42-5.1-1(j), the state both affirms the right of every resident to nurture
7 their native language and also encourages all citizens to become proficient in English to facilitate
8 full participation in society and promote cross-cultural communication.
9 (3) Consistent with § 42-5.1-1(j) and (k), native language instruction facilitates the
10 development of English proficiency with multilingual learners and boosts the overall academic
11 achievement of such children.
12 (4) Consistent with § 16-22-37, the department of education ("department"), in consultation
13 with local education agencies ("LEAs") that have a dual language program, was mandated to create
14 a model policy and timeline to assist LEAs in developing and implementing a dual language
15 program.
16 (5) The Rhode Island Blueprint for a Multilingual Learner Success (2021) calls for
17 expansion of opportunities for MLLs to access high-quality bilingual/bicultural programs while
18 developing literacies in multiple languages.
19 (6) There is overwhelming evidence that the state could expect a very high return to the
1 public by investing in high quality bilingual and dual language programming for all of our students.
2 (7) Dual language investments targeted towards program development for disadvantaged
3 children will help to promote both efficiency and educational equity for the children of our state.
4 (8) The expansion of funding for bilingual and dual language programs that advance
5 outcomes for multilingual learners is critical to achieving the state's goal for grade-level reading by
6 the third grade and other academic achievements.
7 SECTION 2. Title 16 of the General Laws entitled "EDUCATION" is hereby amended by
8 adding thereto the following chapter:

32 limited to, the Algonquin Narragansett language.
33 16-54.1-3. SABE act fund authorized.
34 The department of elementary and secondary education (the "department") shall establish

1 a dual language program fund within the department. For purposes of funding this chapter, the
2 general assembly shall appropriate the sum of three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000).

4 language ("DL") pilot program to provide grants to school districts and schools that establish DL
5 programs.

12 consistent with the provisions of 34 CFR § 303.2.

16 thereto.
17 (2) The LEA has a multilingual learner student population exceeding fifteen percent (15%)
18 of the total pupil enrollment per RIDE data.
19 (i) The language(s) of instruction, in addition to English, shall be determined based on the
20 predominant home language(s) of the multilingual learner (MLL) student population.
21 (3) LEAs are encouraged to leverage existing funds including the state share of the MLL
22 funding formula distribution and federal funds.
23 16-54.1-4. Implementation of LEA dual language programs.
24 (a) LEA recipients of the SABE act fund per § 16-54.1-3, shall use funds for dual language

28 staff;
29 (3) Procure high-quality curricular materials to enhance dual language instruction; and
30 (4) Other activities designed to facilitate or promote the LEA’s existing or emerging dual
31 language programs.
32 (b) Develop and commit to an immediate or gradual staffing plan to support the
33 kindergarten through grade twelve (K-12) dual language program; or
34 (c) Only programs that adhere to high quality dual language program standards may be
