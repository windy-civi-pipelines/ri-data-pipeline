EXPLANATION
BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL
OF
A N A C T
RELATING TO LABOR AND LABOR RELATIONS -- MINIMUM WAGES--OVERTIME
***
1 Under current law, employers are not obligated to pay overtime to their executive,
2 administrative, and professional employees who are compensated through salary rather than hourly
3 wages, unless the salary of such employees would, if calculated according to a 40-hour work week,
4 fall below the state’s current minimum wage. This act would raise that cut-off and make additional
5 salaried employees non-exempt and therefore eligible for overtime pay, by requiring small
6 employers with one to fifty (1-50) employees and large employers with fifty (50) or more
7 employees, to pay overtime wages to currently exempt workers, if their salary falls below a
8 threshold based upon multipliers of minimum hourly wage, for a forty (40) hour workweek. For
9 example, for the year 2026, the multiplier would be one and one-half (1½) times the minimum
10 hourly wage for a forty (40) hour workweek for small employers with less than fifty (50) employees
11 and two (2) times the minimum hourly wage for a forty (40) hour workweek for large employers
12 with more than fifty (50) employees, resulting in overtime entitlement for more employees.
13 This act would take effect upon passage.
