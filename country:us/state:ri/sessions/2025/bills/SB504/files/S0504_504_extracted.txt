3 45-23-44. General provisions — Physical design requirements.
4 (a) All local regulations shall specify, through reasonable, objective standards and criteria,
5 all physical design requirements for subdivisions and land-development projects that are to be
6 reviewed and approved pursuant to the regulations. Regulations shall specify all requirements and
7 policies for subdivisions and land-development projects that are not contained in the municipality’s
8 zoning ordinance.
9 (b) Nothing in this section shall be construed to restrict a municipality’s right, within state
10 and local regulations, to establish its own minimum lot size per zoning district in its town or city,
11 except subject to subsection (g) of this section.
12 (c) The slope of land shall not be excluded from the calculation of the buildable lot area or
13 the minimum lot size, or in the calculation of the number of buildable lots or units.
14 (d) Wetland buffers, as defined in § 2-1-20, shall be included in the calculation of a
15 minimum lot area and in the total number of square feet or acres of a tract or parcel of land before
16 calculating the maximum potential number of units or lots for development; provided, however,
17 that this shall not apply to lots directly abutting surface reservoirs with direct withdrawals used for
18 public drinking water. Nothing herein changes the definition and applicability of a “buildable lot”
1 as set forth under § 45-23-60(a)(4); and nothing herein permits the disturbance of wetlands or
2 wetland buffers or otherwise alters the provisions of the freshwater wetlands act, § 2-1-18 et seq.
3 (e) The requirements and policies may include, but are not limited to: requirements and
4 policies for rights-of-way, open space, landscaping, connections of proposed streets and drainage
5 systems with those of the surrounding neighborhood; public access through property to adjacent
6 public property; and the relationship of proposed developments to natural and man-made features
7 of the surrounding neighborhood.
8 (f) The regulations shall specify all necessary findings, formulas for calculations, and
9 procedures for meeting the requirements and policies. These requirements and policies apply to all
10 subdivisions and land development projects reviewed and/or administered under the local
11 regulations.
12 (g) Local regulations shall be modified as needed to meet the purposes of § 45-24-78
13 concerning attached single-family dwellings including, but not limited to, updated physical design
14 requirements concerning minimum lot size, lot width, lot frontage, lot depth requirements, setbacks
15 and street access.
16 (1) In a land development project consisting of attached single-family dwellings, individual
17 lots shall not be required to provide permanent physical access to a public street, regardless of lot
18 frontage; provided that, the development as a whole, shall provide adequate permanent physical
19 access to a public street consistent with local regulations.

5 development of at least fifty percent (50%) of the existing gross floor area into residential units,
6 shall be a permitted use and allowed by specific and objective provisions of a zoning ordinance,
7 except where such is prohibited by environmental land use restrictions recorded on the property by
8 the state of Rhode Island department of environmental management or the United States
9 Environmental Protection Agency preventing the conversion to residential use.
10 (1) The specific zoning ordinance provisions for adaptive reuse shall exempt adaptive reuse
11 developments from off-street parking requirements of over one space per dwelling unit.
12 (2) Density.
13 (i) For projects that meet the following criteria, zoning ordinances shall allow for high
14 density development and shall not limit the density to less than fifteen (15) dwelling units per acre:

27 safety standards.
28 (3) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, for adaptive reuse projects,
29 existing building setbacks shall remain and shall be considered legal nonconforming, but no
30 additional encroachments shall be permitted into any nonconforming setback, unless otherwise
31 allowed by zoning ordinance or relief is granted by the applicable authority.
32 (4) For adaptive reuse projects, notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the
33 height of the existing structure, if it exceeds the maximum height of the zoning district, may remain
34 and shall be considered legal nonconforming, and any rooftop construction shall be included within
LC001475 - Page 12 of 15

10 section within six (6) months of the department of housing publishing model ordinance language
11 pursuant to § 45-24-78(b). In the event that a city or town fails to timely amend its zoning
12 ordinances, attached single-family dwellings shall be permitted in the residential zoning districts
13 of the city or town according to the terms of the model ordinance language.
14 SECTION 3. Chapter 45-24 of the General Laws entitled "Zoning Ordinances" is hereby
15 amended by adding thereto the following section:
16 45-24-78. Attached single-family dwellings.
17 (a) Pursuant to § 45-24-37, attached single-family dwellings shall be allowed by right in
18 residential zoning districts under the following circumstances:
19 (1) The parcel to be developed has access to public sewer and water service or has access
20 to adequate private water, such as a well and/or wastewater treatment system(s) approved by the
21 relevant state agency.
22 (2) The residential density of the development does not exceed the greater of:
23 (i) The maximum density permitted by the comprehensive plan of the city or town for the
24 area in which the parcel is located, irrespective of zoned density; or
25 (ii) The total number of units permitted to be developed on the parcel by local ordinance.
26 If the foregoing criteria are satisfied, each attached single-family dwelling shall be entitled to its
27 own parcel through subdivision regardless of any base zone standards concerning minimum lot
28 size, lot width, lot frontage, or lot depth.
29 (3) Any base zone standards concerning setbacks shall apply relative to the external
30 boundary of a row of attached single-family dwellings rather than to each individual parcel. Any
31 standards concerning permeable surface or lot building coverage shall apply to individual parcels
32 in the form of a percentage, calculated according to what the base zone permits by right for detached
33 single-family dwellings. All other dimensional standards of the base zone shall apply.
34 (4) Cities and towns may establish additional development standards for attached single-
LC001475 - Page 13 of 15
1 family dwellings in local ordinance; provided that, such standards shall not restrict a dwelling to
2 less than three (3) stories, restrict its floor area ratio to less than one, or require more than one off-
3 street parking space. The off-street parking, lot access, or other amenities for an attached single-
4 family dwelling may be provided off-site through a homeowners’ association or other form of
5 common ownership arrangement.
6 (b) To alleviate administrative burdens for cities and towns, the department of housing
7 shall issue a guidance document setting forth model ordinance language on attached single-family
8 dwellings within three (3) months from the effective date of this section.
9 (c) An attached single-family dwelling authorized under this section shall be considered to
10 have satisfied the positive findings required under § 45-23-60(a)(1) and (a)(3).

4 (a) All local regulations shall specify, through reasonable, objective standards and criteria,
5 all physical design requirements for subdivisions and land-development projects that are to be
6 reviewed and approved pursuant to the regulations. Regulations shall specify all requirements and
7 policies for subdivisions and land-development projects that are not contained in the municipality’s
8 zoning ordinance.
9 (b) Nothing in this section shall be construed to restrict a municipality’s right, within state
10 and local regulations, to establish its own minimum lot size per zoning district in its town or city,
11 except subject to subsection (g) of this section.
12 (c) The slope of land shall not be excluded from the calculation of the buildable lot area or
13 the minimum lot size, or in the calculation of the number of buildable lots or units.
14 (d) Wetland buffers, as defined in § 2-1-20, shall be included in the calculation of a
15 minimum lot area and in the total number of square feet or acres of a tract or parcel of land before
16 calculating the maximum potential number of units or lots for development; provided, however,
17 that this shall not apply to lots directly abutting surface reservoirs with direct withdrawals used for
18 public drinking water. Nothing herein changes the definition and applicability of a “buildable lot”

1 as set forth under § 45-23-60(a)(4); and nothing herein permits the disturbance of wetlands or
2 wetland buffers or otherwise alters the provisions of the freshwater wetlands act, § 2-1-18 et seq.
3 (e) The requirements and policies may include, but are not limited to: requirements and
4 policies for rights-of-way, open space, landscaping, connections of proposed streets and drainage
5 systems with those of the surrounding neighborhood; public access through property to adjacent
6 public property; and the relationship of proposed developments to natural and man-made features
7 of the surrounding neighborhood.
8 (f) The regulations shall specify all necessary findings, formulas for calculations, and
9 procedures for meeting the requirements and policies. These requirements and policies apply to all
10 subdivisions and land development projects reviewed and/or administered under the local
11 regulations.
12 (g) Local regulations shall be modified as needed to meet the purposes of § 45-24-78
13 concerning attached single-family dwellings including, but not limited to, updated physical design
14 requirements concerning minimum lot size, lot width, lot frontage, lot depth requirements, setbacks
15 and street access.
16 (1) In a land development project consisting of attached single-family dwellings, individual
17 lots shall not be required to provide permanent physical access to a public street, regardless of lot
18 frontage; provided that, the development as a whole, shall provide adequate permanent physical
19 access to a public street consistent with local regulations.
20 SECTION 2. Sections 45-24-31 and 45-24-37 of the General Laws in Chapter 45-24

34 (a) The zoning ordinance shall provide a listing of all land uses and/or performance
LC001475 - Page 10 of 15

1 standards for uses that are permitted within the zoning use districts of the municipality. The
2 ordinance may provide for a procedure under which a proposed land use that is not specifically
3 listed may be presented by the property owner to the zoning board of review or to a local official
4 or agency charged with administration and enforcement of the ordinance for an evaluation and
5 determination of whether the proposed use is of a similar type, character, and intensity as a listed
6 permitted use. Upon such determination, the proposed use may be considered to be a permitted use.
7 (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the following uses are permitted
8 uses within all residential zoning use districts of a municipality and all industrial and commercial
9 zoning use districts except where residential use is prohibited for public health or safety reasons:
10 (1) Households;
11 (2) Community residences; and
12 (3) Family daycare homes.
13 (c) Any time a building or other structure used for residential purposes, or a portion of a
14 building containing residential units, is rendered uninhabitable by virtue of a casualty such as fire
15 or flood, the owner of the property is allowed to park, temporarily, mobile and manufactured home,
16 or homes, as the need may be, elsewhere upon the land, for use and occupancy of the former
17 occupants for a period of up to twelve (12) months, or until the building or structure is rehabilitated
18 and otherwise made fit for occupancy. The property owner, or a properly designated agent of the
19 owner, is only allowed to cause the mobile and manufactured home, or homes, to remain
20 temporarily upon the land by making timely application to the local building official for the
21 purposes of obtaining the necessary permits to repair or rebuild the structure.
22 (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, appropriate access for people with
23 disabilities to residential structures is allowed as a reasonable accommodation for any person(s)
24 residing, or intending to reside, in the residential structure.
25 (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, an accessory dwelling unit
26 (“ADU”) that meets the requirements of §§ 45-24-31 and 45-24-73(a) shall be a permitted use in
27 all residential zoning districts. An ADU that meets the requirements of §§ 45-24-31 and 45-24-

34 districts, except where prohibited for public health or safety reasons or the protection of wildlife
LC001475 - Page 11 of 15

1 habitat.
2 (h) Adaptive reuse. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, adaptive reuse
3 for the conversion of any commercial building, including offices, schools, religious facilities,
4 medical buildings, and malls into residential units or mixed-use developments which include the
5 development of at least fifty percent (50%) of the existing gross floor area into residential units,
6 shall be a permitted use and allowed by specific and objective provisions of a zoning ordinance,
7 except where such is prohibited by environmental land use restrictions recorded on the property by
8 the state of Rhode Island department of environmental management or the United States
9 Environmental Protection Agency preventing the conversion to residential use.
10 (1) The specific zoning ordinance provisions for adaptive reuse shall exempt adaptive reuse
11 developments from off-street parking requirements of over one space per dwelling unit.
12 (2) Density.
13 (i) For projects that meet the following criteria, zoning ordinances shall allow for high
14 density development and shall not limit the density to less than fifteen (15) dwelling units per acre:
15 (A) Where the project is limited to the existing footprint, except that the footprint is allowed
16 to be expanded to accommodate upgrades related to the building and fire codes and utilities; and
17 (B) The development includes at least twenty percent (20%) low- and moderate-income
18 housing; and
19 (C) The development has access to public sewer and water service or has access to adequate
20 private water, such as a well and and/or wastewater treatment system(s) approved by the relevant
21 state agency for the entire development as applicable.
22 (ii) For all other adaptive reuse projects, the residential density permitted in the converted
23 structure shall be the maximum allowed that otherwise meets all standards of minimum housing
24 and has access to public sewer and water service or has access to adequate private water, such as a
25 well, and wastewater treatment system(s) approved by the relevant state agency for the entire
26 development, as applicable. The density proposed shall be determined to meet all public health and
27 safety standards.
28 (3) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, for adaptive reuse projects,
29 existing building setbacks shall remain and shall be considered legal nonconforming, but no
30 additional encroachments shall be permitted into any nonconforming setback, unless otherwise
31 allowed by zoning ordinance or relief is granted by the applicable authority.
32 (4) For adaptive reuse projects, notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the
33 height of the existing structure, if it exceeds the maximum height of the zoning district, may remain
34 and shall be considered legal nonconforming, and any rooftop construction shall be included within
LC001475 - Page 12 of 15

1 the height exemption.
2 (i) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, all towns and cities may allow
3 manufactured homes that comply with § 23-27.3-109.1.3 as a type of single-family home on any
4 lot zoned for single-family use. Such home shall comply with all dimensional requirements of a
5 single-family home in the district or seek relief for the same under the provisions of this chapter.
6 (j) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, an attached single-family dwelling
7 that meets the requirements of § 45-24-78 shall be a permitted use in all residential zoning districts
8 according to the conditions set forth therein.
9 (1) Each city or town shall amend its zoning ordinances to conform to subsection (j) of this
10 section within six (6) months of the department of housing publishing model ordinance language
11 pursuant to § 45-24-78(b). In the event that a city or town fails to timely amend its zoning
12 ordinances, attached single-family dwellings shall be permitted in the residential zoning districts
13 of the city or town according to the terms of the model ordinance language.
14 SECTION 3. Chapter 45-24 of the General Laws entitled "Zoning Ordinances" is hereby
15 amended by adding thereto the following section:
16 45-24-78. Attached single-family dwellings.
17 (a) Pursuant to § 45-24-37, attached single-family dwellings shall be allowed by right in
18 residential zoning districts under the following circumstances:
19 (1) The parcel to be developed has access to public sewer and water service or has access
20 to adequate private water, such as a well and/or wastewater treatment system(s) approved by the
21 relevant state agency.
22 (2) The residential density of the development does not exceed the greater of:
23 (i) The maximum density permitted by the comprehensive plan of the city or town for the
24 area in which the parcel is located, irrespective of zoned density; or
25 (ii) The total number of units permitted to be developed on the parcel by local ordinance.
26 If the foregoing criteria are satisfied, each attached single-family dwelling shall be entitled to its
27 own parcel through subdivision regardless of any base zone standards concerning minimum lot
28 size, lot width, lot frontage, or lot depth.
29 (3) Any base zone standards concerning setbacks shall apply relative to the external
30 boundary of a row of attached single-family dwellings rather than to each individual parcel. Any
31 standards concerning permeable surface or lot building coverage shall apply to individual parcels
32 in the form of a percentage, calculated according to what the base zone permits by right for detached
33 single-family dwellings. All other dimensional standards of the base zone shall apply.
34 (4) Cities and towns may establish additional development standards for attached single-
LC001475 - Page 13 of 15

1 family dwellings in local ordinance; provided that, such standards shall not restrict a dwelling to
2 less than three (3) stories, restrict its floor area ratio to less than one, or require more than one off-
3 street parking space. The off-street parking, lot access, or other amenities for an attached single-
4 family dwelling may be provided off-site through a homeowners’ association or other form of
5 common ownership arrangement.
6 (b) To alleviate administrative burdens for cities and towns, the department of housing
7 shall issue a guidance document setting forth model ordinance language on attached single-family
8 dwellings within three (3) months from the effective date of this section.
9 (c) An attached single-family dwelling authorized under this section shall be considered to
10 have satisfied the positive findings required under § 45-23-60(a)(1) and (a)(3).
11 SECTION 4. This act shall take effect upon passage.
