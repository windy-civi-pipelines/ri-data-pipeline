26 or any controlled substance, as defined in § 21-28-1.02, shall be administered at the direction of a
27 law enforcement officer having reasonable grounds to believe the person to have been driving a
28 motor vehicle within this state while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, toluene, or any
29 controlled substance, as defined in chapter 28 of title 21, or any combination of these. The director

1 person may file an affidavit with the division of motor vehicles stating the reasons why he or she
2 cannot be required to take blood tests and a notation to this effect shall be made on his or her
3 license. If that person is asked to submit to chemical tests as provided under this chapter, the person
4 shall only be required to submit to chemical tests of his or her breath, saliva or urine. When a person

16 reasonable grounds to believe that the person had been driving a motor vehicle while under the
17 influence of intoxicating liquor, toluene, or any controlled substance as defined in chapter 28 of
18 title 21, or any combination thereof. The magistrate shall also determine if the person had been
19 informed of the penalties incurred as a result of failing to submit to a chemical test as provided in
20 this section and that the person had been informed of the implied consent notice contained in
21 subsection (c)(10) of this section. For the purpose of this subsection only, “driving a motor vehicle
22 while under the influence of any controlled substance as defined in chapter 28 of title 21” shall be
23 indicated by the presence or aroma of a controlled substance on or about the person or vehicle of

26 (2) If the magistrate determines that subsection (b)(1) of this section has been satisfied they
27 shall promptly order that the person’s operator’s license or privilege to operate a motor vehicle in
28 this state be immediately suspended. Said suspension shall be subject to the hardship provisions
29 enumerated in § 31-27-2.8.
30 (c) A traffic tribunal judge or magistrate, or a district court judge or magistrate, pursuant
31 to the terms of subsection (d) of this section, shall order as follows:
32 (1) Impose, for the first violation, a fine in the amount of two hundred dollars ($200) to

23 treatment for the individual. Provided, that prior to the reinstatement of a license to a person charged
24 with a third or subsequent violation within a three-year (3) period, a hearing shall be held before a
25 judge or magistrate. At the hearing, the judge or magistrate shall review the person’s driving record,
26 his or her employment history, family background, and any other pertinent factors that would
27 indicate that the person has demonstrated behavior that warrants the reinstatement of his or her
28 license.
29 (4) For a second violation within a ten-year (10) period with respect to a case of a refusal
30 to submit to a blood test, a fine in the amount of six hundred dollars ($600) to one thousand dollars

11 prior to the reinstatement of a license to a person charged with a third or subsequent violation within
12 a three-year (3) period, a hearing shall be held before a judicial officer. At the hearing, the judicial
13 officer shall review the person’s driving record, his or her employment history, family background,
14 and any other pertinent factors that would indicate that the person has demonstrated behavior that
15 warrants the reinstatement of their license.
16 (6) For purposes of determining the period of license suspension, a prior violation shall
17 constitute any charge brought and sustained under the provisions of this section or § 31-27-2.
18 (7) In addition to any other fines, a highway safety assessment of five hundred dollars
19 ($500) shall be paid by any person found in violation of this section, the assessment to be deposited
20 into the general fund. The assessment provided for by this subsection shall be collected from a
21 violator before any other fines authorized by this section.

30 law requires you to submit to a chemical test of your blood, breath, saliva, or urine for the purpose
31 of determining the chemical content of your body fluids or breath. If you refuse this testing, certain
32 penalties can be imposed and include the following: for a first offense, your Rhode Island driver’s
33 license or privilege to operate a motor vehicle in this state can be suspended for six (6) months to
34 one year or modified to permit operation in connection with an ignition interlock device and/or
LC002635 - Page 29 of 36
1 blood and urine testing for a period specified by law; a fine from two hundred dollars ($200) to five

3 hours of community service and attend a special course on driving while intoxicated or under the
4 influence of a controlled substance and/or alcohol or drug treatment. If you have had one or more
5 previous offenses within the past ten (10) years, your refusal to submit to a chemical test of breath
6 or urine at this time can have criminal penalties, including incarceration up to six (6) months for a
7 second offense and up to one year for a third or subsequent offense, and can carry increased license
8 suspension or ignition interlock and/or blood and urine testing periods, fines, and community
9 service. All violators shall pay a five hundred dollar ($500) highway safety assessment fee, a two
10 hundred dollar ($200) department of health Rhode Island state crime laboratory chemical testing
11 programs assessment fee, and a license reinstatement fee. Refusal to submit to a chemical test of
12 blood shall not subject you to criminal penalties for the refusal itself, but if you have one or more
13 previous offenses other civil penalties may increase. You have the right to be examined at your
14 own expense by a physician selected by you. If you submit to a chemical test at this time, you have
15 the right to have an additional chemical test performed at your own expense. You will be afforded
16 a reasonable opportunity to exercise these rights. Access to a telephone will be made available for
17 you to make those arrangements. You may now use a telephone.”
18 Use of this implied consent notice shall serve as evidence that a person’s consent to a
19 chemical test is valid in a prosecution involving driving under the influence of liquor, controlled
20 substances, and/or drugs.
21 (d) Upon suspending or refusing to issue a license or permit as provided in subsection (a),
22 the traffic tribunal or district court shall immediately notify the person involved in writing, and
23 upon his or her request, within fifteen (15) days, afford the person an opportunity for a hearing as
24 early as practical upon receipt of a request in writing. Upon a hearing, the judge may administer
25 oaths and may issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of relevant books
26 and papers. If the judge finds after the hearing that:
27 (1) The law enforcement officer making the sworn report had reasonable grounds to believe
28 that the arrested person had been driving a motor vehicle within this state while under the influence
29 of intoxicating liquor, toluene, or any controlled substance, as defined in chapter 28 of title 21, or
30 any combination of these;
31 (2) The person, while under arrest, refused to submit to the tests upon the request of a law
32 enforcement officer;
33 (3) The person had been informed of his or her rights in accordance with § 31-27-3; and
34 (4) The person had been informed of the penalties contained in the implied consent notice
LC002635 - Page 30 of 36
1 set forth in subsection (c)(10) of this section, the judge shall sustain the violation. The judge shall
2 then impose the penalties set forth in subsection (c) of this section. Action by the judge must be
3 taken within seven (7) days after the hearing or it shall be presumed that the judge has refused to
4 issue his or her order of suspension.
5 (e) For the purposes of this section, any test of a sample of blood, breath, or urine for the
6 presence of alcohol that relies, in whole or in part, upon the principle of infrared light absorption is
7 considered a chemical test.
8 (f) If any provision of this section, or the application of any provision, shall, for any reason,
9 be judged invalid, the judgment shall not affect, impair, or invalidate the remainder of the section,
10 but shall be confined in this effect to the provisions or application directly involved in the
11 controversy giving rise to the judgment.
12 31-27-2.3. Revocation of license upon refusal to submit to preliminary breath test.
13 (a) When a law enforcement officer has reason to believe that a person is driving or in
14 actual physical control of any motor vehicle in this state while under the influence of alcohol, the
15 law enforcement officer may require the person to submit to a preliminary breath analysis for the
16 purpose of determining the person’s blood alcohol content. The breath analysis must be
17 administered immediately upon the law enforcement officer’s formulation of a reasonable belief
18 that the person is driving or in actual control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
19 or immediately upon the stop of the person, whichever is later in time. Any chemical breath analysis
20 required under this section must be administered with a device and in a manner approved by the
21 director of the department of health Rhode Island state crime laboratory for that purpose. The result
22 of a preliminary chemical breath analysis may be used for the purpose of guiding the officer in
23 deciding whether an arrest should be made. When a driver is arrested following a preliminary breath
24 analysis, tests may be taken pursuant to § 31-27-2.1. The results of a preliminary breath test may
25 not be used as evidence in any administrative or court proceeding involving driving while
26 intoxicated or refusing to take a breathalyzer test, except as evidence of probable cause in making
27 the initial arrest.
28 (b) If a person refuses, upon a lawful request of a law enforcement officer, to submit to a
29 test under subsection (a) of this section, that person shall be guilty of an infraction and shall be
30 subject to the penalty provided in § 31-41.1-4. However, it shall be a defense to a charge of refusing
31 a validly requested preliminary breath analysis that the medical condition of a person precluded the
32 giving of any such test.
33 31-27-2.5. Chemical tests to persons under eighteen (18) years of age — Refusal —
34 License suspension.
LC002635 - Page 31 of 36

6 (c) If a person as set forth in subsection (a) of this section refuses, upon the request of a
7 law enforcement officer, to submit to a test as provided in § 31-27-2.1, none shall be given, but a
8 judge of the family court, upon receipt of a report or testimony of a law enforcement officer: that
9 he or she had probable cause to stop the arrested person and reasonable grounds to believe the
10 arrested person had been driving a motor vehicle within this state while impaired by intoxicating
11 liquor, toluene, or any controlled substance, as defined in chapter 28 of title 21, or any combination
12 of these; that the person had been informed of his or her rights in accordance with § 31-27-3; that
13 the person had been informed of the implied consent notice contained in subsection (h) of this
14 section; and that the person had refused to submit to the test upon the request of a law enforcement
15 officer; shall promptly order a hearing on whether the person’s operator’s license or privilege to
16 operate a motor vehicle in this state shall be suspended. Upon suspension, the judge shall order the
17 license of the person to be surrendered to the department of administration, division of motor
18 vehicles, within three (3) days.
19 (d) If the person takes a test, as provided in § 31-27-2 and the test determines the person’s
20 blood alcohol concentration to be at least two-hundredths of one percent (.02%) but less than one-
21 tenth of one percent (.1%) by weight, the person shall be determined to have been driving while
22 impaired. A judge of the family court shall, pursuant to the terms of subsection (e) of this section,
23 order as follows:
24 (1) A highway safety assessment of one hundred fifty dollars ($150), or community
25 restitution in lieu of highway safety assessment shall be paid by any person found in violation of
26 this section. The assessment shall be deposited into the general fund.

29 attend a special course on driving while intoxicated and provided that the person shall also attend
30 an alcohol and/or drug treatment program if ordered by the family court judge. Failure or refusal
31 of the person to attend the course and/or alcohol or drug treatment program shall result in the
32 person’s driving license being suspended until the course or treatment program has been completed.
33 (3) On a second violation of this section, the person’s driving license shall be suspended
34 until he or she is twenty-one (21) years of age. The sentencing judge shall require alcohol and/or
LC002635 - Page 32 of 36
1 drug treatment for the individual.

3 an additional period of two (2) years and the sentencing judge shall require alcohol and/or drug
4 treatment for the individual.
5 (5) No suspensions, assessments, driving while intoxicated school, or alcohol and/or drug
6 treatment programs under this section can be suspended, shortened, altered, or changed.

10 (f) The police department which charges any person under eighteen (18) years of age with
11 refusal to submit to a chemical test, driving while impaired by intoxicating liquors or drugs, or
12 driving while under the influence of liquor or drugs, shall ascertain the name and address of the

19 “Rhode Island law requires you to submit to a chemical test of your blood, breath, or urine
20 for the purpose of determining the chemical content of your body fluids or breath. If you refuse this
21 testing, certain penalties can be imposed. These penalties include the following: your Rhode Island

23 months or modified to permit operation in connection with an ignition interlock device for a period
24 specified by law; a fine from two hundred dollars ($200) to five hundred dollars ($500) can be
25 imposed; and you can be ordered to perform ten (10) to sixty (60) hours of community service and
26 attend a special course on driving while intoxicated or under the influence of a controlled substance
27 and/or alcohol or drug treatment. If you have had one or more previous offenses within the past
28 five (5) years, your loss or modification of license, fine, and community service sanctions can
29 increase over those provided for a first offense. All violators shall pay a five hundred dollar ($500)
30 highway safety assessment fee, a two hundred dollar ($200) department of health Rhode Island
31 state crime laboratory chemical testing programs fee, and a license reinstatement fee. If you refuse
32 to submit to a chemical test, you will be required to maintain proof of financial responsibility for

LC002635 - Page 33 of 36
1 to a chemical test at this time, you have the right to have an additional chemical test performed at
2 your own expense. You will be afforded a reasonable opportunity to exercise these rights. Access
3 to a telephone will be made available for you to make those arrangements. You may now use the
4 telephone.”

6 chemical test is valid in a trial for driving under the influence of liquor, controlled substances,
7 and/or drugs.
8 31-27-2.9. Administration of chemical test.
9 (a) Notwithstanding any provision of § 31-27-2.1, if an individual refuses to consent to a
10 chemical test as provided in § 31-27-2.1, and a peace officer, as defined in § 12-7-21, has probable

13 influence of any intoxicating liquor, toluene or any controlled substance as defined in chapter 21-
14 28, or any combination thereof, a chemical test may be administered without the consent of that
15 individual provided that the peace officer first obtains a search warrant authorizing administration
16 of the chemical test. The chemical test shall determine the amount of the alcohol or the presence of
17 a controlled substance in that person’s blood, saliva or breath.
18 (b) The chemical test shall be administered in accordance with the methods approved by
19 the director of the department of health Rhode Island state crime laboratory as provided for in
20 subdivision 31-27-2(c)(4). The individual shall be afforded the opportunity to have an additional
21 chemical test as established in subdivision 31-27-2(c)(6).
22 (c) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, including, but not limited to, chapter 5-
23 37.3, any health care provider who, as authorized by the search warrant in subsection (a):
24 (i) Takes a blood, saliva or breath sample from an individual; or
25 (ii) Performs the chemical test; or
26 (iii) Provides information to a peace officer pursuant to subsection (a) above and who uses
27 reasonable care and accepted medical practices shall not be liable in any civil or criminal
28 proceeding arising from the taking of the sample, from the performance of the chemical test or from
29 the disclosure or release of the test results.
30 (d) The results of a chemical test performed pursuant to this section shall be admissible as
31 competent evidence in any civil or criminal prosecution provided that evidence is presented in
32 compliance with the conditions set forth in subdivisions 31-27-2(c)(3), 31-27-2(c)(4) and 31-27-
33 2(c)(6).

15 recognition expert or evaluator, certified pursuant to training approved by the Rhode Island
16 department of transportation office on highway safety. Proof of guilt under this section may also

18 toluene, or any controlled substance defined in chapter 28 of title 21, or any combination of these,
19 to a degree that rendered the person incapable of safely operating a vehicle. The fact that any person
20 charged with violating this section is, or has been, legally entitled to use alcohol or a drug shall not
21 constitute a defense against any charge of violating this section.

25 any combination of these, in the defendant’s blood at the time alleged as shown by a chemical
26 analysis of the defendant’s breath, blood, saliva or urine or other bodily substance, shall be
27 admissible and competent, provided that evidence is presented that the following conditions have
28 been complied with:
29 (1) The defendant has consented to the taking of the test upon which the analysis is made.
30 Evidence that the defendant had refused to submit to the test shall not be admissible unless the
31 defendant elects to testify.

22 (a) Any person who operates a motor vehicle within this state shall be deemed to have
23 given his or her consent to chemical tests of his or her breath, blood, saliva and/or urine for the

25 (2) complete tests, one for the presence of intoxicating liquor and one for the presence of toluene
26 or any controlled substance, as defined in § 21-28-1.02, shall be administered at the direction of a
27 law enforcement officer having reasonable grounds to believe the person to have been driving a
28 motor vehicle within this state while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, toluene, or any
29 controlled substance, as defined in chapter 28 of title 21, or any combination of these. The director
30 of the department of health Rhode Island state crime laboratory is empowered to make and file,

16 reasonable grounds to believe that the person had been driving a motor vehicle while under the
17 influence of intoxicating liquor, toluene, or any controlled substance as defined in chapter 28 of
18 title 21, or any combination thereof. The magistrate shall also determine if the person had been
19 informed of the penalties incurred as a result of failing to submit to a chemical test as provided in
20 this section and that the person had been informed of the implied consent notice contained in
21 subsection (c)(10) of this section. For the purpose of this subsection only, “driving a motor vehicle
22 while under the influence of any controlled substance as defined in chapter 28 of title 21” shall be

23 treatment for the individual. Provided, that prior to the reinstatement of a license to a person charged
24 with a third or subsequent violation within a three-year (3) period, a hearing shall be held before a
25 judge or magistrate. At the hearing, the judge or magistrate shall review the person’s driving record,
26 his or her employment history, family background, and any other pertinent factors that would
27 indicate that the person has demonstrated behavior that warrants the reinstatement of his or her
28 license.
29 (4) For a second violation within a ten-year (10) period with respect to a case of a refusal
30 to submit to a blood test, a fine in the amount of six hundred dollars ($600) to one thousand dollars
31 ($1,000); the person shall perform sixty (60) to one hundred (100) hours of public community
32 restitution; and the person’s driving license in this state shall be suspended for a period of two (2)

LC002635 - Page 28 of 36

1 equipped with an ignition interlock system as provided in § 31-27-2.8. Such a violation with respect
2 to refusal to submit to a chemical blood test shall be a civil offense.
3 (5) For a third or subsequent violation within a ten-year (10) period with respect to a case
4 of a refusal to submit to a blood test, a fine in the amount of eight hundred dollars ($800) to one
5 thousand dollars ($1,000); the person shall perform not less than one hundred (100) hours of public
6 community restitution; and the person’s driving license in this state shall be suspended for a period
7 of two (2) to five (5) years. The sentencing judicial officer shall prohibit that person from operating
8 a motor vehicle that is not equipped with an ignition interlock system as provided in § 31-27-2.8.
9 The judicial officer shall require alcohol and/or drug treatment for the individual. Such a violation
10 with respect to refusal to submit to a chemical test of blood shall be a civil offense. Provided, that
11 prior to the reinstatement of a license to a person charged with a third or subsequent violation within
12 a three-year (3) period, a hearing shall be held before a judicial officer. At the hearing, the judicial
13 officer shall review the person’s driving record, his or her employment history, family background,
14 and any other pertinent factors that would indicate that the person has demonstrated behavior that
15 warrants the reinstatement of their license.
16 (6) For purposes of determining the period of license suspension, a prior violation shall
17 constitute any charge brought and sustained under the provisions of this section or § 31-27-2.
18 (7) In addition to any other fines, a highway safety assessment of five hundred dollars
19 ($500) shall be paid by any person found in violation of this section, the assessment to be deposited
20 into the general fund. The assessment provided for by this subsection shall be collected from a
21 violator before any other fines authorized by this section.
22 (8) In addition to any other fines and highway safety assessments, a two-hundred-dollar
23 ($200) assessment shall be paid by any person found in violation of this section to support the
24 department of health's Rhode Island state crime laboratory's chemical testing programs outlined in
25 §§ 31-27-2(f) and 31-27-2(g), that shall be deposited as general revenues, not restricted receipts.
26 (9) No fines, suspensions, assessments, alcohol or drug treatment programs, course on
27 driving while intoxicated or under the influence of a controlled substance, or public community
28 restitution provided for under this section can be suspended.
29 (10) Implied consent notice for persons eighteen (18) years of age or older: “Rhode Island
30 law requires you to submit to a chemical test of your blood, breath, saliva, or urine for the purpose
31 of determining the chemical content of your body fluids or breath. If you refuse this testing, certain
32 penalties can be imposed and include the following: for a first offense, your Rhode Island driver’s
33 license or privilege to operate a motor vehicle in this state can be suspended for six (6) months to
34 one year or modified to permit operation in connection with an ignition interlock device and/or
LC002635 - Page 29 of 36

1 blood and urine testing for a period specified by law; a fine from two hundred dollars ($200) to five
2 hundred dollars ($500) can be imposed; and you can be ordered to perform ten (10) to sixty (60)
3 hours of community service and attend a special course on driving while intoxicated or under the
4 influence of a controlled substance and/or alcohol or drug treatment. If you have had one or more
5 previous offenses within the past ten (10) years, your refusal to submit to a chemical test of breath
6 or urine at this time can have criminal penalties, including incarceration up to six (6) months for a
7 second offense and up to one year for a third or subsequent offense, and can carry increased license
8 suspension or ignition interlock and/or blood and urine testing periods, fines, and community
9 service. All violators shall pay a five hundred dollar ($500) highway safety assessment fee, a two
10 hundred dollar ($200) department of health Rhode Island state crime laboratory chemical testing
11 programs assessment fee, and a license reinstatement fee. Refusal to submit to a chemical test of
12 blood shall not subject you to criminal penalties for the refusal itself, but if you have one or more
13 previous offenses other civil penalties may increase. You have the right to be examined at your
14 own expense by a physician selected by you. If you submit to a chemical test at this time, you have
15 the right to have an additional chemical test performed at your own expense. You will be afforded
16 a reasonable opportunity to exercise these rights. Access to a telephone will be made available for
17 you to make those arrangements. You may now use a telephone.”
18 Use of this implied consent notice shall serve as evidence that a person’s consent to a
19 chemical test is valid in a prosecution involving driving under the influence of liquor, controlled
20 substances, and/or drugs.
21 (d) Upon suspending or refusing to issue a license or permit as provided in subsection (a),
22 the traffic tribunal or district court shall immediately notify the person involved in writing, and
23 upon his or her request, within fifteen (15) days, afford the person an opportunity for a hearing as
24 early as practical upon receipt of a request in writing. Upon a hearing, the judge may administer
25 oaths and may issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of relevant books
26 and papers. If the judge finds after the hearing that:
27 (1) The law enforcement officer making the sworn report had reasonable grounds to believe
28 that the arrested person had been driving a motor vehicle within this state while under the influence
29 of intoxicating liquor, toluene, or any controlled substance, as defined in chapter 28 of title 21, or
30 any combination of these;
31 (2) The person, while under arrest, refused to submit to the tests upon the request of a law
32 enforcement officer;
33 (3) The person had been informed of his or her rights in accordance with § 31-27-3; and
34 (4) The person had been informed of the penalties contained in the implied consent notice
LC002635 - Page 30 of 36

1 set forth in subsection (c)(10) of this section, the judge shall sustain the violation. The judge shall
2 then impose the penalties set forth in subsection (c) of this section. Action by the judge must be
3 taken within seven (7) days after the hearing or it shall be presumed that the judge has refused to
4 issue his or her order of suspension.
5 (e) For the purposes of this section, any test of a sample of blood, breath, or urine for the
6 presence of alcohol that relies, in whole or in part, upon the principle of infrared light absorption is
7 considered a chemical test.
8 (f) If any provision of this section, or the application of any provision, shall, for any reason,
9 be judged invalid, the judgment shall not affect, impair, or invalidate the remainder of the section,
10 but shall be confined in this effect to the provisions or application directly involved in the
11 controversy giving rise to the judgment.
12 31-27-2.3. Revocation of license upon refusal to submit to preliminary breath test.
13 (a) When a law enforcement officer has reason to believe that a person is driving or in
14 actual physical control of any motor vehicle in this state while under the influence of alcohol, the
15 law enforcement officer may require the person to submit to a preliminary breath analysis for the
16 purpose of determining the person’s blood alcohol content. The breath analysis must be
17 administered immediately upon the law enforcement officer’s formulation of a reasonable belief
18 that the person is driving or in actual control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
19 or immediately upon the stop of the person, whichever is later in time. Any chemical breath analysis
20 required under this section must be administered with a device and in a manner approved by the
21 director of the department of health Rhode Island state crime laboratory for that purpose. The result
22 of a preliminary chemical breath analysis may be used for the purpose of guiding the officer in
23 deciding whether an arrest should be made. When a driver is arrested following a preliminary breath
24 analysis, tests may be taken pursuant to § 31-27-2.1. The results of a preliminary breath test may
25 not be used as evidence in any administrative or court proceeding involving driving while
26 intoxicated or refusing to take a breathalyzer test, except as evidence of probable cause in making
27 the initial arrest.
28 (b) If a person refuses, upon a lawful request of a law enforcement officer, to submit to a
29 test under subsection (a) of this section, that person shall be guilty of an infraction and shall be
30 subject to the penalty provided in § 31-41.1-4. However, it shall be a defense to a charge of refusing
31 a validly requested preliminary breath analysis that the medical condition of a person precluded the
32 giving of any such test.
33 31-27-2.5. Chemical tests to persons under eighteen (18) years of age — Refusal —
34 License suspension.
LC002635 - Page 31 of 36

1 (a) Any person under eighteen (18) years of age who shall refuse to submit to a chemical
2 test as provided in § 31-27-2 shall have imposed all the penalties provided by § 31-27-2.1, but shall
3 have his or her license suspended on a first violation for six (6) months, subject to the terms of
4 subsection (e) of this section.
5 (b) Jurisdiction for violations of this section is given to the family court.
6 (c) If a person as set forth in subsection (a) of this section refuses, upon the request of a
7 law enforcement officer, to submit to a test as provided in § 31-27-2.1, none shall be given, but a
8 judge of the family court, upon receipt of a report or testimony of a law enforcement officer: that
9 he or she had probable cause to stop the arrested person and reasonable grounds to believe the
10 arrested person had been driving a motor vehicle within this state while impaired by intoxicating
11 liquor, toluene, or any controlled substance, as defined in chapter 28 of title 21, or any combination
12 of these; that the person had been informed of his or her rights in accordance with § 31-27-3; that
13 the person had been informed of the implied consent notice contained in subsection (h) of this
14 section; and that the person had refused to submit to the test upon the request of a law enforcement
15 officer; shall promptly order a hearing on whether the person’s operator’s license or privilege to
16 operate a motor vehicle in this state shall be suspended. Upon suspension, the judge shall order the
17 license of the person to be surrendered to the department of administration, division of motor
18 vehicles, within three (3) days.
19 (d) If the person takes a test, as provided in § 31-27-2 and the test determines the person’s
20 blood alcohol concentration to be at least two-hundredths of one percent (.02%) but less than one-
21 tenth of one percent (.1%) by weight, the person shall be determined to have been driving while
22 impaired. A judge of the family court shall, pursuant to the terms of subsection (e) of this section,
23 order as follows:
24 (1) A highway safety assessment of one hundred fifty dollars ($150), or community
25 restitution in lieu of highway safety assessment shall be paid by any person found in violation of
26 this section. The assessment shall be deposited into the general fund.
27 (2) The person’s driving license shall be suspended for six (6) months on a first violation,
28 and may be suspended for a period of up to twelve (12) months, provided the person also shall
29 attend a special course on driving while intoxicated and provided that the person shall also attend
30 an alcohol and/or drug treatment program if ordered by the family court judge. Failure or refusal
31 of the person to attend the course and/or alcohol or drug treatment program shall result in the
32 person’s driving license being suspended until the course or treatment program has been completed.
33 (3) On a second violation of this section, the person’s driving license shall be suspended
34 until he or she is twenty-one (21) years of age. The sentencing judge shall require alcohol and/or
LC002635 - Page 32 of 36

1 drug treatment for the individual.
2 (4) On a third or subsequent violation, the person’s driving license shall be suspended for
3 an additional period of two (2) years and the sentencing judge shall require alcohol and/or drug
4 treatment for the individual.
5 (5) No suspensions, assessments, driving while intoxicated school, or alcohol and/or drug
6 treatment programs under this section can be suspended, shortened, altered, or changed.
7 (e) Upon suspending a license or permit as provided in subsection (a), (c), or (d) of this
8 section, the family court shall immediately notify the person involved, in writing, as well as the
9 custodial parent if the person is under the age of eighteen (18) years.
10 (f) The police department which charges any person under eighteen (18) years of age with
11 refusal to submit to a chemical test, driving while impaired by intoxicating liquors or drugs, or
12 driving while under the influence of liquor or drugs, shall ascertain the name and address of the
13 custodial parent of the person and shall notify the parent in writing within ten (10) days of the
14 charge.
15 (g) The department of administration, upon issuing a first license to a person sixteen (16)
16 or seventeen (17) years of age, shall provide a written notice of the penalties provided by this
17 section. Any violation of this section shall not be considered a criminal offense.
18 (h) Implied consent notice for persons under eighteen (18) years of age:
19 “Rhode Island law requires you to submit to a chemical test of your blood, breath, or urine
20 for the purpose of determining the chemical content of your body fluids or breath. If you refuse this
21 testing, certain penalties can be imposed. These penalties include the following: your Rhode Island
22 driver’s license or privilege to operate a motor vehicle in this state can be suspended for six (6)
23 months or modified to permit operation in connection with an ignition interlock device for a period
24 specified by law; a fine from two hundred dollars ($200) to five hundred dollars ($500) can be
25 imposed; and you can be ordered to perform ten (10) to sixty (60) hours of community service and
26 attend a special course on driving while intoxicated or under the influence of a controlled substance
27 and/or alcohol or drug treatment. If you have had one or more previous offenses within the past
28 five (5) years, your loss or modification of license, fine, and community service sanctions can
29 increase over those provided for a first offense. All violators shall pay a five hundred dollar ($500)
30 highway safety assessment fee, a two hundred dollar ($200) department of health Rhode Island
31 state crime laboratory chemical testing programs fee, and a license reinstatement fee. If you refuse
32 to submit to a chemical test, you will be required to maintain proof of financial responsibility for
33 three (3) years. Refusal to submit to a chemical test shall not be considered a criminal offense. You
34 have the right to be examined at your own expense by a physician selected by you. If you submit
LC002635 - Page 33 of 36

1 to a chemical test at this time, you have the right to have an additional chemical test performed at
2 your own expense. You will be afforded a reasonable opportunity to exercise these rights. Access
3 to a telephone will be made available for you to make those arrangements. You may now use the
4 telephone.”
5 Use of this implied consent notice shall serve as evidence that a person’s consent to a
6 chemical test is valid in a trial for driving under the influence of liquor, controlled substances,
7 and/or drugs.
8 31-27-2.9. Administration of chemical test.
9 (a) Notwithstanding any provision of § 31-27-2.1, if an individual refuses to consent to a
10 chemical test as provided in § 31-27-2.1, and a peace officer, as defined in § 12-7-21, has probable
11 cause to believe that the individual has violated one or more of the following sections: 31-27-1, 31-
12 27-1.1, 31-27-2.2, or 31-27-2.6 and that the individual was operating a motor vehicle under the
13 influence of any intoxicating liquor, toluene or any controlled substance as defined in chapter 21-
14 28, or any combination thereof, a chemical test may be administered without the consent of that
15 individual provided that the peace officer first obtains a search warrant authorizing administration
16 of the chemical test. The chemical test shall determine the amount of the alcohol or the presence of
17 a controlled substance in that person’s blood, saliva or breath.
18 (b) The chemical test shall be administered in accordance with the methods approved by
19 the director of the department of health Rhode Island state crime laboratory as provided for in
20 subdivision 31-27-2(c)(4). The individual shall be afforded the opportunity to have an additional
21 chemical test as established in subdivision 31-27-2(c)(6).
22 (c) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, including, but not limited to, chapter 5-
23 37.3, any health care provider who, as authorized by the search warrant in subsection (a):
24 (i) Takes a blood, saliva or breath sample from an individual; or
25 (ii) Performs the chemical test; or
26 (iii) Provides information to a peace officer pursuant to subsection (a) above and who uses
27 reasonable care and accepted medical practices shall not be liable in any civil or criminal
28 proceeding arising from the taking of the sample, from the performance of the chemical test or from
29 the disclosure or release of the test results.
30 (d) The results of a chemical test performed pursuant to this section shall be admissible as
31 competent evidence in any civil or criminal prosecution provided that evidence is presented in
32 compliance with the conditions set forth in subdivisions 31-27-2(c)(3), 31-27-2(c)(4) and 31-27-
33 2(c)(6).
34 (e) All chemical tests administered pursuant to this section shall be audio and video
LC002635 - Page 34 of 36

1 recorded by the law enforcement agency which applied for and was granted the search warrant
2 authorizing the administration of the chemical test.
3 SECTION 8. Section 21-28-4.21 of the General Laws in Chapter 21-28 entitled "Uniform
4 Controlled Substances Act" is hereby amended to read as follows:
5 21-28-4.21. Drug testing required.
6 Every person who shall be placed on probation for a violation of any section in this chapter
7 prohibiting the unlawful sale, distribution, manufacture, delivery or possession with intent to
8 manufacture, sell, distribute or deliver any controlled substance as classified in schedule I or II or
9 possession of a controlled substance as classified in schedule I or II shall, as a condition of the
10 probation, be required to at his or her own expense submit to drug testing in accordance with the
11 standards and procedures of the department of health Rhode Island state crime laboratory not less
12 than once per month.
13 SECTION 9. This act shall take effect upon passage.
