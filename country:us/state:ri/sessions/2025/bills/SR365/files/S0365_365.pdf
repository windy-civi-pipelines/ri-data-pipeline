PROCLAIMING FEBRUARY 21, 2025, TO BE "NATIONAL CAREGIVERS DAY" IN THE
STATE OF RHODE ISLAND
Introduced By: Senator Hanna M. Gallo
Date Introduced: February 24, 2025
Referred To: Placed on the Senate Consent Calendar
1 WHEREAS, National Caregivers Day was created in 2015, and first celebrated in 2016,
2 by the Providers Association for Home Health & Hospice Agencies (PAHHHA) as a way to
3 recognize and thank the millions of caregivers who go the extra mile every day to provide
4 critically important and nurturing care to millions of Americans; and
5 WHEREAS, According to a 2020 report from the National Alliance for Caregiving and
6 the American Association of Retired Persons, approximately 53 million caregivers in the United
7 States cared for an adult or child without pay. Most caregivers take care of one adult, but
8 approximately fifteen percent care for two adults, and three percent care for three or more adults.
9 The Institute on Aging reports that more than seventy-five percent of caregivers are female; and
10 WHEREAS, The Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index also reports that caregivers spend
11 an average of six days in a month grooming, feeding, dressing, bathing, and walking the people
12 they take care of, thirteen days a month commuting, cleaning, doing laundry, monitoring
13 medication, shopping and cooking special meals for their patients, and a further thirteen hours a
14 month coordinating visits with physicians, researching symptoms and diseases, and managing
15 finances; and
16 WHEREAS, Each year, National Caregivers Day offers an opportunity to thank and show
17 appreciation to our local caregivers, including professional caregivers such as home health aides,
18 nurses, and therapists, as well as informal family caregivers, who provide critically needed and
19 loving care to so many people within our communities. Our communities are truly blessed to have

1 these hard-working and dedicated professionals serving our neighborhoods and taking care of our
2 loved ones and those in need of daily care and assistance; now, therefore be it
3 RESOLVED, That this Senate of the State of Rhode Island hereby proclaims February
4 21, 2025, to be "National Caregivers Day" in the State of Rhode Island; and be it further
5 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
6 transmit a duly certified copy of this resolution to Providers Association for Home Health &
7 Hospice Agencies (PAHHHA).
