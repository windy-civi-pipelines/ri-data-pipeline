14 preceding the assessment on the kinds of insurance in the account. The additional assessments shall
15 be considered loans by and between the separate accounts. Amounts borrowed under this
16 subsection shall be paid back to the separate accounts from which they were borrowed, out of
17 assets, including, but not limited to, existing and future assessments in the account receiving the
18 loan. An interest charge shall be levied on all amounts borrowed under this subsection based on the
19 average prime rate of interest for each year the money remains unpaid. If the amounts borrowed
20 remain unpaid on the seventh yearly anniversary as a result of the inability of the borrowing account
21 to make repayment, then the amount borrowed and interest which is not repaid, starting with the
22 principal and interest of the first year, shall be considered uncollectible. The funds available shall
23 be prorated and the unpaid portion shall be paid as soon after this as funds become available. The
24 association may exempt or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of any member insurer if the
25 assessment would cause the member insurer’s financial statement to reflect amounts of capital or
26 surplus less than the minimum amounts required for a certificate of authority by any jurisdiction in
27 which the member insurer is authorized to transact insurance. However, during the period of
28 deferment, no dividends shall be paid to shareholders or policyholders. Deferred assessments shall
29 be paid when the payment will not reduce capital or surplus below required minimums. Payments
30 shall be refunded to those companies receiving larger assessments by virtue of the deferment, or,
31 at the election of any company, credited against future assessments;
32 (4) Investigate claims brought against the association and adjust, compromise, settle, and
33 pay covered claims to the extent of the association’s obligation and deny all other claims. The
34 association shall pay claims in any order that it may deem reasonable, including the payment of
LC001767/SUB A - Page 12 of 17
1 claims as they are received from the claimants or in groups or categories of claims. The association
2 shall have the right to appoint and to direct legal counsel retained under liability insurance policies
3 for the defense of covered claims and to appoint and direct other service providers for covered
4 services;
5 (5) Notify claimants in this state as deemed necessary by the commissioner and upon the
6 commissioner’s request, to the extent records are available to the association;
7 (6)(i) Have the right to review and contest as set forth in this subsection settlements,
8 releases, compromises, waivers, and judgments to which the insolvent insurer or its insureds were
9 parties prior to the entry of the order of liquidation. In an action to enforce settlements, releases,
10 and judgments to which the insolvent insurer or its insureds were parties prior to the entry of the
11 order of liquidation, the association shall have the right to assert the following defenses, in addition
12 to the defenses available to the insurer:
13 (A) The association is not bound by a settlement, release, compromise, or waiver executed
14 by an insured or the insurer, or any judgment entered against an insured or the insurer by consent
15 or through a failure to exhaust all appeals, if the settlement, release, compromise, waiver, or
16 judgment was:
17 (I) Executed or entered into within one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the entry of an
18 order of liquidation, and the insured or the insurer did not use reasonable care in entering into the
19 settlement, release, compromise, waiver, or judgment, or did not pursue all reasonable appeals of
20 an adverse judgment; or
21 (II) Executed by or taken against an insured or the insurer based on default, fraud, collusion,
22 or the insurer’s failure to defend.
23 (B) If a court of competent jurisdiction finds that the association is not bound by a
24 settlement, release, compromise, waiver, or judgment for the reasons described in subparagraph
25 (i)(A), the settlement, release, compromise, waiver, or judgment shall be set aside, and the
26 association shall be permitted to defend any covered claim on the merits. The settlement, release,
27 compromise, waiver, or judgment may not be considered as evidence of liability or damages in
28 connection with any claim brought against the association or any other party under this chapter.
29 (C) The association shall have the right to assert any statutory defenses or rights of offset
30 against any settlement, release, compromise, or waiver executed by an insured or the insurer, or
31 any judgment taken against the insured or the insurer.
32 (ii) As to any covered claims arising from a judgment under any decision, verdict, or
33 finding based on the default of the insolvent insurer or its failure to defend, the association, either
34 on its own behalf or on behalf of an insured, may apply to have the judgment, order, decision,
LC001767/SUB A - Page 13 of 17
1 verdict, or finding set aside by the same court or administrator that entered the judgment, order,
2 decision, verdict, or finding and shall be permitted to defend the claim on the merits;
3 (7) Handle claims through its employees or through one or more insurers or other persons
4 designated as servicing facilities. Designation of a servicing facility is subject to the approval of
5 the commissioner, but the designation may be declined by a member insurer;
6 (8) Reimburse each servicing facility for obligations of the association paid by the facility
7 and for expenses incurred by the facility while handling claims on behalf of the association and
8 shall pay the other expenses of the association authorized by this chapter;
9 (9)(i) The association shall obtain a line of credit for the benefit of each account, in an
10 amount not to exceed the applicable maximum to ensure the immediate availability of funds for
11 purposes of future claims and expenses attributable to an insurer insolvency in that account. The
12 line of credit shall be obtained from qualified financial institutions. The line of credit shall provide
13 for a thirty-day (30) notice of termination or nonrenewal to the commissioner and the association
14 and shall provide funding to the association within three (3) business days of receipt of written
15 notice from the commissioner of an insolvent insurer in that account. Each member insurer upon
16 receipt of notice from the association shall make immediate payment for its proportionate share of
17 the amount borrowed based on the premium for the preceding calendar year. The maximum line of
18 credit or preinsolvency assessment for each account shall be subject to prior review and approval
19 by the commissioner at the time of origination.
20 (ii) If the association cannot obtain a line of credit, the association may obtain an
21 irrevocable line of credit agreement from each member insurer in an amount not to exceed the
22 member insurer’s maximum assessment pursuant to subdivision (a)(3) to ensure the immediate
23 availability of funds for the purposes of future claims and expenses attributable to an insurer
24 insolvency.
25 Any amount drawn under any line of credit shall be considered a payment toward the
26 member insurer’s assessment provided for in subdivision (a)(3).
27 The member insurer shall provide funding to the association under the line of credit within
28 three (3) business days of receipt of a written request from the association for a draw-down under
29 the line of credit.
30 The line of credit agreement shall be subject to prior review and approval by the
31 commissioner at the time of origination and any subsequent renewal. It shall include any
32 commercially reasonable provisions the association or the commissioner may deem advisable,
33 including a provision that the line of credit is irrevocable or for a stated period of time and provides
34 for thirty-day (30) notice to the association and the commissioner that the line is being terminated
LC001767/SUB A - Page 14 of 17
1 or not renewed.
2 (iii) If a line of credit is not given as provided for in this section, the member insurer shall
3 be responsible for the payment of an assessment of up to the member’s proportionate share of the
4 applicable maximum as set forth in this subsection which shall be paid into a pre-insolvency
5 assessment fund in each account;
6 (10) Submit, not later than ninety (90) days after the end of the association’s fiscal year, a
7 financial report for the preceding fiscal year in a form approved by the commissioner.
8 (b) The association may:
9 (1) Employ or retain persons as are necessary to handle claims and perform other duties of
10 the association;
11 (2) Borrow funds necessary to effect the purposes of this chapter in accordance with the
12 plan of operation;
13 (3) Sue or be sued;
14 (4) Negotiate and become a party to any contracts necessary to carry out the purpose of
15 this chapter;
16 (5) Perform any other acts necessary or proper to effectuate the purpose of this chapter;
17 and
18 (6) Refund to the member insurers in proportion to the contribution of each member insurer
19 to that account that amount by which the assets of the account exceed the liabilities, if, at the end
20 of any calendar year, the board of directors finds that the assets of the association in any account
21 exceed the liabilities of that account as estimated by the board of directors for the coming year.
22 (c) Suits involving the association:
23 (1) Except for actions by the receiver, all actions relating to or arising out of this chapter
24 against the association shall be brought in the courts in this state. The courts shall have exclusive
25 jurisdiction over all actions relating to or arising out of this chapter against the association.
26 (2) The exclusive venue in any action by or against the association is in the Providence
27 county superior court. The association may, at its option, waive this venue as to specific actions.
28 27-34-11.5. Net worth exclusion.
29 (a) For purposes of this section, “high net worth insured” shall mean any insured, excluding
30 state and local governments, whose net worth exceeds fifty million dollars ($50,000,000) on
31 December 31 of the year prior to the year in which the insurer becomes an insolvent insurer;
32 provided that an insured’s net worth on that date shall be deemed to include the aggregate net worth
33 of the insured and all of its subsidiaries and affiliates as calculated on a consolidated basis.
34 (b)(1) The association shall not be obligated to pay any first-party claims by a high net
LC001767/SUB A - Page 15 of 17
1 worth insured.
2 (2) The association shall have the right to recover from the high net worth insured all
3 amounts paid by the association to or on behalf of such insured, whether for indemnity, defense, or
4 otherwise.
5 (3) The association may also, at its sole discretion and without assumption of any ongoing
6 duty to do so, pay any cybersecurity insurance obligations covered by a policy or endorsement of
7 an insolvent company on behalf of a high net worth insured as defined in subsection (a) of this
8 section. In that case, the association shall recover from the high net worth insured under this section
9 all amounts paid on its behalf, all allocated claim adjusted expenses related to such claims, the
10 association’s attorneys’ fees, and all court costs in any action necessary to collect the full amount
11 to the association’s reimbursement under this section.
12 (c) The association shall not be obligated to pay any claim that would otherwise be a
13 covered claim that is an obligation to or on behalf of a person who has a net worth greater than that
14 allowed by the insurance guaranty association law of the state of residence of the claimant at the
15 time specified by that state’s applicable law, and which association has denied coverage to that
16 claimant on that basis.
17 (d) The association shall establish reasonable procedures subject to the approval of the
18 commissioner for requesting financial information from insureds on a confidential basis for
19 purposes of applying this section, provided that the financial information may be shared with any
20 other association similar to the association and the liquidator for the insolvent insurer on the same
21 confidential basis. Any request to an insured seeking financial information must advise the insured
22 of the consequences of failing to provide the financial information. If an insured refuses to provide
23 the requested financial information where it is requested and available, the association may, until
24 such time as the information is provided, provisionally deem the insured to be a high net worth
25 insured for the purpose of denying a claim under subsection (b).
26 (e) In any lawsuit contesting the applicability of this section where the insured has refused
27 to provide financial information under the procedure established pursuant to subsection (d), the
28 insured shall bear the burden of proof concerning its net worth at the relevant time. If the insured
29 fails to prove that its net worth at the relevant time was less than the applicable amount, the court
30 shall award the association its full costs, expenses, and reasonable attorney’s fees in contesting the
31 claim.
32 SECTION 3. This act shall take effect on January 1, 2026.

11 association to extend coverage to the policies assumed by a member insurer from a non-member
12 insurer in any assumed claims transaction including liabilities that may have arisen prior to the date
13 of the transaction. The assumption consideration shall be in an amount equal to the amount that
14 would have been paid by the assuming insurer during the three (3) calendar years prior to the
15 effective date of the transaction to the applicable guaranty associations if the business had been
16 written directly by the assuming insurer.
17 (i) In the event that the amount of the premiums for the three-year (3) period cannot be
18 determined, the assumption consideration will be determined by multiplying one hundred thirty
19 percent (130%) against the sum of the unpaid losses, loss adjustment expenses, and incurred but
20 not reported losses, as of the effective date of the assumed claims transaction, and then multiplying
21 such sum times the applicable guaranty association assessment percentage for the calendar year of
22 the transaction.

24 assessments made during the three-year (3) period. The guaranty association receiving the
25 assumption consideration shall not be required to recalculate or adjust any assessments levied
26 during the prior three (3) calendar years as a result of receiving the assumption consideration.

3 person. Control shall be presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds

26 insurer’s state of domicile;

28 remained the responsibility of the original member insurer and the order of liquidation had been
29 entered against the original member insurer, with the same claim submission date and liquidation
30 date; and
31 (D) In cases where the member’s coverage obligations were assumed by a non-member
32 insurer, the transaction received prior regulatory or judicial approval.

2 (C) An amount not exceeding one million dollars ($1,000,000) for all first-party property
3 loss claims arising from a single occurrence under a policy covering commercial or residential
4 property for all other covered claims for insolvencies occurring after January 1, 2026. An amount
5 not exceeding five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000), per claimant for all other covered claims

10 hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) for all first and third-party claims under a policy or
11 endorsement providing, or that is found to provide, cybersecurity insurance coverage and arising
12 out of or related to a single insured event, regardless of the number of claims made or the number
13 of claimants.
14 (ii) In no event shall the association be obligated to pay a claimant an amount in excess of
15 the obligation of the insolvent insurer under the policy or coverage from which the claim arises.
16 Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a covered claim shall not include a claim filed
17 with the guaranty association after the final date set by the court for the filing of claims against the
18 liquidator or receiver of an insolvent insurer. For the purpose of filing a claim under this subsection,
19 notice of claims to the liquidator of the insolvent insurer shall be deemed notice to the association
20 or its agent and a list of claims shall be periodically submitted to the association or association
21 similar to the association in another state by the liquidator.
22 (iii) Any obligation of the association to defend an insured shall cease upon the
23 association’s payment or tender of an amount equal to the lesser of the association’s covered claim
24 obligation limit or the applicable policy limit;
25 (2) Be deemed the insurer to the extent of its obligation on the covered claims and to that
26 extent, subject to the limitation provided in this chapter, shall have all rights, duties, and obligations
27 of the insolvent insurer as if the insurer had not become insolvent, including, but not limited to, the
28 right to pursue and retain salvage and subrogation recoverable on covered claim obligations to the
29 extent paid by the association. The association shall not be deemed the insolvent insurer for the
30 purpose of conferring jurisdiction;
31 (3) Allocate claims paid and expenses incurred among the three (3) accounts separately,
32 and assess member insurers separately for each account amounts necessary to pay the obligations
33 of the association under subdivision (a)(1) subsequent to an insolvency, the expenses of handling
34 covered claims subsequent to an insolvency, and other expenses authorized by this chapter. The
LC001767/SUB A - Page 11 of 17

1 assessments of each member insurer shall be in the proportion that the net direct written premiums
2 of the member insurer for the calendar year preceding the assessment on the kinds of insurance in
3 the account bears to the net direct written premiums of all member insurers for the calendar year
4 preceding the assessment on the kinds of insurance in the account. Each member insurer shall be
5 notified of the assessment not later than thirty (30) days before it is due.
6 A member insurer may not be assessed in any one year on any account an amount greater
7 than two percent (2%) of that member insurer’s net direct written premiums for the calendar year
8 preceding the assessment on the kinds of insurance in the account. If the maximum assessment,
9 together with the other assets of the association in any account, does not provide in any one year in
10 any account an amount sufficient to make all necessary payments from that account, each member
11 insurer shall be assessed the additional amount that must be obtained to make all necessary
12 payments of the underfunded account from the other two accounts, subject to the same limitation
13 of two percent (2%) of that member insurer’s net direct written premiums for the calendar year
14 preceding the assessment on the kinds of insurance in the account. The additional assessments shall
15 be considered loans by and between the separate accounts. Amounts borrowed under this
16 subsection shall be paid back to the separate accounts from which they were borrowed, out of
17 assets, including, but not limited to, existing and future assessments in the account receiving the
18 loan. An interest charge shall be levied on all amounts borrowed under this subsection based on the
19 average prime rate of interest for each year the money remains unpaid. If the amounts borrowed
20 remain unpaid on the seventh yearly anniversary as a result of the inability of the borrowing account
21 to make repayment, then the amount borrowed and interest which is not repaid, starting with the
22 principal and interest of the first year, shall be considered uncollectible. The funds available shall
23 be prorated and the unpaid portion shall be paid as soon after this as funds become available. The
24 association may exempt or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of any member insurer if the
25 assessment would cause the member insurer’s financial statement to reflect amounts of capital or
26 surplus less than the minimum amounts required for a certificate of authority by any jurisdiction in
27 which the member insurer is authorized to transact insurance. However, during the period of
28 deferment, no dividends shall be paid to shareholders or policyholders. Deferred assessments shall
29 be paid when the payment will not reduce capital or surplus below required minimums. Payments
30 shall be refunded to those companies receiving larger assessments by virtue of the deferment, or,
31 at the election of any company, credited against future assessments;
32 (4) Investigate claims brought against the association and adjust, compromise, settle, and
33 pay covered claims to the extent of the association’s obligation and deny all other claims. The
34 association shall pay claims in any order that it may deem reasonable, including the payment of
LC001767/SUB A - Page 12 of 17

1 claims as they are received from the claimants or in groups or categories of claims. The association
2 shall have the right to appoint and to direct legal counsel retained under liability insurance policies
3 for the defense of covered claims and to appoint and direct other service providers for covered
4 services;
5 (5) Notify claimants in this state as deemed necessary by the commissioner and upon the
6 commissioner’s request, to the extent records are available to the association;
7 (6)(i) Have the right to review and contest as set forth in this subsection settlements,
8 releases, compromises, waivers, and judgments to which the insolvent insurer or its insureds were
9 parties prior to the entry of the order of liquidation. In an action to enforce settlements, releases,
10 and judgments to which the insolvent insurer or its insureds were parties prior to the entry of the
11 order of liquidation, the association shall have the right to assert the following defenses, in addition
12 to the defenses available to the insurer:
13 (A) The association is not bound by a settlement, release, compromise, or waiver executed
14 by an insured or the insurer, or any judgment entered against an insured or the insurer by consent
15 or through a failure to exhaust all appeals, if the settlement, release, compromise, waiver, or
16 judgment was:
17 (I) Executed or entered into within one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the entry of an
18 order of liquidation, and the insured or the insurer did not use reasonable care in entering into the
19 settlement, release, compromise, waiver, or judgment, or did not pursue all reasonable appeals of
20 an adverse judgment; or
21 (II) Executed by or taken against an insured or the insurer based on default, fraud, collusion,
22 or the insurer’s failure to defend.
23 (B) If a court of competent jurisdiction finds that the association is not bound by a
24 settlement, release, compromise, waiver, or judgment for the reasons described in subparagraph
25 (i)(A), the settlement, release, compromise, waiver, or judgment shall be set aside, and the
26 association shall be permitted to defend any covered claim on the merits. The settlement, release,
27 compromise, waiver, or judgment may not be considered as evidence of liability or damages in
28 connection with any claim brought against the association or any other party under this chapter.
29 (C) The association shall have the right to assert any statutory defenses or rights of offset
30 against any settlement, release, compromise, or waiver executed by an insured or the insurer, or
31 any judgment taken against the insured or the insurer.
32 (ii) As to any covered claims arising from a judgment under any decision, verdict, or
33 finding based on the default of the insolvent insurer or its failure to defend, the association, either
34 on its own behalf or on behalf of an insured, may apply to have the judgment, order, decision,
LC001767/SUB A - Page 13 of 17

1 verdict, or finding set aside by the same court or administrator that entered the judgment, order,
2 decision, verdict, or finding and shall be permitted to defend the claim on the merits;
3 (7) Handle claims through its employees or through one or more insurers or other persons
4 designated as servicing facilities. Designation of a servicing facility is subject to the approval of
5 the commissioner, but the designation may be declined by a member insurer;
6 (8) Reimburse each servicing facility for obligations of the association paid by the facility
7 and for expenses incurred by the facility while handling claims on behalf of the association and
8 shall pay the other expenses of the association authorized by this chapter;
9 (9)(i) The association shall obtain a line of credit for the benefit of each account, in an
10 amount not to exceed the applicable maximum to ensure the immediate availability of funds for
11 purposes of future claims and expenses attributable to an insurer insolvency in that account. The
12 line of credit shall be obtained from qualified financial institutions. The line of credit shall provide
13 for a thirty-day (30) notice of termination or nonrenewal to the commissioner and the association
14 and shall provide funding to the association within three (3) business days of receipt of written
15 notice from the commissioner of an insolvent insurer in that account. Each member insurer upon
16 receipt of notice from the association shall make immediate payment for its proportionate share of
17 the amount borrowed based on the premium for the preceding calendar year. The maximum line of
18 credit or preinsolvency assessment for each account shall be subject to prior review and approval
19 by the commissioner at the time of origination.
20 (ii) If the association cannot obtain a line of credit, the association may obtain an
21 irrevocable line of credit agreement from each member insurer in an amount not to exceed the
22 member insurer’s maximum assessment pursuant to subdivision (a)(3) to ensure the immediate
23 availability of funds for the purposes of future claims and expenses attributable to an insurer
24 insolvency.
25 Any amount drawn under any line of credit shall be considered a payment toward the
26 member insurer’s assessment provided for in subdivision (a)(3).
27 The member insurer shall provide funding to the association under the line of credit within
28 three (3) business days of receipt of a written request from the association for a draw-down under
29 the line of credit.
30 The line of credit agreement shall be subject to prior review and approval by the
31 commissioner at the time of origination and any subsequent renewal. It shall include any
32 commercially reasonable provisions the association or the commissioner may deem advisable,
33 including a provision that the line of credit is irrevocable or for a stated period of time and provides
34 for thirty-day (30) notice to the association and the commissioner that the line is being terminated
LC001767/SUB A - Page 14 of 17

1 or not renewed.
2 (iii) If a line of credit is not given as provided for in this section, the member insurer shall
3 be responsible for the payment of an assessment of up to the member’s proportionate share of the
4 applicable maximum as set forth in this subsection which shall be paid into a pre-insolvency
5 assessment fund in each account;
6 (10) Submit, not later than ninety (90) days after the end of the association’s fiscal year, a
7 financial report for the preceding fiscal year in a form approved by the commissioner.
8 (b) The association may:
9 (1) Employ or retain persons as are necessary to handle claims and perform other duties of
10 the association;
11 (2) Borrow funds necessary to effect the purposes of this chapter in accordance with the
12 plan of operation;
13 (3) Sue or be sued;
14 (4) Negotiate and become a party to any contracts necessary to carry out the purpose of
15 this chapter;
16 (5) Perform any other acts necessary or proper to effectuate the purpose of this chapter;
17 and
18 (6) Refund to the member insurers in proportion to the contribution of each member insurer
19 to that account that amount by which the assets of the account exceed the liabilities, if, at the end
20 of any calendar year, the board of directors finds that the assets of the association in any account
21 exceed the liabilities of that account as estimated by the board of directors for the coming year.
22 (c) Suits involving the association:
23 (1) Except for actions by the receiver, all actions relating to or arising out of this chapter
24 against the association shall be brought in the courts in this state. The courts shall have exclusive
25 jurisdiction over all actions relating to or arising out of this chapter against the association.
26 (2) The exclusive venue in any action by or against the association is in the Providence
27 county superior court. The association may, at its option, waive this venue as to specific actions.
28 27-34-11.5. Net worth exclusion.
29 (a) For purposes of this section, “high net worth insured” shall mean any insured, excluding
30 state and local governments, whose net worth exceeds fifty million dollars ($50,000,000) on
31 December 31 of the year prior to the year in which the insurer becomes an insolvent insurer;

33 of the insured and all of its subsidiaries and affiliates as calculated on a consolidated basis.
34 (b)(1) The association shall not be obligated to pay any first-party claims by a high net
LC001767/SUB A - Page 15 of 17

1 worth insured.
2 (2) The association shall have the right to recover from the high net worth insured all
3 amounts paid by the association to or on behalf of such insured, whether for indemnity, defense, or
4 otherwise.
5 (3) The association may also, at its sole discretion and without assumption of any ongoing
6 duty to do so, pay any cybersecurity insurance obligations covered by a policy or endorsement of
7 an insolvent company on behalf of a high net worth insured as defined in subsection (a) of this
8 section. In that case, the association shall recover from the high net worth insured under this section
9 all amounts paid on its behalf, all allocated claim adjusted expenses related to such claims, the
10 association’s attorneys’ fees, and all court costs in any action necessary to collect the full amount
11 to the association’s reimbursement under this section.
12 (c) The association shall not be obligated to pay any claim that would otherwise be a
13 covered claim that is an obligation to or on behalf of a person who has a net worth greater than that
14 allowed by the insurance guaranty association law of the state of residence of the claimant at the
15 time specified by that state’s applicable law, and which association has denied coverage to that
16 claimant on that basis.
17 (d) The association shall establish reasonable procedures subject to the approval of the
18 commissioner for requesting financial information from insureds on a confidential basis for
19 purposes of applying this section, provided that the financial information may be shared with any
20 other association similar to the association and the liquidator for the insolvent insurer on the same
21 confidential basis. Any request to an insured seeking financial information must advise the insured
22 of the consequences of failing to provide the financial information. If an insured refuses to provide
23 the requested financial information where it is requested and available, the association may, until
24 such time as the information is provided, provisionally deem the insured to be a high net worth
25 insured for the purpose of denying a claim under subsection (b).
26 (e) In any lawsuit contesting the applicability of this section where the insured has refused
27 to provide financial information under the procedure established pursuant to subsection (d), the
28 insured shall bear the burden of proof concerning its net worth at the relevant time. If the insured
29 fails to prove that its net worth at the relevant time was less than the applicable amount, the court
30 shall award the association its full costs, expenses, and reasonable attorney’s fees in contesting the
31 claim.
32 SECTION 3. This act shall take effect on January 1, 2026.
