HONORING RANDALL ASHE FOR HIS EXCELLENCE AS A JAZZ MUSICIAN,
THEATER PERFORMER, AND FOR HIS LONG CAREER OF PUBLIC SERVICE
Introduced By: Senator Tiara T. Mack
Date Introduced: February 10, 2025
Referred To: Placed on the Senate Consent Calendar
1 WHEREAS, Randall Ashe is a talented jazz musician who has used his extraordinary
2 abilities to not only entertain people, but to break the barriers of racism and poverty to improve
3 the lives of countless people who have been blessed to be in his presence and to interact with him;
4 and
5 WHEREAS, Randall Ashe was born in Providence, where he attended Providence public
6 schools, the Community College of Rhode Island, and the Berklee College of Music in Boston;
7 and
8 WHEREAS, As an especially talented and gifted young musician and theater performer,
9 Mr. Ashe traveled from the age of 13 throughout the Northeast, playing his music in venues of all
10 sizes in places like Newport and Montreal, with groups and entertainers such as Trio Lac, Earl
11 “Father” Hines, Bill Doggett, Big Mama Thornton, Max Roach, and other influential musicians;
12 and
13 WHEREAS, Randall Ashe’s gift for performing also extended to the theater. At the age
14 of 13, he performed at the Providence Playhouse, with roles in three of their productions,
15 including Finian’s Rainbow, Native Son, and Tobacco Road. Tragically, the specter of racism
16 that he often faced while performing his music at various nightclub venues, would rise up again
17 when the Providence City leaders in 1953 shut down the production of Tobacco Road due to its
18 theme of interracial romance; and
19 WHEREAS, In spite of the overwhelming racism, Mr. Ashe persevered, and thanks to the

1 superb mentorship and tutelage he received from talented artists such as George Geer on the
2 drums, Camillo Naclerio on the Saxophone, and Joe Viola of the Berklee College of Music,
3 Randall Ashe’s career soon thrived and he would perform regularly at the top nightclubs and
4 venues in the Rhode Island area; and
5 WHEREAS, Beginning in the 1970s, and on into the 1980s, Mr. Ashe transitioned his
6 career from performing to being an Arts Administrator, television producer, and manager of
7 performers. In 1970, Mr. Ashe accepted a position to serve as the inaugural Musical Director for
8 the Afro Arts Center, and he used his connections to the performers supporting the War on
9 Poverty, to bring world class musical performers to Providence. Hall of Fame performers such as
10 Earth, Wind, and Fire, and Curtis Mayfield all performed in Providence thanks to Randall Ashe;
11 and
12 WHEREAS, As a television producer, Mr. Ashe created the children’s television show
13 “The Happy Clown Puppet Show”, and the variety show "Ashe & Company". He also managed
14 the musical acts, The Revlons, who were three talented and charming ladies from Georgia, and
15 the popular group Rhythm; and
16 WHEREAS, In the mid 1980s, Randall Ashe once again transitioned in his career and
17 began to focus on public service. He began working at Roger Williams Park, and he served for
18 one year on the Human Relations Commission for the City of Providence. In 1997, he accepted a
19 position to serve with the City of Providence in the Department of Recreation, retiring in 2012 as
20 the Special Events Coordinator for the department; and
21 WHEREAS, Randall Ashe continues to support his community on a daily basis, primarily
22 through his support of the Saint Martin de Porres Senior Center where his unlimited energy,
23 vitality and charming smiles brighten the daily lives of the staff, residents and patients; now,
24 therefore be it
25 RESOLVED, That this Senate of the State of Rhode Island hereby heartily honors and
26 thanks Randall Ashe for his excellence as a Jazz musician, theater performer, and for his long
27 career of public service; and be it further
28 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
29 transmit a duly certified copy of this resolution to Mr. Randall Ashe.
