19 disposition of all or substantially all the property and assets of the commission, or amending the
20 by-laws of the commission.
21 (d) Any action required by this act to be taken at a meeting of the board of commissioners
22 or any action which may be taken at a meeting of the board of commissioners, or committee thereof,
