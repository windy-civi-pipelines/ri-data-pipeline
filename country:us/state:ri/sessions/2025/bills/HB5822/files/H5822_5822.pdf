RELATING TO PUBLIC UTILITIES AND CARRIERS -- SOLAR SITING ADVISORY
TASKFORCE
Introduced By: Representatives Phillips, Morales, Dawson, Casey, Lima, J. Brien,
Finkelman, Shanley, Read, and Batista
Date Introduced: February 28, 2025
Referred To: House Corporations
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. The general assembly finds that:
2 (1) Facilitating and promoting installation of renewable energy infrastructure to reduce
3 carbon emissions that contribute to climate change requires consideration of siting impacts on the
4 environment.
5 (2) Installing renewable energy infrastructure on areas ill-suited for diverse development
6 types, which includes interstate rights of way and state-owned properties such as the parking areas
7 and rooftops of public, municipal, or state-owned buildings, would assist the state to meet its
8 climate resiliency goals, including those established in chapter 6.2 of title 42 ("act on climate"),
9 while minimizing environmental impact.
10 (3) Placing solar energy systems on interstate rights of way would ensure that solar energy
11 systems are not surrounded by sunlight blocking structures, and ensure that engineers will have
12 clear access for the purposes of construction, interconnection, repair, and maintenance.
13 (4) The use of interstate rights of way to accommodate solar energy systems is permissible
14 provided such developments comply with federal laws, federal regulations, state law, and the state
15 utility accommodation policy.
16 (5) By using interstate rights of way, Rhode Island can reduce the number of trees required
17 to be removed to support the installation of solar energy systems, and promote the preservation of
18 trees.

1 (6) The department of transportation has identified at least two hundred (200) acres at
2 several sites on interstate rights of way that are potential viable locations for solar energy systems.
3 (7) The department of environmental management has developed guidelines for the
4 installation of solar energy systems on sites within their jurisdiction, and offers pre-application
5 meetings with applicants to coordinate projects that involve multiple permits, in order to decrease
6 the time necessary to process the proposal.
7 (8) Challenges to successful implementation of solar energy systems includes the cost and
8 process necessary to interconnect solar energy systems to the electrical grid.
9 (9) The state may expedite solar energy system installations by having state agencies and
10 key stakeholders with jurisdiction and/or subject matter expertise provide technical assistance and
11 professional advice.
12 SECTION 2. Title 39 of the General Laws entitled "PUBLIC UTILITIES AND
13 CARRIERS" is hereby amended by adding thereto the following chapter:
