12 (4)(5) Whenever an order prohibiting contact is issued, modified, or terminated under
13 subdivision (1), (2) or (3) of this subsection, the clerk of the court shall forward a copy of the order

29 involving domestic violence shall be conditioned upon the defendant keeping the peace and being
30 of good behavior for a period of three (3) years. In the event a particular case involving domestic
31 violence is filed on a plea of not guilty, guilty or nolo contendere pursuant to § 12-10-12, the court

1 SECTION 1. Section 8-8.1-3 of the General Laws in Chapter 8-8.1 entitled "Domestic
2 Assault" is hereby amended to read as follows:
3 8-8.1-3. Protective orders — Penalty — Jurisdiction.
4 (a) A person suffering from domestic abuse may file a complaint in the district court
5 requesting any order that will protect them from the abuse, including, but not limited to, the
6 following:
7 (1) Ordering that the defendant be restrained and enjoined from contacting, assaulting,

13 (4) Ordering the defendant to surrender physical possession of all firearms in his or her
14 possession, care, custody, or control and shall further order a person restrained not to purchase or
15 receive, or attempt to purchase or receive, any firearms while the protective order is in effect. The
16 defendant shall surrender the firearms within twenty-four (24) hours of notice of the protective
17 order to the Rhode Island state police or local police department or to a federally licensed firearms
18 dealer.
19 (i) A person ordered to surrender possession of any firearm(s) pursuant to this section shall,

1 within seventy-two (72) hours after being served with the order, either:
2 (A) File with the court a receipt showing the firearm(s) was physically surrendered to the
3 Rhode Island state police or local police department, or to a federally licensed firearm dealer; or
4 (B) Attest to the court that, at the time of the order, the person had no firearms in their
5 immediate physical possession or control, or subject to their immediate physical possession or

12 house, who is not related to the person by blood, marriage, or relationship as defined by § 15-15-
13 1(7), and who is not prohibited from possessing firearms under state or federal law. The owner of
14 any firearm(s) sold shall receive any financial value received from its sale, less the cost associated

16 (iii) Every individual to whom possession of a firearm(s) is transferred pursuant to this
17 subsection shall be prohibited from transferring or returning any firearm(s) to the person restrained

20 of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000), or by imprisonment for a term of not less than one
21 year and not more than five (5) years, or both.
22 (iv) An individual to whom possession of a firearm(s) is transferred pursuant to this
23 subsection shall return a firearm(s) to the person formerly restrained under this section only if the

25 that the restraining order issued pursuant to this section that prohibited the person from purchasing,
26 carrying, transporting, or possessing firearms has expired and has not been extended.
27 (b) After notice to the respondent and after a hearing, which shall be held within fifteen
28 (15) days of surrendering said firearms, the court, in addition to any other restrictions, may, for any
29 protective order issued or renewed on or after July 1, 2017, continue the order of surrender, and
30 shall further order a person restrained under this section not to purchase or receive, or attempt to
31 purchase or receive, any firearms while the protective order is in effect.
32 (c) The district court shall provide a notice on all forms requesting a protective order that
33 a person restrained under this section shall be ordered pursuant to § 11-47-5, to surrender
34 possession or control of any firearms and not to purchase or receive, or attempt to purchase or
LC002809 - Page 2 of 12

1 receive, any firearms while the restraining order is in effect. The form shall further provide that any
2 person who has surrendered their firearms shall be afforded a hearing within fifteen (15) days of
3 surrendering their firearms.
4 (d) Any firearm surrendered in accordance with this section to the Rhode Island state police
5 or local police department shall be returned to the person formerly restrained under this section
6 upon their request when:

9 from purchasing, carrying, transporting, or possessing firearms has expired and has not been
10 extended; and
11 (2) The law enforcement agency in possession of the firearms determines that the person
12 formerly restrained under this section is not otherwise prohibited from possessing a firearm under
13 state or federal law.
14 (3) The person required to surrender his or her firearms pursuant to this section shall not
15 be responsible for any costs of storage of any firearms surrendered pursuant to this section.
16 (e) The Rhode Island state police are authorized to develop rules and procedures pertaining
17 to the storage and return of firearms surrendered to the Rhode Island state police or local police
18 departments pursuant to this section. The Rhode Island state police may consult with the Rhode
19 Island Police Chiefs’ Association in developing rules and procedures.
20 (f) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit, expand, or in any way modify orders
21 issued under § 12-29-4 or § 15-5-19.
22 (g) Nothing in this section shall limit a defendant’s right under existing law to petition the
23 court at a later date for modification of the order.

28 restrained under this section shall all have an opportunity to be present and to testify when the court
29 considers the petition.
30 (j) At the hearing, the person restrained under this section shall have the burden of showing,
31 by clear and convincing evidence, that, if their firearm rights were restored, they would not pose a
32 danger to the person suffering from domestic abuse or to any other person.
33 (1) In determining whether to restore a person’s firearm rights, the court shall examine all
34 relevant evidence, including, but not limited to: the complaint seeking a protective order; the
LC002809 - Page 3 of 12

1 criminal record of the person restrained under this section; the mental health history of the person
2 restrained under this section; any evidence that the person restrained under this section has, since
3 being served with the order, engaged in violent or threatening behavior against the person suffering
4 from domestic abuse or any other person.
5 (2) If the court determines, after a review of all relevant evidence and after all parties have
6 had an opportunity to be heard, that the person restrained under this section would not pose a danger
7 to the person suffering from domestic abuse or to any other person if the person’s firearm rights
8 were restored, then the court may grant the petition and modify the protective order and lift the
9 firearm prohibition.
10 (3) If the court lifts a person’s firearms prohibition pursuant to this subsection, the court
11 shall issue the person written notice that the person is no longer prohibited under this section from
12 purchasing or possessing firearms while the protective order is in effect.
13 (k) The prohibition against possessing a firearm(s) due solely to the existence of a domestic
14 violence restraining order issued under this section shall not apply with respect to sworn peace
15 officers as defined in § 12-7-21 and active members of military service, including members of the
16 reserve components thereof, who are required by law or departmental policy to carry departmental
17 firearms while on duty or any person who is required by their employment to carry a firearm in the
18 performance of his or her duties. Any individual exempted pursuant to this exception may possess
19 a firearm only during the course of his or her employment. Any firearm required for employment
20 must be stored at the place of employment when not being possessed for employment use; all other
21 firearm(s) must be surrendered in accordance with this section.
22 (l) Any violation of the aforementioned protective order shall subject the defendant to being
23 found in contempt of court.
24 (m) No order shall issue under this section that would have the effect of compelling a
25 defendant who has the sole legal interest in a residence to vacate that residence.
26 (n) The contempt order shall not be exclusive and shall not preclude any other available
27 civil or criminal remedies. Any relief granted by the court shall be for a fixed period of time not to
28 exceed three (3) years, at the expiration of which time the court may extend any order upon motion
29 of the plaintiff for such additional time as it deems necessary to protect the plaintiff from abuse.
30 The court may modify its order at any time upon motion of either party.
31 (o) Any violation of a protective order under this chapter of which the defendant has actual
32 notice shall be a misdemeanor that shall be punished by a fine of no more than one thousand dollars
33 ($1,000) or by imprisonment for not more than one year, or both. Beginning July 1, 2025, said

2 (4) Beginning July 1, 2025, said violation shall, at the initial appearance, be presented by

11 A copy of the order shall be provided to the victim.
12 (4)(5) Whenever an order prohibiting contact is issued, modified, or terminated under
13 subdivision (1), (2) or (3) of this subsection, the clerk of the court shall forward a copy of the order
14 on or before the next judicial day to the appropriate law enforcement agency specified in the order.

29 involving domestic violence shall be conditioned upon the defendant keeping the peace and being
30 of good behavior for a period of three (3) years. In the event a particular case involving domestic
31 violence is filed on a plea of not guilty, guilty or nolo contendere pursuant to § 12-10-12, the court
32 having jurisdiction shall retain the records of the case for a period of three (3) years from the date
