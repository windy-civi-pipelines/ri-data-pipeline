4 (a) Any facility or program licensed by the department pursuant to § 40.1-24-1 et seq. and

8 police department or, a qualified vendor, or for organizations employing two hundred fifty (250)
9 or more employees only, the office of the attorney general for a nationwide criminal records check.
10 The check will conform to the applicable state and federal standards, including the taking of

12 general for a check of state records and thereafter forwarded to the Federal Bureau of Investigation
13 (“FBI”) for a national criminal history check. The criminal records checks as required by this
14 section shall be conducted for every five (5) years of continuous employment from the date of the

16 (b) If any disqualifying information is discovered with respect to the applicant, the bureau
17 of criminal identification of the state police or the local police department or the office of the
18 attorney general will inform the employer, in writing, without disclosing the nature of the
1 disqualifying information, that an item of disqualifying nature has been discovered. In addition, the
2 bureau of criminal identification of the state police or the local police department or the office of

15 or the local police department or the office of the attorney general to conduct the national criminal
