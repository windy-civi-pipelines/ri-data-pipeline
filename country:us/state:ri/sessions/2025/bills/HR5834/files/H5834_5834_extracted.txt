1 WHEREAS, Rhode Island General Laws § 42-6.2-8 provides that it is the declared policy
2 of the State that “addressing the impacts on climate change shall be deemed to be within the
3 powers, duties, and obligations of all state departments, agencies, commissions, councils, and
4 instrumentalities, including quasi-public agencies, and each shall exercise among its purposes in
5 the exercise of its existing authority, the purposes set forth in this chapter pertaining to climate
6 change mitigation, adaptation, and resilience in so far as climate change affects its mission,
7 duties, responsibilities, projects, or programs”; and
8 WHEREAS, Existing electric rates jeopardize Rhode Island’s decarbonization goals as
9 they pose a barrier to building and transportation electrification; now, therefore be it
10 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
11 respectfully requests the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission (PUC), Office of Energy
12 Resources (OER), and Department of Environmental Management (DEM) to undertake a report
13 with stakeholder participation to identify issues related to current electric rate structure and
14 potential rate reform strategies to ensure electric rates are not a consistent obstacle to Rhode
15 Island’s decarbonization goals. This study shall consider:
16 (1) Rates that accommodate building and transportation electrification, and new loads,
17 and minimize or mitigate impact on ratepayers, especially low- and moderate-income ratepayers;
18 (2) How the 2025 Climate Action Strategy should consider rate reform in their “transition
1 away from fossil fuels” section of their report; and
2 (3) What alternatives Rhode Island’s electric distribution company should propose to
3 their current rate design structure in their next distribution rate case; now, therefore be it
4 RESOLVED, That this House, in order to support building and transportation
5 electrification, hereby requests the PUC, OER, and DEM to report whether new electric rate
6 structures are necessary to meet Act on Climate goals; and be it further
7 RESOLVED, That this House hereby also requests the PUC, OER, and DEM to report
8 their findings and recommendations to the House on or before September 1, 2025; and be it
