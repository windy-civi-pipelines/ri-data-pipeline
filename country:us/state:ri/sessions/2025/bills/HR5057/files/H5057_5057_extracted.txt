7 passion for teaching history and making a positive difference in the lives of so many of his

19 league play from 2013 to 2017, and captured their first undisputed Division II Super Bowl
20 Championship in 2017. He retired from coaching in 2019 after winning an unpreceded three
1 straight championship trophies; and
2 WHEREAS, Joseph Gilmartin was also an avid outdoorsman who enjoyed spending time
3 communing with nature and a devoted fisherman who enjoyed spending time fishing in both

5 Association; and

9 numerous nieces, nephews and cousins; and
10 WHEREAS, Joseph A. Gilmartin's passing is a tragic loss for his loving family, many
11 friends, and the North Kingstown community. He was a bright, shining light and a force for good
12 who made a positive difference in the lives of his students, many friends, and his loved ones, and
13 he will long live on in the hearts and memories of all who knew him; now, therefore be it
14 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
