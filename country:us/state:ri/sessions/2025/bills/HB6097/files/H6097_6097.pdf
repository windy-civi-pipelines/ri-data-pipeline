15 acquired, constructed, rehabilitated, renovated, repaired or operated, to house a group of networked
16 computer servers, regardless of whether any such development, acquisition, construction,
17 rehabilitation, renovation, repair or operation was contemplated at the time of entering into the
18 agreement;
19 (ii) Any additional enterprise information technology equipment used by a qualified data
20 center that is acquired after the date the agreement was entered into; and
21 (iii) Any additional facility acquired by the owner of a qualified data center for the
22 development, construction, rehabilitation, renovation, repair or operation of a qualified data center,
23 after the date of the agreement was entered into, provided such owner enters into a negotiated host
24 municipality fee agreement as required under this section for each such additional facility.
25 (3) The secretary of commerce shall notify each municipality in which a facility is located

LC002350 - Page 12 of 15

1 municipalities, the owner shall enter into a negotiated host municipality fee agreement for each
2 additional facility that shall be a qualified data center that the owner acquires. If a facility is located

4 agreement with each such municipality.
5 (ii) Each negotiated host municipality fee agreement shall include provisions for the
6 assessment and payment of the tax under chapter 3 of title 44 ("property subject to taxation")
7 exempted pursuant to the agreement entered into pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, and the
8 rates or amounts of penalties and interest to be imposed thereon, if the legislative body of the
9 municipality in which the qualified data center is located determines that the requirements of the
10 negotiated host municipality fee agreement are not being met or have not been met.
11 (5) The chief elected official of the municipality in which a qualified data center is located
12 shall notify the qualified data center if the legislative body of the municipality determines the
13 requirements of a negotiated host municipality fee agreement entered into pursuant to the
14 provisions of this subsection are not being met or have not been met. The qualified data center shall
15 cure the noncompliance not later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of such
16 notification. If the legislative body of such municipality determines the noncompliance has not
17 been cured, the negotiated host municipality fee agreement shall be terminated.
18 (6) Upon termination of a negotiated host municipality fee agreement pursuant to the
19 provisions of this subsection or subsection (e)(2) of this section, the qualified data center, the owner
20 of the property on which the qualified data center is located or the owner’s successors or assigns
21 shall be subject to the tax imposed under chapter 3 of title 44 ("property subject to taxation") and
22 shall be liable for the payment of the taxes on the property that was exempted from taxation, from
23 the date of noncompliance under subsection (d)(5) of this section or the date of termination under
24 subsection (e)(2) of this section, as applicable. Such liability shall attach to the property as a charge
25 thereon. The tax and any related penalty and interest shall be due, payable and collectible as other
26 municipal taxes and subject to the same liens and processes of collection.
27 (e)(1) If the corporation terminates an agreement entered into pursuant to subsection (b) of
28 this section due to making the determination that the requirements of the agreement or of a qualified
29 data center are not being met or have not been met the secretary of commerce shall notify the tax
30 administrator and the chief elected official of the municipality in which the applicable qualified
31 data center is located of the termination.
32 (2) Any negotiated host municipality fee agreement entered into pursuant to subsection
33 (d)(4) of this section by such qualified data center shall be terminated as of the date of the agreement
34 entered into pursuant to subsection (b) of this section is terminated. The municipality in which the
LC002350 - Page 13 of 15

1 qualified data center is located may use any remedy authorized by the general laws to secure the
2 interest of the municipality and recover the amount of any fee, tax, penalty and interest that become
3 due and owing to the municipality due to the termination.
4 (3) The amount of taxes under chapter 18 of title 44 ("sales and use taxes-liability and
5 computation"), penalty or interest that becomes due and owing pursuant to the termination by the
6 corporation of an agreement entered into pursuant to subsection (b) of this section may be collected
7 by the tax administrator under the provisions of chapter 1 of title 44 ("state tax officials"). The
8 amount of any such tax, penalty or interest shall be a lien on the real estate of the qualified data
9 center from the last day of the month next proceeding the due date of such tax until the tax is paid.
10 The tax administrator may record the lien in the records of any municipality in which the real estate
11 of the qualified data center is located but no lien pursuant to the provisions of this subsection shall
12 be enforceable against a bona fide purchaser or qualified encumbrancer of the real estate. When
13 any tax with respect to which a lien has been recorded under the provisions of this subsection has
14 been satisfied, the tax administrator shall, upon request of any interested party, issue a certificate
15 discharging the lien, which certificate shall be recorded in the same office in which the lien was
16 recorded. Any action for the foreclosure of the lien shall be brought by the attorney general in the
17 name of the state in the superior court for the county in which the real estate subject to the lien is
18 located, or, if the property is located in two (2) or more counties, in the superior court for one of
19 the counties, and the court may limit the time for redemption or order the sale of the real estate or
20 make such other or further decree as it judges equitable.
21 SECTION 3. This act shall take effect upon passage.
