CELEBRATING RHODE ISLAND INDEPENDENCE DAY ON MAY 4, 2025
Introduced By: Senators de la Cruz, Gu, Sosnowski, LaMountain, Raptakis, DiPalma,
Murray, Rogers, Paolino, and Thompson
Date Introduced: May 07, 2025
Referred To: Recommended for Immediate Consideration
1 WHEREAS, Rhode Island colonists were considered to be "the most radical religious
2 dissenters from the Puritans of the Massachusetts Bay Colony," and as our new State and indeed
3 our new Nation, independent of the British crown, began to take form, great leaders emerged to
4 lead the way; and
5 WHEREAS, Relations between Rhode Island colonists and their British rulers
6 deteriorated rapidly after the 1772 incident in which Rhode Island colonists, angered by
7 continued British attempts to impose taxes in ways that the colonists perceived to be unfair,
8 boarded and burned the British customs ship, Gaspee, which had run aground near Warwick,
9 while patrolling the coastal waters in search of local smugglers; and
10 WHEREAS, One of our State's most renowned colonial leaders was Nathanael Greene.
11 He was born on Forge Farm at Potowomut in the township of Warwick, Rhode Island, but later
12 moved to Coventry to take charge of the family-owned forge. He began his military career as a
13 militia private, the lowest rank possible, but was eventually elevated to commander of the
14 colonial militia. He led troops in the Continental Army at Boston and New York, then fought in
15 battles at Trenton, Brandywine, and Germantown; and
16 WHEREAS, Nathanael Greene played an additional role in shaping our State. He served
17 as a deputy of the Rhode Island Assembly. Thomas Jefferson once wrote that Nathanael Greene
18 was "second to no one in enterprise, in resource, in sound judgment, promptitude of decision, and
19 every other military talent"; and
20 WHEREAS, Our State's founders formed, protected, and represented the first colony to

1 renounce allegiance to King George III; and
2 WHEREAS, The celebration of Rhode Island Independence Day on May 4th is a "tribute
3 to the memory of the members of our General Assembly, who, on the fourth day of May, 1776, in
4 the State House at Providence, passed an act renouncing allegiance of the colony to the British
5 crown and by the provisions of that act declared Rhode Island sovereign and independent, the
6 first official act of its kind by any of the thirteen American colonies"; now, therefore be it
7 RESOLVED, That this Senate of the State of Rhode Island hereby joins citizens from
8 across our Ocean State in celebrating Rhode Island Independence Day on May 4th of 2025; and be
9 it further
10 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
11 transmit a duly certified copy of this resolution to the Nathanael Greene Homestead Association,
12 Inc.
