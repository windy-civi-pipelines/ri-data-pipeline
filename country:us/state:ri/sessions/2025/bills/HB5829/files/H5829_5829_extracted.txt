23 21-28.11-31. Social equity assistance program and fund.
24 (a)(1) Findings. The general assembly finds that additional efforts are needed to reduce
25 barriers to ownership and/or participation in the cannabis industry for individuals and communities
26 most adversely impacted by the enforcement of cannabis-related laws.
27 (2) In the interest of establishing a legal cannabis industry that is equitable and accessible
28 to those most adversely impacted by the enforcement of cannabis-related laws, the general
29 assembly finds and declares that a social equity program should be established.
30 (3) The general assembly also finds and declares that individuals who have been arrested
31 or incarcerated due to cannabis related laws suffer long-lasting negative consequences, including
32 impacts to employment, business ownership, housing, health, and long-term financial well-being.
33 (4) The general assembly also finds and declares that family members, especially children,
34 and communities of those who have been arrested or incarcerated due to cannabis related laws,
LC001964 - Page 10 of 16
1 suffer from emotional, psychological, and financial harms as a result of such arrests or
2 incarcerations.
3 (5) Furthermore, the general assembly finds and declares that certain communities have
4 disproportionately suffered the harms of enforcement of cannabis-related laws. Those communities
5 face greater difficulties accessing capital to finance the start-up costs for cannabis establishments.
6 (6) The general assembly also finds that individuals who have resided in areas of high
7 poverty suffer negative consequences, including barriers to entry in employment, business
8 ownership, housing, health, and long-term financial well-being.
9 (7) The general assembly also finds and declares that promotion of business ownership by
10 individuals who have resided in areas of high poverty and high enforcement of cannabis-related
11 laws furthers a more equitable cannabis industry.
12 (8) Therefore, in the interest of mitigating the harms resulting from the enforcement of
13 cannabis-related laws, the general assembly finds and declares that a social equity program should
14 offer, among other things, business assistance and license application benefits to individuals most
15 directly and adversely impacted by the enforcement of cannabis-related laws who are interested in
16 establishing or participating in a cannabis business entity.
17 (9) Therefore, in the interest of mitigating the emotional, psychological, and financial
18 harms resulting from the enforcement of cannabis-related laws, the general assembly finds and
19 declares that some revenue from the cannabis industry should be returned to disproportionately
20 impacted areas.

22 within the general fund, separate and apart from other state monies subject to appropriation. This
23 fund shall be used for the following purposes:

8 disabled residents in disproportionately impacted areas as determined by the commission
9 (b) There is created in the state treasury within the general fund, a fund which shall be held
10 separate and apart from all other state monies, to be known as the social equity assistance fund.

6 pursuant to § 21-28.11-27 and/or other applicable law.
7 (c) “Conviction” as used throughout this chapter shall have the same meaning as set forth
8 in § 21-28.6-6(g).

19 revoked, solely or in part, because of a prior or subsequent possession of cannabis or marijuana
20 offense conviction of a crime or crimes unless the underlying crime or crimes substantially relate
21 to the occupation to which the license or registration applies. Any other state law to the contrary
22 will be superseded by this provision.
23 (f) A person who has been convicted of a crime may be disqualified to practice, pursue or
24 engage in any business activity licensed by the commission pursuant to this chapter or chapter 28.6
25 of this title if the commission determines that the circumstances of the conviction are substantially
26 related to the occupation for which the license or registration is sought. In determining if a

28 commission shall consider:
29 (1) The state’s legitimate interest in protecting the property and the safety and welfare of
30 specific individuals or the general public;
31 (2) The relationship of the crime or crimes to the ability, capacity, and fitness required to

LC001964 - Page 8 of 16

1 had past contact with the criminal justice system.
2 (g) A person who has been convicted of a crime or crimes that substantially relates to the
3 occupation for which a license is sought may not be automatically disqualified from the occupation
4 if the person can establish by competent evidence, satisfactory in the discretion of the commission,
5 of sufficient rehabilitation and present fitness to perform the duties of the occupation for which the
6 license is sought. The commission shall consider the time elapsed since the conviction when
7 determining sufficient rehabilitation, specifically, convictions issued prior to five (5) years before
8 the date of the application shall be deemed evidence of sufficient rehabilitation, as well as any
9 evidence presented by the applicant regarding:
10 (1) Completion of a period of at least two (2) years after release from imprisonment, or at
11 least two (2) years after the sentencing date for a probation sentence or suspended sentence not
12 accompanied by incarceration, without subsequent conviction or pending criminal charge;
13 (2) The nature, seriousness, and relevance of the crime or crimes for which convicted;
14 (3) All circumstances relative to the crime or crimes, including mitigating circumstances
15 surrounding the commission of the crime or crimes;
16 (4) The age of the person at the time the crime or crimes were committed;
17 (5) Claims that the criminal record information is in error or inadmissible; and
18 (6) All other competent evidence of rehabilitation and present fitness presented, including,
19 but not limited to, letters of reference by persons who have been in contact with the applicant since
20 the applicant’s release from any state or federal correctional institution.
21 (h) The following criminal records may shall not be used in connection with any
22 application for a license or registration submitted pursuant to the provisions of this chapter:
23 (1) Juvenile adjudications;
24 (2) Records of arrest not followed by a conviction;
25 (3) Convictions that have been, pursuant to law, annulled or expunged;
26 (4) Misdemeanor convictions for which no jail sentence can be imposed; or
27 (5) A conviction that does not substantially relate to the occupation for which the license
28 or registration is sought, as determined by subsection (f) of this section.
29 (i) If the commission intends to deny, suspend, or revoke an occupational license, permit,
30 or registration solely or in part because of the individual’s prior conviction of a crime that is
31 determined to be substantially related to the occupation for which the license or registration applies,
32 the commission shall notify the individual in writing of the following prior to the final decision:
33 (1) The specific conviction(s) that forms the basis for the potential denial, suspension, or
34 revocation and the rationale for deeming the conviction substantially related to the occupation or
LC001964 - Page 9 of 16

1 activity;
2 (2) A copy of the conviction history report, if any, on which the commission relies;
3 (3) A statement that the applicant may provide evidence of mitigation or rehabilitation, as
4 described in subsection (g) of this section; and
5 (4) Instructions on how to respond to the potential denial, suspension, or revocation.
6 (j) After receiving the notice of potential denial, suspension, or revocation, the individual
7 shall have thirty (30) business days to respond.
8 (k) If the commission denies, suspends, or revokes a license or registration solely or in part
9 because of the applicant’s substantially related conviction, the commission shall issue a final
10 written decision that addresses the following:
11 (1) The specific conviction(s) that form the basis for the denial, suspension, or revocation
12 and the rationale for deeming the conviction(s) substantially related to the occupation or activity;
13 (2) A copy of the conviction history report, if any, on which the commission relies;
14 (3) The process for appealing the decision in accordance with chapter 35 of title 42; and
15 (4) The earliest date the person may reapply for license or registration which shall not be
16 longer than two (2) years from the date of the final decision.
17 (l) Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, except as otherwise provided
18 in this chapter, any prior conviction for a crime that has been decriminalized, or is eligible for
19 expungement pursuant to the provisions of this chapter cannot serve as grounds, either solely or in
20 part, for denial, suspension or revocation of a license or registration pursuant to this chapter.
21 (m) The commission shall adopt rules and regulations establishing standards and
22 procedures consistent with the provisions of this section.
23 21-28.11-31. Social equity assistance program and fund.
24 (a)(1) Findings. The general assembly finds that additional efforts are needed to reduce
25 barriers to ownership and/or participation in the cannabis industry for individuals and communities
26 most adversely impacted by the enforcement of cannabis-related laws.
27 (2) In the interest of establishing a legal cannabis industry that is equitable and accessible
28 to those most adversely impacted by the enforcement of cannabis-related laws, the general
29 assembly finds and declares that a social equity program should be established.
30 (3) The general assembly also finds and declares that individuals who have been arrested
31 or incarcerated due to cannabis related laws suffer long-lasting negative consequences, including
32 impacts to employment, business ownership, housing, health, and long-term financial well-being.
33 (4) The general assembly also finds and declares that family members, especially children,
34 and communities of those who have been arrested or incarcerated due to cannabis related laws,
LC001964 - Page 10 of 16

1 suffer from emotional, psychological, and financial harms as a result of such arrests or
2 incarcerations.
3 (5) Furthermore, the general assembly finds and declares that certain communities have
4 disproportionately suffered the harms of enforcement of cannabis-related laws. Those communities
5 face greater difficulties accessing capital to finance the start-up costs for cannabis establishments.
6 (6) The general assembly also finds that individuals who have resided in areas of high
7 poverty suffer negative consequences, including barriers to entry in employment, business
8 ownership, housing, health, and long-term financial well-being.
9 (7) The general assembly also finds and declares that promotion of business ownership by
10 individuals who have resided in areas of high poverty and high enforcement of cannabis-related
11 laws furthers a more equitable cannabis industry.
12 (8) Therefore, in the interest of mitigating the harms resulting from the enforcement of
13 cannabis-related laws, the general assembly finds and declares that a social equity program should
14 offer, among other things, business assistance and license application benefits to individuals most
15 directly and adversely impacted by the enforcement of cannabis-related laws who are interested in
16 establishing or participating in a cannabis business entity.
17 (9) Therefore, in the interest of mitigating the emotional, psychological, and financial
18 harms resulting from the enforcement of cannabis-related laws, the general assembly finds and
19 declares that some revenue from the cannabis industry should be returned to disproportionately
20 impacted areas.
21 (i) A dedicated disproportionately impacted areas investment fund shall be established
22 within the general fund, separate and apart from other state monies subject to appropriation. This
23 fund shall be used for the following purposes:
24 (A) To provide funding for the development of public housing including, grants for
25 beautification initiatives, development of affordable housing, tenant-led housing co-ops,
26 emergency rent assistance, legal defense fund, rent-to-own programs, and homeownership
27 programs in disproportionately impacted areas as determined by the commission.
28 (B) To provide funding for early and public education including, funding to social workers
29 and mental health counselors in public schools, youth development programs, nonprofits geared
30 towards youth and education, expanding access to high-quality Pre-k, expanding the budget for
31 public schools, facility upgrades including, tech, theater, sports, STEM, and arts programs after-
32 school and extracurricular programs, scholarships for college tuition and vocational trainings,
33 internship stipends, early childhood and out-of-school time (OST) programs focused on equitable
34 access to early learning opportunities, academic support, enrichment activities, social-emotional
LC001964 - Page 11 of 16

1 learning (SEL) and workforce development, parent and caregiver education program especially for
2 parents who were previously incarcerated, and teacher recruitment and retention programs in
3 disproportionately impacted areas as determined by the commission.
4 (C) To provide funding for health subsidies including, improving and establishing clinics
5 and mobile health units, mental health treatment, safe-use sites, maternal and child health services,
6 upkeep and development of community gardens, food education and nutrition classes, sexual health
7 education and resources, health literacy programs, and in-home health services for elderly and
8 disabled residents in disproportionately impacted areas as determined by the commission
9 (b) There is created in the state treasury within the general fund, a fund which shall be held
10 separate and apart from all other state monies, to be known as the social equity assistance fund.
11 The social equity assistance fund, subject to appropriation, shall be exclusively used for the
12 following purposes A dedicated social equity assistance fund shall be established within the general
13 fund, separate and apart from other state monies subject to appropriation. This fund shall be used
14 for the following purposes:
15 (1) To provide grants to approved social equity applicants to pay for ordinary and necessary
16 expenses to establish and/or operate a cannabis establishment, and to also further promote the goals
17 of this chapter, including without limitation, job training and workforce development, mentoring
18 services and technical assistance;
19 (2) To support the waiver or reduction of application and licensing fees pursuant to this
20 section for social equity applicants; and
21 (3) To implement and administer programming for restorative justice, jail diversion, drug
22 rehabilitation and education workforce development for jobs related to cannabis cultivation,
23 transportation, distribution and sales.
24 (c) The social equity assistance fund shall be subject to appropriation. The fund shall
25 consist of all monies received on account of the state as a result of application for, and licensing of,
26 individuals and entities pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, exclusive of licensing fees paid
27 pursuant to the provisions of chapter 28.6 of this title. Additionally, except as otherwise provided,
28 the fund shall consist of all administrative penalties received for violations of this chapter, except
29 tax violations and interest earned on balances in the fund and disproportionately impacted areas
30 investment fund shall be subject to appropriation. Both funds shall consist of all monies received
31 on account of the state as a result of application for, and licensing of, individuals and entities
32 pursuant to the provisions of this chapter; as well as a portion of the state cannabis excise tax as
33 determined in § 44-70-5. Furthermore, both funds shall consist of all civil penalties received for
34 violations of this chapter, including tax violations and interest earned on balances in the funds.

17 fees associated with acquiring a license to operate a cannabis establishment, pursuant to rules and
18 regulations promulgated by the commission in consultation with the cannabis advisory board.
19 (2) If the commission determines that an applicant who applied as a social equity applicant
20 is not eligible for social equity status, the applicant shall be provided an additional ten (10) days to
21 provide alternative evidence that the applicant qualifies as a social equity applicant. Alternatively,
22 the applicant may pay all required fees and be considered as a non-social equity applicant. If the
23 applicant cannot do either, then any application fee shall be returned and the application process
24 shall be terminated.
25 (g) Transfers of cannabis establishment licenses awarded to a social equity applicant are
26 subject to all other provisions of this chapter, and applicable law; provided however, that a license

LC001964 - Page 13 of 16

1 reducing or eliminating any identified barriers to entry, including without limitation, access to
2 capital.
