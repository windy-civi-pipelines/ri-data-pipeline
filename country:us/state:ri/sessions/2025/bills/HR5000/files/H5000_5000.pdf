1 WHEREAS, It is with great sadness that this House of Representatives has learned of the
2 passing of President Jimmy Carter, who served our country as the 39th President of the United
3 States from January 20th of 1977 to January 20th of 1981; and
4 WHEREAS, As the longest-lived President in United States history, last year marked the
5 100th Birthday of James Earl Carter Jr., who was born and raised in Plains, Georgia on October
6 1, 1924; and
7 WHEREAS, President Carter, born in the deep south, was a small-town peanut farmer.
8 He graduated from the United States Naval Academy and subsequently joined the U.S. Navy's
9 submarine service. He continued his service to our country in the Georgia State Senate until
10 elected as the 76th Governor of Georgia in 1971; and
11 WHEREAS, During President Carter's administration, the country faced many trials
12 through myriad events including the Iranian hostage crisis, continuing economic distress, high
13 unemployment and inflation, and enjoyed many successes including the Camp David Accords,
14 Panama Canal treaties, full diplomatic recognition to China, the creation of two Cabinet-level
15 departments â€” Energy and Education, and the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act,
16 to name but a few of his accomplishments; and
17 WHEREAS, The years following Jimmy Carter's term as President demonstrated the
18 depth and substance of his unselfish love for peace, human rights, principles, faith and humility,
19 and in 2002, for a lifetime promoting human rights and his extraordinary efforts to resolve

1 conflicts around the world, President Carter was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize; and
2 WHEREAS, President Carter had been married to the love of his life, Rosalynn, for more
3 than 77 years and was the father of Jack, Chip, Jeff and Amy, and the grandfather of 12
4 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren; and
5 WHEREAS, During his post-presidency years, President Carter and his wife resided in
6 the home they had built in 1961, and in addition to his peace initiatives and endeavors, he wrote
7 33 books on topics ranging from war to woodworking, won three Grammy Awards for his
8 recordings of audio versions of his books, and annually helped build homes with Habitat for
9 Humanity. He and his wife also founded the Carter Center at Emory University in Atlanta which
10 became the base for his peacemaking and other humanitarian missions; and
11 WHEREAS, There is little doubt that President Jimmy Carter's integrity and common
12 sense set a standard for excellence in public service that inspired this nation and he will forever
13 be remembered for his extraordinary peace initiatives and deep commitment to serving the
14 citizens of the United States and the world community; now, therefore be it
15 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
16 expresses our deepest sympathies on the passing of President Jimmy Carter; and be it further
17 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
