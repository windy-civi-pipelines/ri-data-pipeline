8 to an agreement effective for the life of the individual or for a period in excess of one year, including
9 mutually terminable contracts, and (ii) in consideration of the payment of an entrance fee and/or

13 pursuant to arrangement specifically offered to residents of the facility or participants of a
14 continuing care at home program.
15 (2) "Continuing care at home program" means a membership-based program that provides

1 providing the care. Such items may include, but are not limited to, food, shelter, nursing care, drugs,

15 (iii) The consequences if the spouse does not meet the requirements for entry.
16 (8) Provide that the provider shall not cancel any continuing care contract with any resident
17 without good cause. Good cause shall be limited to:
18 (i) Proof that the resident is a danger to himself, herself, or others;
19 (ii) Nonpayment by the resident of a monthly or periodic fee;
20 (iii) Repeated conduct by the resident that interferes with other residents’ quiet enjoyment
21 of the facility; or
22 (iv) Persistent refusal to comply with reasonable written rules and regulations of the
23 facility. If a provider seeks to cancel a contract and terminate a resident’s occupancy within a
24 facility or participation in a continuing care at home program, the provider shall give the resident
25 written notice of, and a reasonable opportunity to cure within a reasonable period, whatever conduct
26 is alleged to warrant the cancellation of the agreement. Nothing herein shall operate to relieve the

34 of the provider. When more than one individual shares a residential unit, the contract shall set forth
LC002174 - Page 7 of 11
1 the effect that the death of one resident will have on the agreement between the other resident or
2 residents and the provider.
3 (11) Provide for at least thirty (30) days’ advance notice to the resident, before any change
4 in fees, charges, or the scope of care or services may be effective, except for changes required by
5 state or federal assistance programs.
6 (12) Provide that charges for care paid in one lump sum shall not be increased or changed
7 during the duration of the agreed upon care, except for changes required by state or federal
8 assistance programs.

10 forfeiture, within seven (7) days after making an initial deposit or executing the contract. A resident
11 shall not be required to move into the facility designated in the contract before the expiration of
12 that seven (7) day period.
13 (c) If a resident dies before occupying the facility or beginning the continuing care at home
14 program, or is precluded through illness, injury, or incapacity from becoming a resident under the
15 terms of the continuing care contract, the contract is automatically rescinded, and the resident or
16 his or her legal representative shall receive a full refund of all money paid to the provider, except
17 those costs specifically incurred by the provider at the request of the resident and set forth in writing
18 in a separate addendum, signed by both parties to the contract.
19 (d) No standard continuing care contract form shall be used in this state until it has been
20 submitted to the department. If the department determines that the contract does not comply with
21 the provisions of this chapter, it shall have the right to take action pursuant to § 23-59-16 to prevent
22 its use. The failure of the department to object to or disapprove of any contract shall not be evidence
23 that the contract does or does not comply with the provisions of this chapter. However,
24 individualized amendments to any standard form need not be filed with the department.
25 23-59-7. Sale or transfer of ownership or change in management.
26 (a) No provider and no person or entity owning a provider shall sell or transfer, directly or
27 indirectly, more than fifty percent (50%) of the ownership of the provider or of a continuing care
28 facility or continuing care at home program without giving the department written notice of the
29 intended sale or transfer at least thirty (30) days prior to the consummation of the sale or transfer.
30 A series of sales or transfers to one person or entity, or one or more entities controlled by one person
31 or entity, consummated within a six (6) month period that constitutes, in the aggregate, a sale or
32 transfer of more than fifty percent (50%) of the ownership of a provider or of a continuing care
33 facility or continuing care at home program shall be subject to the foregoing notice provisions.
34 (b) A provider or continuing care facility or continuing care at home program that shall
LC002174 - Page 8 of 11
1 change its chief executive officer, or its management firm if managed under a contract with a third
2 party, shall promptly notify the department and the residents of each change of chief executive
3 officer or management firm.
4 23-59-11. Right of residents to organize — Meetings.
5 (a) Residents shall have the right of self-organization. No retaliatory conduct shall be
6 permitted against any resident for membership or participation in a residents’ organization. The
7 provider shall be required to provide to the organization a copy of all submissions to the department.
8 (b) The board of directors, its designated representative, or other such governing body of a
9 continuing care facility or continuing care at home program shall hold meetings at least quarterly
10 with the residents or representatives elected by the residents of the continuing care facility or
11 continuing care at home program for the purpose of free discussion of issues relating to the facility
12 or continuing care at home program. Such issues may include income, expenditures, and financial
13 matters as they apply to the facility or continuing care at home program and proposed changes in
14 policies, programs, facilities, and services. Residents shall be entitled to seven (7) days’ notice of
15 each meeting.
16 23-59-12. Civil liability.
17 (a) A person contracting with a provider for continuing care may terminate the continuing
18 care contract, and the provider shall be liable to the person contracting for continuing care for
19 repayment of all fees paid to the provider, facility, or person violating this chapter, together with
20 interest thereon at the legal rate for judgments, court costs, and reasonable attorney’s fees, less the
21 reasonable value of care and lodging provided to the resident prior to the termination of the contract
22 and for damages if after June 18, 1987 the provider or a person acting on the provider’s behalf,
23 with or without actual knowledge of the violation, entered into a contract with the person:
24 (1) For continuing care at a facility or continuing care at home program which has not
25 registered under this chapter;
26 (2) Without having first provided to the person a disclosure statement meeting the
27 requirements of this chapter and not omitting a material fact required to be stated therein or
28 necessary in order to make the statements made therein not misleading, in light of the circumstances
29 under which they are made; or
30 (3) If the contract does not meet the requirements of § 23-59-6.
31 (b) A person who willfully or recklessly aids or abets a provider in any act prohibited by
32 this section shall be liable as set out in subsection (a) of this section.
33 (c) The department shall have no jurisdiction to adjudicate controversies concerning
34 continuing care contracts. A breach of contract shall not be deemed a violation of this chapter.
LC002174 - Page 9 of 11

8 to an agreement effective for the life of the individual or for a period in excess of one year, including
9 mutually terminable contracts, and (ii) in consideration of the payment of an entrance fee and/or

13 pursuant to arrangement specifically offered to residents of the facility or participants of a
14 continuing care at home program.
15 (2) "Continuing care at home program" means a membership-based program that provides

8 for one year of residency shall not be considered to be an entrance fee.
9 (4)(5) “Facility” means the place or places in which a person undertakes to provide
10 continuing care to an individual.

12 or continuing care at home program. Such issues may include income, expenditures, and financial
