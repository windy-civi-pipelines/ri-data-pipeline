20 been bound to deliver the personal property. If the other party does not claim the balance of the
21 proceeds within two (2) years of the date of the sale, it shall eschew to the state.
22 (j)(k) The owner shall be liable for damages caused by failure to comply with the
23 requirements for sale under this section and in case of willful violation is liable for conversion.
24 (k)(l) The owner shall not be liable for identity theft or other harm resulting from the misuse
25 of information contained within the contents of the occupant’s storage space, which are sold or
26 otherwise disposed of to satisfy the owner’s lien.
