Introduced By: Senators Ciccone, Patalano, Burke, LaMountain, and Dimitri
Date Introduced: January 31, 2025
Referred To: Senate Labor & Gaming
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Sections 28-7-2, 28-7-3, 28-7-9, 28-7-21 and 28-7-22 of the General Laws in
2 Chapter 28-7 entitled "Labor Relations Act" are hereby amended to read as follows:
3 28-7-2. Policy of chapter.
4 (a) The economic necessity for employees to possess full freedom of association, actual
5 liberty of contract, and bargaining power equal to that of their employers, who are frequently
6 organized in corporate or other forms of association, has long been sanctioned by public opinion,
7 and recognized and affirmed by legislatures and the highest courts. As the modern industrial system
8 has progressed, there has developed between and among employees and employers an ever greater
9 economic interdependence and community of interest which have become matters of vital public
10 concern. Employers and employees have recognized that the peaceable practice and wholesome
11 development of that relationship and interest are materially aided by the general adoption and
12 advancement of the procedure and practice of bargaining collectively as between equals. It is in the
13 public interest that equality of bargaining power be established and maintained. It is likewise
14 recognized that the denial by some employers of the right of employees freely to organize and the
15 resultant refusal to accept the procedure of collective bargaining substantially and adversely affect
16 the interest of employees, other employers, and the public in general. This denial creates variations
17 and instability in competitive wage rates and working conditions within and between industries and
18 between employees and employers engaged in those industries, and by depressing the purchasing
19 power of wage earners and the profits of business, tends to:
1 (1) Produce and aggravate recurrent business depressions;
2 (2) Increase the disparity between production and consumption;
3 (3) Create unemployment with its attendant dangers to the health, peace and morale of the
4 people; and
5 (4) Increase public and private expenditures for relief of the needy and the unemployed.
6 (b) When some employers deny the right of employees to full freedom of association and
7 organization, and refuse to recognize the practice and procedure of collective bargaining, their
8 actions lead to strikes, lockouts, and other forms of industrial strife and unrest which are inimical
9 to the public safety and welfare, and frequently endanger the public health.
10 (c) Experience has proved that protection by law of the right of employees to organize and
11 bargain collectively removes certain recognized sources of industrial strife and unrest, encourages
12 practices fundamental to the friendly adjustment of industrial disputes arising out of differences as
13 to wages, hours, or other working conditions, and tends to restore equality of bargaining power
14 between and among employers and employees, thereby advancing the interests of employers as
15 well as employees.
16 (d) In the interpretation and application of this chapter and otherwise, it is declared to be
17 the public policy of the state to encourage the practice and procedure of collective bargaining, and
18 to protect employees, when not already protected by the National Labor Relations Board, 29 U.S.C.
19 §§151-169 in the exercise of full freedom of association, self organization, and designation of
20 representatives of their own choosing for the purposes of collective bargaining, or other mutual aid
21 and protection, free from the interference, restraint, or coercion of their employers.
22 (e) All the provisions of this chapter shall be liberally construed for the accomplishment of
23 this purpose.
24 (f) This chapter shall be deemed an exercise of the police power of the state for the
25 protection of the public welfare, prosperity, health, and peace of the people of the state.
