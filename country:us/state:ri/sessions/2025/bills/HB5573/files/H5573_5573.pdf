12 of title 42 ("2021 act on climate"), and how the project may advance or delay the greenhouse gas
13 emissions reductions set forth therein. The board may also consider other reasonably foreseeable
14 climate change impacts, including other pollutant emissions known to have negative health
15 impacts, predicted sea level rise, coastal and inland flooding, and other disproportionate adverse
16 effects on a specific geographical area.
17 Where applicable these descriptions and analysis shall include a review of current
18 independent, scientific research pertaining to electric and magnetic fields (EMF). The review shall
19 provide data assessing potential health risks associated with EMF exposure. For the purposes of
20 this chapter “prudent avoidance” shall refer to measures to be implemented in order to protect the
21 public from EMF exposure.
22 (4) All studies and forecasts, complete with the information, data, methodology, and
23 assumptions on which they are based, on which the applicant intends to rely in showing the need
24 for the proposed facility under the statewide master construction plan submitted annually.
25 (5) Complete detail as to the estimated construction cost of the proposed facility, the
26 projected maintenance and operation costs, estimated costs to the community such as safety and
27 public health issues, storm damage and power outages, estimated costs to businesses and
28 homeowners due to power outages, the estimated unit cost of energy to be produced by the proposed
29 facility, and expected methods of financing the facility.
30 (6) A complete life-cycle management plan for the proposed facility, including measures
31 for protecting the public health and safety and the environment during the facility’s operations,
