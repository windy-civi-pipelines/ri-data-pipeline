STATE OF RHODE ISLAND
Introduced By: Representatives Handy, Shekarchi, Blazejewski, Chippendale, Ajello,

Date Introduced: May 01, 2025
Referred To: House read and passed
1 WHEREAS, National Therapy Animal Day was created to recognize the exceptional
2 dogs, cats, and other animals that bring comfort, joy, and healing to those in need; and
3 WHEREAS, Animal-assisted therapy is based on the unique bond that exists between
4 human beings and animals. Dogs and cats are most commonly used in pet therapy, however, fish,
5 guinea pigs, horses, and other animals are also used depending on the therapeutic goals of a
6 person's treatment plan; and
7 WHEREAS, There are numerous therapeutic applications that animals can provide
8 including improvement in one's self-image and sense of competence, nurturing a sense of
9 responsibility, expressing feelings and distress via the animal and developing one's curiosity and
10 motivation to learn, not to mention the endless hours of fun, warmth, learning, and love; and
11 WHEREAS, Many animals main goal is to love and please the humans in their lives, and
12 often times, total strangers. Animals frequently have the innate ability to detect emotions in
13 people from clues which are invisible to humans and many will instinctively comfort a person
14 whom they sense is in distress and in need of some extra attention; and
15 WHEREAS, Whether professionally supervised or the casual and spontaneous interaction
16 between loving animals and folks in need, animal therapy is a powerful tool for the treatment and
17 quality of life for many individuals; and
18 WHEREAS, Promoting public awareness for animal therapy is an exciting and effective
19 pathway towards a friendlier, healthier and more peaceful world; now, therefore be it

1 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
2 commemorates "National Therapy Animal Day‚Äù and urges the Director of the Department of
3 Health and Human Services and all the citizens of Rhode Island to continue to appreciate,
4 promote, and advocate for the incomparably life changing and life sustaining benefits of the
5 human companion and animal bond; and be it further
6 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
7 transmit duly certified copies of this resolution to the Director of the Rhode Island Department of
8 Health and Human Services, Paws from the Heart Pet Therapy, and the Windwalker Humane
9 Coalition for Professional Pet Assisted Therapy.
