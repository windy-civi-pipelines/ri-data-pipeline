Date Introduced: February 11, 2025
Referred To: House read and passed
1 WHEREAS, The health and well-being of all children throughout our State are of
2 paramount importance to Rhode Island's families and communities; and
3 WHEREAS, Each year approximately 40,000 babies are born in the United States with a
4 congenital heart defect, beginning their lives with one of more than forty identified forms of
5 congenital heart defects; and
6 WHEREAS, Nearly 1 of every 110 babies born in the United States are born with a
7 congenital heart defect and approximately 25 percent of these children will require at least one
8 invasive surgery in their first year of life to survive; and
9 WHEREAS, Common heart defects include, septal defects, patent ductus arteriosus
10 (PDA), coarctation of the aorta (COA), tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), transposition of the great
11 arteries (TGA) and hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) as well as many others; and
12 WHEREAS, Congenital heart defects are among our state's most common birth defects
13 and they are often fatal due to their seriousness, a lack of effective medical intervention options,
14 and the limited availability of infant donor hearts; and
15 WHEREAS, The origins and symptoms of congenital heart defects are becoming more
16 readily identifiable and the range of surgical options are expanding continuously thanks to
17 doctors' and scientists' diligent research efforts and field experiences that extend our body of
18 knowledge every day; and
19 WHEREAS, There is much to learn about the causes of and effective treatments for

1 congenital heart defects, and it is important for parents, pediatricians, and nurses to recognize the
2 warning signs associated with congenital heart defects among newborns so they may provide
3 proper treatment as early as possible; and
4 WHEREAS, Many of Rhode Island's families and communities are directly or indirectly
5 affected by infant illness and death caused by congenital heart defects; now, therefore be it
6 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
7 proclaims February 7th through the 14th of 2025, to be "Congenital Heart Defect Awareness
8 Week" in our State. We furthermore urge all the citizens of the State to join us in the observance
9 of this event and to recognize and applaud the efforts of doctors and scientists everywhere who
10 work diligently to solve life's medical mysteries and to improve the quality of life for us all; and
11 be it further
12 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
13 transmit duly certified copies of this resolution to Norelys Consuegra, and the American Heart
