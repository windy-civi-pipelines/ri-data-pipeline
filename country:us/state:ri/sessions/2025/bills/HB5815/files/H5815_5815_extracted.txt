5 discretion, determine the amount of financial support being granted, considering the demonstrated
6 needs of the intervenor and the complexity of the proceeding. The commission may, at the
7 commission’s sole discretion:
8 (i) Upon the petition of a prospective grantee, award a grant exceeding fifty thousand

13 complex issues have arisen in the proceeding since the time the grant application was submitted
14 pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.
15 (6) The commission may consider the potential for intervenors to share costs through
16 collaborative efforts with other parties to a proceeding as part of determining the amount of funding
17 awarded to any prospective grantee and such intervenors may be expected to reduce duplicative
18 costs to the extent possible in instances where the position or positions of multiple intervenors
19 align.
20 (7) The aggregate grant funding for any individual proceeding shall not exceed one hundred
21 thousand dollars ($100,000). Where the aggregate amount of funding being requested exceeds one
22 hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), funding shall be allocated to prospective grantees based on
23 their relative financial hardship. The commission may, upon a determination of good cause, provide
24 funding exceeding one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) for any individual commission or
25 board proceeding.
26 SECTION 2. This act shall take effect On September 1, 2025.

17 applicant’s proposed actions as set forth in the application if necessary to enable the applicant to
18 initiate, continue, or complete the proposed actions.
19 (iii) If upon completion of the proceeding and submittal of the grantee’s report to the
20 commission, the grantee’s budget exceeds the actual spending, such excess funds shall be returned
21 to the intervenor compensation special fund.
22 (3) The commission shall encourage grant making to nonprofits representing
23 environmental justice communities and communities with the highest energy burdens.
24 (4) Any computer model that is the basis for any intervenor compensation shall be available
25 to, and subject to verification by, the commission and parties to the hearing or proceedings to the
26 extent necessary for cross-examination or rebuttal.
27 (5) The computation of a compensation award shall take into consideration the market rates
28 paid to persons of comparable training and experience who offer similar services. The
29 compensation awarded shall not, in any case, exceed the comparable market rate for services paid
30 by the commission or the public utility, whichever is greater, to persons of comparable training and
31 experience who are offering similar services.
32 (6) The commission may audit the records and books of the intervenor to the extent

LC001304 - Page 5 of 8

1 obstruct the orderly and timely fulfillment of the commission's responsibilities.
2 (8) The commission may require public utilities to pay into the intervenor compensation
3 special fund.
4 (9) The award shall be paid out of the intervenor compensation special fund.
5 (10) Participation by a customer that materially supplements, complements, or contributes
6 to the presentation of another party, including the commission staff, shall be fully eligible for
7 compensation if the participation makes a substantial contribution to a commission order or
8 decision, and if this participation was approved beforehand for the grant.
9 (11) Within thirty (30) days after the completion of a proceeding, each grantee shall submit
10 to the commission a report that:
11 (i) Identifies the use of the funds during the proceeding;
12 (ii) The substantial contribution provided by its participation; and
13 (iii) A demonstration that its participation and the use of the funding did not cause a delay
14 in the proceeding. Upon this submittal, any adjustments to the difference between the original grant
15 given and the actual spending that occurred will be made.
16 (12) Any grants awarded pursuant to this section shall be used only in proceedings before
17 the commission or the siting board, and not for any judicial appeal of such agencies’ final decisions.
18 (d) Intervenor compensation special fund.
19 (1) There is established the intervenor compensation special fund within the commission,
20 into which shall be deposited any funds so designated by the commission, and from which awards
21 for intervenor compensation under this section may be paid.
22 (2) The fund shall consist of the following sources:
23 (i) Sums the general assembly may appropriate;
24 (ii) Monies received from federal or state entities, including bond funds or court awards;
25 (iii) Fees levied by the commission or siting board;
26 (iv) Monies received from any private donor for the intervenor compensation special fund;
27 (v) Any interest earned on monies in the fund; and
28 (vi) Annual assessment on electric and gas distribution companies.
29 (3) An annual assessment on electric and gas distribution companies shall occur:
30 (i) If the total funds available would result in the special fund having a balance below a
31 reasonable annual budget as set by the commission;
32 (ii) If the general assembly appropriates funds, the utility shall be assessed up to an equal
33 amount as the appropriation, in order that the fund shall be capped at one hundred fifty percent

LC001304 - Page 6 of 8

1 (4) Such an assessment shall be proposed prior to April 1 of each year, and go into effect
2 on April 1 of each year, or other such date as approved by the commission.
3 (5) A grant awarded pursuant to this section shall not exceed fifty thousand dollars
4 ($50,000) per proceeding for any single awardee. The commission shall, at the commission’s sole
5 discretion, determine the amount of financial support being granted, considering the demonstrated
6 needs of the intervenor and the complexity of the proceeding. The commission may, at the
7 commission’s sole discretion:
8 (i) Upon the petition of a prospective grantee, award a grant exceeding fifty thousand
9 dollars ($50,000) only upon a demonstration of good cause, including the complexity of the
10 proceeding in which the grantee is intervening; and
11 (ii) Upon the petition of a prospective grantee, provide grant funding in addition to the
12 funding initially requested under subsection (c) of this section upon a showing that new, novel or
13 complex issues have arisen in the proceeding since the time the grant application was submitted
14 pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.
15 (6) The commission may consider the potential for intervenors to share costs through
16 collaborative efforts with other parties to a proceeding as part of determining the amount of funding
17 awarded to any prospective grantee and such intervenors may be expected to reduce duplicative
18 costs to the extent possible in instances where the position or positions of multiple intervenors
19 align.
20 (7) The aggregate grant funding for any individual proceeding shall not exceed one hundred
21 thousand dollars ($100,000). Where the aggregate amount of funding being requested exceeds one
22 hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), funding shall be allocated to prospective grantees based on
23 their relative financial hardship. The commission may, upon a determination of good cause, provide
24 funding exceeding one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) for any individual commission or
25 board proceeding.
26 SECTION 2. This act shall take effect On September 1, 2025.
