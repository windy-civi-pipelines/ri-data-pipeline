10 our community; and
11 WHEREAS, The 2023-2024 United Way of Rhode Island Community Impact Report
12 stated that more than 190,000 requests for help were received by 2-1-1 with the majority focused

14 WHEREAS, 2-1-1 plays a critical communications role during natural disasters or other
15 state crises; including floods and winter snow storms; and
