1 WHEREAS, Autism is a neurological condition that can profoundly affect a person's

11 WHEREAS, Over the past several years, significant progress has been made in the areas
12 of research, diagnostic practices, and therapies for individuals with Autism; and
13 WHEREAS, A variety of causes, including environmental toxins and genetics, are all
14 being studied in relation to Autism, but to date, there is no identifiable cause for autism; and
15 WHEREAS, Research indicates that early, intensive, sustained, and appropriate
16 intervention can result in significant improvements in the quality of life, level of independent
17 functioning, and reduction of public costs associated with Autism; now, therefore be it
18 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
19 proclaims April of 2025, to be "Autism Awareness Month" in the State of Rhode Island; and be it

6 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
7 transmit a duly certified copy of this resolution to the Autism Society of Rhode Island Chapter.
