9 (b) A provision in an account agreement or other record that substantially excuses liability
10 or substantially limits remedies for failure to perform an obligation under this chapter is not
11 sufficient to vary the effect of a provision of this chapter.
12 (c) If a beneficiary is a party to an account agreement, the bank and the depositor may
13 amend the agreement without the consent of the beneficiary only if the agreement expressly permits
14 the amendment.
15 (d) If a beneficiary is not a party to an account agreement and the bank and the depositor
16 know the beneficiary has knowledge of the agreement's terms, the bank and the depositor may
17 amend the agreement without the consent of the beneficiary only if the amendment does not
18 adversely and materially affect a payment right of the beneficiary.
19 (e) If a beneficiary is not a party to an account agreement and the bank and the depositor
20 do not know whether the beneficiary has knowledge of the agreement's terms, the bank and the
21 depositor may amend the agreement without the consent of the beneficiary only if the amendment
22 is made in good faith.
23 19-35-5. Requirements for special deposit.
24 A deposit is a special deposit if it is:
25 (1) A deposit of funds in a bank under an account agreement;
26 (2) For the benefit of at least two (2) beneficiaries, one or more of which may be a
27 depositor;
28 (3) Denominated in a medium of exchange that is currently authorized or adopted by a

34 agreement from the time the special deposit is created in the account agreement until termination
LC001239 - Page 4 of 9
1 of the special deposit.
2 (b) If, before termination of the special deposit, the bank or a court determines the special
3 deposit no longer satisfies subsection (a) of this section, §§ 19-35-8 through 19-35-11 cease to
4 apply to any funds deposited in the special deposit after the special deposit ceases to satisfy
5 subsection (a) of this section.
6 (c) If, before termination of a special deposit, the bank determines the special deposit no
7 longer satisfies subsection (a) of this section, the bank may take action it believes is necessary under
8 the circumstances, including terminating the special deposit.
9 19-35-7. Payment to beneficiary by bank.
10 (a) Unless the account agreement provides otherwise, the bank is obligated to pay a
11 beneficiary if there are sufficient actually and finally collected funds in the balance of the special
12 deposit.
13 (b) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, the obligation to pay the beneficiary
14 is excused if the funds available in the special deposit are insufficient to cover such payment.
15 (c) Unless the account agreement provides otherwise, if the funds available in the special
16 deposit are insufficient to cover an obligation to pay a beneficiary, a beneficiary may elect to be
17 paid the funds that are available or, if there is more than one beneficiary, a pro rata share of the
18 funds available. Payment to the beneficiary making the election under this subsection discharges
19 the bank's obligation to pay a beneficiary and does not constitute an accord and satisfaction with
20 respect to another person obligated to the beneficiary.
21 (d) Unless the account agreement provides otherwise, the obligation of the bank obligated
22 to pay a beneficiary is immediately due and payable.
23 (e) The bank may discharge its obligation under this section by:
24 (1) Crediting another transaction account of the beneficiary; or
25 (2) Taking other action that:
26 (i) Is permitted under the account agreement for the bank to obtain a discharge; or
27 (ii) Otherwise would constitute a discharge under law.
28 (f) If the bank obligated to pay a beneficiary has incurred an obligation to discharge the
29 obligation of another person, the obligation of the other person is discharged if action by the bank
30 under subsection (e) of this section would constitute a discharge of the obligation of the other person
31 under law that determines whether an obligation is satisfied.
32 19-35-8. Property interest of depositor or beneficiary.
33 (a) Neither a depositor nor a beneficiary has a property interest in a special deposit.
34 (b) Any property interest with respect to a special deposit is only in the right to receive
LC001239 - Page 5 of 9
1 payment if the bank is obligated to pay a beneficiary and not in the special deposit itself. Any
2 property interest under this subsection is determined by this chapter.
3 19-35-9. When creditor process is enforceable against bank.
4 (a) Subject to subsection (b) of this section, creditor process with respect to a special
5 deposit is not enforceable against the bank holding the special deposit.
6 (b) Creditor process is enforceable against the bank holding a special deposit with respect
7 to an amount the bank is obligated to pay a beneficiary or a depositor if the process:
8 (1) Is served on the bank;
9 (2) Provides sufficient information to permit the bank to identify the depositor or the
10 beneficiary from the bank's books and records; and
11 (3) Gives the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on the process.
12 (c) Creditor process served on a bank before it is enforceable against the bank under
13 subsection (b) of this section does not create a right of the creditor against the bank or a duty of the
14 bank to the creditor. Rhode Island general laws shall determine whether creditor process creates a
15 lien enforceable against the beneficiary on a contingent interest of a beneficiary, including a
16 depositor as a beneficiary, even if not enforceable against the bank.
17 19-35-10. Injunction or similar relief.
18 A court may enjoin, or grant similar relief that would have the effect of enjoining, a bank
19 from paying a depositor or beneficiary only if payment would constitute a material fraud or
20 facilitate a material fraud with respect to a special deposit.
21 19-35-11. Recoupment or set off.
22 (a) Except as provided in subsections (b) or (c) of this section, a bank may not exercise a
23 right of recoupment or set off against a special deposit.
24 (b) An account agreement may authorize the bank to debit the special deposit:
25 (1) When the bank becomes obligated to pay a beneficiary, in an amount that does not
26 exceed the amount necessary to discharge the obligation;
27 (2) For a fee assessed by the bank that relates to an overdraft in the special deposit account;
28 (3) For costs incurred by the bank that relate directly to the special deposit; or
29 (4) To reverse an earlier credit posted by the bank to the balance of the special deposit
30 account, if the reversal occurs under an event or circumstance warranted under Rhode Island
31 general laws governing mistake and restitution.
32 (c) The bank holding a special deposit may exercise a right of recoupment or set off against
33 an obligation to pay a beneficiary, even if the bank funds payment from the special deposit.
34 19-35-12. Duties and liability of bank.
LC001239 - Page 6 of 9
1 (a) A bank does not have a fiduciary duty to any person with respect to a special deposit.
2 (b) When the bank holding a special deposit becomes obligated to pay a beneficiary, a
3 debtor-creditor relationship arises between the bank and beneficiary.
4 (c) The bank holding a special deposit has a duty to a beneficiary to comply with the
5 account agreement as set forth in this chapter.
6 (d) If the bank holding a special deposit does not comply with the account agreement as
7 set forth in this chapter, the bank is liable to a depositor or beneficiary only for damages proximately
8 caused by the noncompliance. Except as provided by Rhode Island general laws, the bank is not
9 liable for consequential, special, or punitive damages.
10 (e) The bank holding a special deposit may rely on records presented in compliance with
11 the account agreement to determine whether the bank is obligated to pay a beneficiary.
12 (f) If the account agreement requires payment on presentation of a record, the bank shall
13 determine within a reasonable time whether the record is sufficient to require payment. If the
14 agreement requires action by the bank on presentation of a record, the bank is not liable for relying
15 in good faith on the genuineness of the record if the record appears on its face to be genuine.
16 (g) Unless the account agreement provides otherwise, the bank is not required to determine
17 whether a permissible purpose stated in the agreement continues to exist.
18 19-35-13. Term and termination.
19 (a) Unless otherwise provided in the account agreement, a special deposit terminates five
20 (5) years after the date the special deposit was first funded.
21 (b) Unless otherwise provided in the account agreement, if the bank cannot identify or
22 locate a beneficiary entitled to payment when the special deposit is terminated, and a balance
23 remains in the special deposit, the bank shall pay the balance to the depositor or depositors as a
24 beneficiary or beneficiaries.
25 (c) A bank that pays the remaining balance as provided under subsection (b) of this section
26 has no further obligation with respect to the special deposit.
27 19-35-14. Principles of law and equity.
28 The Rhode Island general laws regarding consumer protection, banking deposits, escheat
29 and abandoned or unclaimed property, equity, contracts, principal and agent, estoppel, fraud,
30 misrepresentation, duress, coercion, mistake, and bankruptcy, supplement this chapter except to the
31 extent that any statute is inconsistent with this chapter.
32 19-35-15. Uniformity of application and construction.
33 In applying and construing this chapter, a court shall consider the promotion of uniformity
34 of the law among jurisdictions that enact it.
LC001239 - Page 7 of 9
1 19-35-16. Transitional provision.
2 This chapter applies to:
3 (1) A special deposit made under an account agreement executed on or after the effective
4 date of this chapter; and

6 if:
7 (i) All parties entitled to amend the agreement agree to make the deposit a special deposit
8 governed by this chapter; and
9 (ii) The special deposit referenced in the amended agreement satisfies § 19-35-5.
10 19-35-17. Severability clause.
11 If a provision of this chapter or its application to a person or circumstance is held invalid,
12 the invalidity does not affect any other provision or application of this chapter that can be given
13 effect without the invalid provision.
14 SECTION 2. This act shall take effect upon passage.

3 deposit no longer satisfies subsection (a) of this section, §§ 19-35-8 through 19-35-11 cease to
4 apply to any funds deposited in the special deposit after the special deposit ceases to satisfy
5 subsection (a) of this section.
6 (c) If, before termination of a special deposit, the bank determines the special deposit no
7 longer satisfies subsection (a) of this section, the bank may take action it believes is necessary under
8 the circumstances, including terminating the special deposit.
9 19-35-7. Payment to beneficiary by bank.
10 (a) Unless the account agreement provides otherwise, the bank is obligated to pay a
11 beneficiary if there are sufficient actually and finally collected funds in the balance of the special
12 deposit.
13 (b) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, the obligation to pay the beneficiary
14 is excused if the funds available in the special deposit are insufficient to cover such payment.
15 (c) Unless the account agreement provides otherwise, if the funds available in the special
16 deposit are insufficient to cover an obligation to pay a beneficiary, a beneficiary may elect to be
17 paid the funds that are available or, if there is more than one beneficiary, a pro rata share of the
18 funds available. Payment to the beneficiary making the election under this subsection discharges
19 the bank's obligation to pay a beneficiary and does not constitute an accord and satisfaction with
20 respect to another person obligated to the beneficiary.
21 (d) Unless the account agreement provides otherwise, the obligation of the bank obligated
22 to pay a beneficiary is immediately due and payable.
23 (e) The bank may discharge its obligation under this section by:
24 (1) Crediting another transaction account of the beneficiary; or
25 (2) Taking other action that:
26 (i) Is permitted under the account agreement for the bank to obtain a discharge; or
27 (ii) Otherwise would constitute a discharge under law.
28 (f) If the bank obligated to pay a beneficiary has incurred an obligation to discharge the
29 obligation of another person, the obligation of the other person is discharged if action by the bank
30 under subsection (e) of this section would constitute a discharge of the obligation of the other person
31 under law that determines whether an obligation is satisfied.
32 19-35-8. Property interest of depositor or beneficiary.
33 (a) Neither a depositor nor a beneficiary has a property interest in a special deposit.
34 (b) Any property interest with respect to a special deposit is only in the right to receive
LC001239 - Page 5 of 9

1 payment if the bank is obligated to pay a beneficiary and not in the special deposit itself. Any
2 property interest under this subsection is determined by this chapter.
3 19-35-9. When creditor process is enforceable against bank.
4 (a) Subject to subsection (b) of this section, creditor process with respect to a special
5 deposit is not enforceable against the bank holding the special deposit.
6 (b) Creditor process is enforceable against the bank holding a special deposit with respect
7 to an amount the bank is obligated to pay a beneficiary or a depositor if the process:
8 (1) Is served on the bank;
9 (2) Provides sufficient information to permit the bank to identify the depositor or the
10 beneficiary from the bank's books and records; and
11 (3) Gives the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on the process.
12 (c) Creditor process served on a bank before it is enforceable against the bank under
13 subsection (b) of this section does not create a right of the creditor against the bank or a duty of the
14 bank to the creditor. Rhode Island general laws shall determine whether creditor process creates a
15 lien enforceable against the beneficiary on a contingent interest of a beneficiary, including a
16 depositor as a beneficiary, even if not enforceable against the bank.
17 19-35-10. Injunction or similar relief.
18 A court may enjoin, or grant similar relief that would have the effect of enjoining, a bank
19 from paying a depositor or beneficiary only if payment would constitute a material fraud or
20 facilitate a material fraud with respect to a special deposit.
21 19-35-11. Recoupment or set off.
22 (a) Except as provided in subsections (b) or (c) of this section, a bank may not exercise a
23 right of recoupment or set off against a special deposit.
24 (b) An account agreement may authorize the bank to debit the special deposit:
25 (1) When the bank becomes obligated to pay a beneficiary, in an amount that does not
26 exceed the amount necessary to discharge the obligation;
27 (2) For a fee assessed by the bank that relates to an overdraft in the special deposit account;
28 (3) For costs incurred by the bank that relate directly to the special deposit; or
29 (4) To reverse an earlier credit posted by the bank to the balance of the special deposit
30 account, if the reversal occurs under an event or circumstance warranted under Rhode Island
31 general laws governing mistake and restitution.
32 (c) The bank holding a special deposit may exercise a right of recoupment or set off against
33 an obligation to pay a beneficiary, even if the bank funds payment from the special deposit.
34 19-35-12. Duties and liability of bank.
LC001239 - Page 6 of 9

1 (a) A bank does not have a fiduciary duty to any person with respect to a special deposit.
2 (b) When the bank holding a special deposit becomes obligated to pay a beneficiary, a
3 debtor-creditor relationship arises between the bank and beneficiary.
4 (c) The bank holding a special deposit has a duty to a beneficiary to comply with the
5 account agreement as set forth in this chapter.
6 (d) If the bank holding a special deposit does not comply with the account agreement as
7 set forth in this chapter, the bank is liable to a depositor or beneficiary only for damages proximately
8 caused by the noncompliance. Except as provided by Rhode Island general laws, the bank is not
9 liable for consequential, special, or punitive damages.
10 (e) The bank holding a special deposit may rely on records presented in compliance with
11 the account agreement to determine whether the bank is obligated to pay a beneficiary.
12 (f) If the account agreement requires payment on presentation of a record, the bank shall
13 determine within a reasonable time whether the record is sufficient to require payment. If the
14 agreement requires action by the bank on presentation of a record, the bank is not liable for relying
15 in good faith on the genuineness of the record if the record appears on its face to be genuine.
16 (g) Unless the account agreement provides otherwise, the bank is not required to determine
17 whether a permissible purpose stated in the agreement continues to exist.
18 19-35-13. Term and termination.
19 (a) Unless otherwise provided in the account agreement, a special deposit terminates five
20 (5) years after the date the special deposit was first funded.
21 (b) Unless otherwise provided in the account agreement, if the bank cannot identify or
22 locate a beneficiary entitled to payment when the special deposit is terminated, and a balance
23 remains in the special deposit, the bank shall pay the balance to the depositor or depositors as a
24 beneficiary or beneficiaries.
25 (c) A bank that pays the remaining balance as provided under subsection (b) of this section
26 has no further obligation with respect to the special deposit.
27 19-35-14. Principles of law and equity.
28 The Rhode Island general laws regarding consumer protection, banking deposits, escheat
29 and abandoned or unclaimed property, equity, contracts, principal and agent, estoppel, fraud,
30 misrepresentation, duress, coercion, mistake, and bankruptcy, supplement this chapter except to the
31 extent that any statute is inconsistent with this chapter.
32 19-35-15. Uniformity of application and construction.
33 In applying and construing this chapter, a court shall consider the promotion of uniformity
34 of the law among jurisdictions that enact it.

1 19-35-16. Transitional provision.
2 This chapter applies to:
3 (1) A special deposit made under an account agreement executed on or after the effective
4 date of this chapter; and
5 (2) A deposit made under an agreement executed before the effective date of this chapter,
6 if:
7 (i) All parties entitled to amend the agreement agree to make the deposit a special deposit
8 governed by this chapter; and
9 (ii) The special deposit referenced in the amended agreement satisfies § 19-35-5.
10 19-35-17. Severability clause.
11 If a provision of this chapter or its application to a person or circumstance is held invalid,
12 the invalidity does not affect any other provision or application of this chapter that can be given
13 effect without the invalid provision.
14 SECTION 2. This act shall take effect upon passage.
