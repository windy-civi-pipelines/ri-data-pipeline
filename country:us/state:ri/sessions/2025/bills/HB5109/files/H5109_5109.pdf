2 305 and 6A-11-306 of the General Laws in Chapter 6A-11 entitled "Transitional Provisions for
3 Uniform Commercial Code Amendments (2022)" are hereby amended to read as follows:
4 6A-11-201. Saving clause.
5 Except as provided in Part 3 of this chapter, a transaction validly entered into before
6 January 1, 2024 June 10, 2024 and the rights, duties, and interests flowing from the transaction
7 remain valid thereafter and may be terminated, completed, consummated, or enforced as required
8 or permitted by law other than this title or, if applicable, this title, as though the amendatory act of
9 June 10, 2024 had not taken effect.
10 6A-11-301. Saving clause.
11 (a) Pre-effective-date transaction, lien, or interest. Except as provided in this part,
12 chapter 9 of this title as amended by the amendatory act of June 10, 2024 and chapter 12 of this
13 title apply to a transaction, lien, or other interest in property, even if the transaction, lien, or interest
14 was entered into, created, or acquired before January 1, 2024 June 10, 2024.
15 (b) Continuing validity. Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section and ยง 6A-11-
16 302 through ยง 6A-11-306:
17 (1) A transaction, lien, or interest in property that was validly entered into, created, or
18 transferred before January 1, 2024 June 10, 2024 and was not governed by this title, but would be

1 subject to chapter 9 of this title as amended by the amendatory act of June 10, 2024 or chapter 12
2 of this title if it had been entered into, created, or transferred on or after January 1, 2024 June 10,
3 2024, including the rights, duties, and interests flowing from the transaction, lien, or interest,
4 remains valid on and after January 1, 2024 June 10, 2024; and
5 (2) The transaction, lien, or interest may be terminated, completed, consummated, and
6 enforced as required or permitted by the amendatory act of June 10, 2024 or by the law that would
7 apply if the amendatory act of June 10, 2024 had not taken effect.
8 (c) Pre-effective-date proceeding. The amendatory act of June 10, 2024 does not affect
9 an action, case, or proceeding commenced before January 1, 2024 June 10, 2024.
10 6A-11-302. Security interest perfected before effective date.
11 (a) Continuing perfection: perfection requirements satisfied. A security interest that is
12 enforceable and perfected immediately before January 1, 2024 June 10, 2024, is a perfected security
13 interest under the amendatory act of June 10, 2024 if, on January 1, 2024 June 10, 2024, the
14 requirements for enforceability and perfection under the amendatory act of June 10, 2024 are
15 satisfied without further action.
16 (b) Continuing perfection: enforceability or perfection requirements not satisfied. If
17 a security interest is enforceable and perfected immediately before January 1, 2024 June 10, 2024,
18 but the requirements for enforceability or perfection under the amendatory act of June 10, 2024 are
19 not satisfied on January 1, 2024 June 10, 2024, the security interest:
20 (1) Is a perfected security interest until the earlier of the time perfection would have ceased
21 under the law in effect immediately before January 1, 2024 June 10, 2024 or the adjustment date;
22 (2) Remains enforceable thereafter only if the security interest satisfies the requirements
23 for enforceability under ยง 6A-9-203, as amended by the amendatory act of June 10, 2024, before
24 the adjustment date; and
25 (3) Remains perfected thereafter only if the requirements for perfection under the
26 amendatory act of June 10, 2024 are satisfied before the time specified in subsection (b)(1) of this
27 section.
28 6A-11-303. Security interest unperfected before effective date.
29 A security interest that is enforceable immediately before January 1, 2024 June 10, 2024,
30 but is unperfected at that time:
31 (1) Remains an enforceable security interest until the adjustment date;
32 (2) Remains enforceable thereafter if the security interest becomes enforceable under ยง 6A-
33 9-203, as amended by the amendatory act, on January 1, 2024 June 10, 2024, or before the
34 adjustment date; and
LC000514 - Page 2 of 5

1 (3) Becomes perfected:
2 (i) Without further action, on January 1, 2024 June 10, 2024, if the requirements for
3 perfection under the amendatory act of June 10, 2024 are satisfied before or at that time; or
4 (ii) When the requirements for perfection are satisfied if the requirements are satisfied after
5 that time.
6 6A-11-304. Effectiveness of actions taken before effective date.
7 (a) Pre-effective-date action; attachment and perfection before adjustment date. If
8 action, other than the filing of a financing statement, is taken before January 1, 2024 June 10, 2024,
9 and the action would have resulted in perfection of the security interest had the security interest
10 become enforceable before January 1, 2024 June 10, 2024, the action is effective to perfect a
11 security interest that attaches under the amendatory act of June 10, 2024 before the adjustment date.
12 An attached security interest becomes unperfected on the adjustment date unless the security
13 interest becomes a perfected security interest under the amendatory act of June 10, 2024 before the
14 adjustment date.
15 (b) Pre-effective-date filing. The filing of a financing statement before January 1, 2024
16 June 10, 2024, is effective to perfect a security interest on January 1, 2024 June 10, 2024, to the
17 extent the filing would satisfy the requirements for perfection under the amendatory act of June 10,
18 2024.
19 (c) Pre-effective-date enforceability action. The taking of an action before January 1,
20 2024 June 10, 2024, is sufficient for the enforceability of a security interest on January 1, 2024
21 June 10, 2024, if the action would satisfy the requirements for enforceability under the amendatory
22 act of June 10, 2024.
23 6A-11-305. Priority.
24 (a) Determination of priority. Subject to subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the
25 amendatory act of June 10, 2024 determines the priority of conflicting claims to collateral.
26 (b) Established priorities. Subject to subsection (c) of this section, if the priorities of
27 claims to collateral were established before January 1, 2024 June 10, 2024, chapter 9 of this title as
28 in effect before January 1, 2024 June 10, 2024, determines priority.
29 (c) Determination of certain priorities on adjustment date. On the adjustment date, to
30 the extent the priorities determined by chapter 9 of this title as amended by the amendatory act of
31 June 10, 2024 modify the priorities established before January 1, 2024 June 10, 2024, the priorities
32 of claims to chapter 12 of this title property and electronic money established before January 1,
33 2024 June 10, 2024, cease to apply.
34 6A-11-306. Priority of claims when priority rules of chapter 9 do not apply.
LC000514 - Page 3 of 5

1 (a) Determination of priority. Subject to subsections (b) and (c) of this section, chapter
2 12 of this title determines the priority of conflicting claims to chapter 12 of this title property when
3 the priority rules of chapter 9 of this title as amended by the amendatory act of June 10, 2024 do
4 not apply.
5 (b) Established priorities. Subject to subsection (c) of this section, when the priority rules
6 of chapter 9 of this title as amended by the amendatory act of June 10, 2024 do not apply and the
7 priorities of claims to chapter 12 of this title property were established before January 1, 2024 June
8 10, 2024, law other than chapter 12 of this title determines priority.
9 (c) Determination of certain priorities on adjustment date. When the priority rules of
10 chapter 9 of this title as amended by the amendatory act of June 10, 2024 do not apply, to the extent
11 the priorities determined by the amendatory act of June 10, 2024 modify the priorities established
12 before January 1, 2024 June 10, 2024, the priorities of claims to chapter 12 of this title property
13 established before January 1, 2024 June 10, 2024, cease to apply on the adjustment date.
