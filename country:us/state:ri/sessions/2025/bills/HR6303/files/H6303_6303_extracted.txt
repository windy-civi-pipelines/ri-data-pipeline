WEEK” IN THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND
Introduced By: Representatives Azzinaro, Shekarchi, Blazejewski, Kennedy,
Chippendale, Costantino, Lima, Corvese, Finkelman, and Bennett
Date Introduced: May 06, 2025
Referred To: House read and passed
1 WHEREAS, The American Lung Association’s LUNG FORCE initiative has been
2 working to ensure that fewer people are diagnosed with lung cancer and those living with the
3 disease live longer since 2014; and
4 WHEREAS, Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death among individuals
5 in the United States, accounting for more deaths than colon cancer, breast cancer, and prostate
6 cancer combined; and
7 WHEREAS, Lung cancer screening saves lives, and advocacy and increased awareness
8 will result in more high-risk individuals getting screened; and
9 WHEREAS, One in 16 men and one in 17 women in the United States will develop lung
10 cancer during their lifetimes, and approximately 70 percent of adults are not familiar with lung
11 cancer screening and the low-dose computed tomography scan; and
12 WHEREAS, The rate of lung cancer death in women in the United States has increased
13 by 92 percent over the 50-year span from 1971 to 2021, and each year, more women die from
14 lung cancer than from breast cancer and ovarian cancer combined; and
15 WHEREAS, Eighteen percent of lung cancers are unrelated to smoking, and the
16 proportion of lung cancers diagnosed in individuals who have never smoked is increasing in the
17 United States. The 5-year survival rate for localized lung cancer is 63 percent, yet a majority of
18 lung cancers are diagnosed at a distant stage, for which the 5-year survival rate is 8 percent, and
19 WHEREAS, Screening with low-dose computed tomography can detect lung cancer in its
1 earliest stages and ultimately save lives, yet only 3 to 7 percent of individuals in the United States
2 at high risk for lung cancer undergo lung cancer screening; and
3 WHEREAS, Veterans are 25 percent more likely to develop lung cancer compared to the
4 general public, and, although approximately 1,000,000 to 2,000,000 veterans have an elevated
5 risk of lung cancer and are eligible for screening, less than 3 percent of veterans get screened; and
6 WHEREAS, Black men have the highest incidence of lung cancer and the highest
7 mortality rate from lung cancer in the United States, and non-White individuals are 14 to 17
8 percent less likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer early; and
9 WHEREAS, Lung cancer research is leading to breakthroughs in biomarker identification
10 and the development of immunotherapies and targeted therapies that are highly effective for some
11 cancer subtypes, yet accessing cutting-edge testing as part of the lung cancer diagnostic process
12 can be difficult. Public support for research funding will result in new treatments and better
13 methods of early detection; and
14 WHEREAS, LUNG FORCE is a national initiative led by the American Lung
15 Association, to defeat lung cancer; and
16 WHEREAS, Educational efforts can increase awareness of lung cancer and lung cancer
17 screening among the general public, patients and their families, and health care workers, thereby
18 increasing the early detection of lung cancer; now, therefore be it
19 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
20 designates the second week in May as Lung Cancer Action Week throughout Rhode Island in
21 order to promote efforts to increase awareness of lung cancer education, and research on
22 mitigation of risk factors, lung cancer screening, treatment of lung cancer, and lung cancer issues
23 affecting minorities and individuals who have never smoked. This House also encourages the
24 people of Rhode Island to observe Lung Cancer Action Week with appreciation and awareness of
25 educational activities to learn more about lung cancer, its risk factors, and early detection and the
26 best ways to take preemptive action; and be it further
27 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
28 transmit a duly certified copy of this resolution to the American Lung Association.
