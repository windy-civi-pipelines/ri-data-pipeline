14 When a limited liability company has converted to another entity or business form pursuant to this
15 section, for all purposes of the laws of the state of Rhode Island, the other entity or business form
16 shall be deemed to be the same entity as the converting limited liability company and conversion

18 other entity or business form.
19 (d) In connection with a conversion of a domestic limited liability company to another
20 entity or business form pursuant to this section, rights or securities of or interests in the domestic
21 limited liability company that is to be converted may be exchanged for or converted into cash,
22 property, rights, or securities of or interests in the entity or business form into which the domestic

3 (4) The future effective date or time (which shall be a date or time certain) of the conversion
4 if it is not to be effective upon the filing of the certificate of conversion to non-Rhode Island entity;
5 (5) That the conversion has been approved in accordance with this section;

7 the state of Rhode Island in any action, suit, or proceeding for enforcement of any obligation of the
8 limited liability company arising while it was a limited liability company of the state of Rhode
9 Island, and that it irrevocably appoints the secretary of state as its agent to accept service of process
10 in any such action, suit, or proceeding.
11 (f) Upon the filing in the office of the secretary of state of the certificate of conversion to
12 non-Rhode Island entity or upon the future effective date or time of the certificate of conversion to
13 non-Rhode Island entity and upon payment of all fees due by the limited liability company, the
14 secretary of state shall certify that the limited liability company has filed all documents and paid
15 all fees required by this chapter, and thereupon the limited liability company shall cease to exist as

22 of an assignee to receive distributions as to the withdrawn member's interest during any

2 (1) The limited liability company would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in
3 the usual course of business; or
4 (2) The limited liability company's total assets would be less than the sum of its total
5 liabilities plus, unless the operating agreement provides otherwise, the amount that would be
6 needed, if the limited liability company were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy
7 the preferential rights of other members upon dissolution that are superior to the rights of the
8 member receiving the distribution.
9 (b) The limited liability company may base a determination that a distribution is not
10 prohibited under subsection (a) on:
11 (1) Financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles that
12 are reasonable under the circumstances; or
13 (2) A fair valuation or other method that is reasonable under the circumstances.

25 is entitled to contribution:
26 (1) From each other member or manager who could be held liable under subsection (a) for

6 (a) Unless otherwise provided in the articles of organization or a written operating
7 agreement:
8 (1) A membership interest is assignable in whole or in part;
9 (2) An assignment of a membership interest does not of itself dissolve a limited liability
10 company or entitle the assignee to participate in the management and affairs of the limited liability
11 company or to become a member or to exercise any rights or powers of a member;
12 (3) An assignment entitles the assignee to receive, to the extent assigned, only the
13 distributions to which the assignor would be entitled; and
14 (4) A member ceases to be a member and to have the power to exercise any rights or powers
15 of a member on assignment of all of the member's membership interest.
16 (b) Unless otherwise provided in the articles of organization or an operating agreement, the

18 membership interest of a member is not deemed an assignment of a membership interest.
19 (c) Unless otherwise provided in the articles of organization or an operating agreement and
20 except to the extent provided in a written agreement signed by an assignee, until an assignee of a
21 membership interest becomes a member, the assignee has no liability as a member solely as a result
22 of the assignment.
23 7-16-36. Right of assignee to become a member.
24 (a) Except as otherwise provided in a written operating agreement, an assignee of an
25 interest in a limited liability company may become a member only if the other members
26 unanimously consent. The consent of a member may be evidenced in any manner specified in an
27 operating agreement, but in the absence of specification, consent is evidenced by a written
28 instrument, dated and signed by the member, or evidenced by a vote taken at a meeting of the
29 members called in accordance with the operating agreement and maintained with the records of the
30 limited liability company.
31 (b) An assignee who becomes a member has, to the extent assigned, the rights and powers,
32 and is subject to the restrictions and liabilities, of a member under the articles of organization, any
33 operating agreement and this chapter.

6 On application to a court of competent jurisdiction by any judgment creditor of a member,
7 the court may charge the membership interest of the member with payment of the unsatisfied
8 amount of judgment with interest. To the extent charged, the judgment creditor has only the rights
9 of an assignee of the membership interest. This chapter does not deprive any member of the benefit
10 of any exemption laws applicable to that member's membership interest.
11 7-16-38. Powers of estate of a member.
12 (a) If a member who is an individual dies or a court of competent jurisdiction adjudges the
13 member to be incompetent to manage the member's person or property, the member's executor,
14 administrator, guardian, conservator or other legal representative may exercise all of the member's
15 rights for the purpose of settling the estate or administering property, including any power under
16 the articles of organization or a written operating agreement permitting an assignee to become a
17 member.
18 (b) If a member is a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, domestic or foreign
19 limited liability company, trust, estate, association or other entity and is dissolved or terminated,
20 the powers of that member may be exercised by its legal representative or successor.

34 agreement, on the death, withdrawal, expulsion, bankruptcy or dissolution of the last remaining
LC002870 - Page 27 of 137

1 member or any other event that terminates the continued membership of the last remaining member,
2 unless within ninety (90) days the successor(s) in interest of the last remaining member and any
3 assignees of the member's interest and of any other member's interest agree in writing to admit at

6 7-16.1-106. Operating agreement -- Effect on limited liability company and person

27 company or its members to the person in the person's capacity as a transferee or person dissociated
28 as a member; and

30 liability on the transferee or person dissociated as a member.
31 (c) If a record delivered by a limited liability company to the secretary of state for filing
32 becomes effective and contains a provision that would be ineffective under §§ 7-16.1-105(c) or
33 (d)(3) if contained in the operating agreement, the provision is ineffective in the record.
34 (d) Subject to subsection (c) of this section, if a record delivered by a limited liability
LC002870 - Page 54 of 137

1 company to the secretary of state for filing becomes effective and conflicts with a provision of the
2 operating agreement:
3 (1) The agreement prevails as to members, persons dissociated as members, transferees,
4 and managers; and
5 (2) The record prevails as to other persons to the extent they reasonably rely on the record.
6 7-16.1-108. Nature, purpose, and duration of limited liability company.

17 law or rules or regulations regarding the rendering of professional services through a professional
18 corporation.

20 (a) The liability of an individual authorized to practice a profession for the person's own
21 negligence, wrongful acts or misconduct, or that of any person under the person's direct supervision

24 liability company.
25 (b) An individual authorized to practice a profession and who is a member of a domestic
26 or foreign limited liability company rendering professional services in this state is not liable solely
27 by reason of being a member for any negligence, wrongful acts or misconduct of another member
28 or agent of the limited liability company. A domestic or foreign limited liability company rendering
29 professional services in the state is liable for the negligence, wrongful acts or misconduct of its
30 members and agents providing professional services through the limited liability company within
31 the scope of their authority or apparent authority to act for the limited liability company.
32 (c) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, the personal liability of a member
33 in a limited liability company engaged in the rendering of professional services shall not be less
34 than or greater than the personal liability of a shareholder of a professional corporation organized

5 kinds of negligence, wrongful acts or misconduct for which liability is limited by § 7-16.1-108.2.
6 The insurance shall be in the aggregate amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) multiplied by
7 the number of professional employees of the limited liability company as of the policy anniversary
8 date; provided, however, that in no case shall the coverage be less than one hundred thousand
9 dollars ($100,000) but in no event shall the necessary coverage exceed a maximum of five hundred
10 thousand dollars ($500,000); provided further, however, that any policy for insurance coverage
11 may include a deductible provision in any amount not to exceed twenty-five thousand dollars
12 ($25,000) for each claim multiplied by the number of professional employees of the limited liability
13 company as of the date of the issuance of the policy. The policy or policies of insurance may be
14 subject to any terms, conditions, exclusions and endorsements that are typically contained in
15 policies of this type.
16 (b) If, in any proceeding, compliance by a limited liability company with the requirements
17 of subsection (a) of this section is disputed:
18 (1) That issue shall be determined by the court; and
19 (2) The burden of proof of compliance shall be on the person who claims the limitation of
20 liability in § 7-16.1-108.2.
21 (c) If a limited liability company is in compliance with the requirements of subsection (a)
22 of this section, the requirements of this section shall not be admissible or in any way be made
23 known to a jury in determining an issue of liability for or extent of the debt or obligation or damages
24 in question.
25 (d) Insurance is reasonably available for the purpose of subsection (a) of this section if, at
26 the time that the coverage would apply to the negligence, wrongful acts or misconduct in question,
27 it was reasonably available to similar types of limited liability companies through the admitted or
28 eligible surplus lines market.
29 (e) A limited liability company is considered to be in compliance with subsection (a) of
30 this section if the limited liability company provides five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) of
31 funds specifically designated and segregated for the satisfaction of judgments against the limited
32 liability company based on the forms of negligence, wrongful acts and misconduct for which
33 liability is limited by § 7-16.1-108.2 by:
34 (1) Deposit in trust or in bank escrow of cash, bank certificate of deposit or United States
LC002870 - Page 56 of 137

1 Treasury obligations; or
2 (2) A bank letter of credit or insurance company bonds.
3 (f) To the extent that a limited liability company maintains liability insurance or segregated
4 funds pursuant to the laws or regulations of another jurisdiction, the liability insurance or
5 segregated funds shall be deemed to satisfy this section if the amount of them is equal to or greater
6 than the amount specified in subsections (a) or (e) of this section.
7 7-16.1-108.4. Low-profit limited liability company.
8 (a) A domestic limited liability company may be formed as a low-profit limited liability
9 company. A low-profit limited liability company shall at all times significantly further the
10 accomplishment of one or more charitable or educational purposes within the meaning of §
11 170(c)(2)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 26 U.S.C. § 170(c)(2)(B), or its successor, and
12 would not have been formed but for the entity's relationship to the accomplishment of charitable or
13 educational purposes.
14 (b) A limited liability company that intends to qualify as a low-profit limited liability
15 company pursuant to the provisions of this section shall so indicate in its articles of organization,
16 shall organize under the provisions of § 7-16.1-201, and shall further state that:
17 (1) No significant purpose of the entity is the production of income or the appreciation of
18 property; provided, however, that the fact that an entity produces significant income or capital
19 appreciation shall not, in the absence of other factors, be conclusive evidence of a significant
20 purpose involving the production of income or the appreciation of property.
21 (2) No purpose of the entity is to accomplish one or more political or legislative purposes
22 within the meaning of § 170(c)(2)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 26 U.S.C. §
23 170(c)(2)(D), or its successor.
24 (c) If an entity that met the requirements of this section at its formation at any time ceases
25 to satisfy any one of the requirements, it shall immediately cease to be a low-profit limited liability
26 company, but by continuing to meet all the other requirements of this chapter, will continue to exist
27 as a limited liability company. The name of the entity shall be changed to be in conformance with
28 § 7-16.1-112.
29 (d) Nothing in this section shall prevent a limited liability company that is not organized
30 under it from electing a charitable or educational purpose in whole or in part for doing business

22 shall begin revocation proceedings in accordance with the provisions of § 7-16.1-708.

33 7-16.1-215. Revocation of articles or authority to transact business for nonpayment
34 of fee.
LC002870 - Page 73 of 137

1 (a) The tax administrator may, after July 15 of each year, compile a list of all limited
2 liability companies that have failed to pay any state fees and/or taxes for one year after the fees

17 RELATIONS OF MEMBERS AND MANAGERS TO PERSONS DEALING WITH LIMITED
18 LIABILITY COMPANY
19 7-16.1-301. No agency power of member as member.
20 (a) A member is not an agent of a limited liability company solely by reason of being a
21 member.
22 (b) A person's status as a member does not prevent or restrict law other than this chapter
23 from imposing liability on a limited liability company because of the person's conduct.
24 7-16.1-302. Statement of limited liability company authority.
25 (a) A limited liability company may deliver to the secretary of state for filing a statement
26 of authority. The statement:

1 (i) Sign an instrument transferring real property held in the name of the company; or
2 (ii) Enter into other transactions on behalf of, or otherwise act for or bind, the company.
3 (b) To amend or cancel a statement of authority filed by the secretary of state, a limited
4 liability company shall deliver to the secretary of state for filing an amendment or cancellation
5 stating:
6 (1) The name of the company;
7 (2) The name and street address of the company's registered agent;
8 (3) The date the statement being affected became effective; and
9 (4) The contents of the amendment or a declaration that the statement is canceled.
10 (c) A statement of authority affects only the power of a person to bind a limited liability
11 company to persons that are not members.
12 (d) Subject to subsection (c) of this section and § 7-16.1-103(d), and except as otherwise
13 provided in subsections (f), (g), and (h) of this section, a limitation on the authority of a person or
14 a position contained in an effective statement of authority is not by itself evidence of any person's
15 knowledge or notice of the limitation.
16 (e) Subject to subsection (c) of this section, a grant of authority not pertaining to transfers
17 of real property and contained in an effective statement of authority is conclusive in favor of a
18 person that gives value in reliance on the grant, except to the extent that when the person gives
19 value:
20 (1) The person has knowledge to the contrary;
21 (2) The statement has been canceled or restrictively amended under subsection (b) of this
22 section; or
23 (3) A limitation on the grant is contained in another statement of authority that became
24 effective after the statement containing the grant became effective.
25 (f) Subject to subsection (c) of this section, an effective statement of authority that grants
26 authority to transfer real property held in the name of the limited liability company, a certified copy
27 of which statement is recorded in the office for recording transfers of the real property, is conclusive
28 in favor of a person that gives value in reliance on the grant without knowledge to the contrary,
29 except to the extent that when the person gives value:
30 (1) The statement has been canceled or restrictively amended under subsection (b) of this
31 section, and a certified copy of the cancellation or restrictive amendment has been recorded in the
32 office for recording transfers of the real property; or
33 (2) A limitation on the grant is contained in another statement of authority that became
34 effective after the statement containing the grant became effective, and a certified copy of the later-
LC002870 - Page 75 of 137

1 effective statement is recorded in the office for recording transfers of the real property.
2 (g) Subject to subsection (c) of this section, if a certified copy of an effective statement
3 containing a limitation on the authority to transfer real property held in the name of a limited
4 liability company is recorded in the office for recording transfers of that real property, all persons
5 are deemed to know of the limitation.
6 (h) Subject to subsection (i) of this section, an effective statement of dissolution or
7 termination is a cancellation of any filed statement of authority for the purposes of subsection (f)
8 of this section and is a limitation on authority for the purposes of subsection (g) of this section.
9 (i) After a statement of dissolution becomes effective, a limited liability company shall
10 deliver to the secretary of state for filing and, if appropriate, shall record a statement of authority
11 that is designated as a post-dissolution statement of authority. The statement operates as provided
12 in subsections (f) and (g) of this section.
13 (j) Unless earlier canceled, an effective statement of authority is canceled by operation of
14 law five (5) years after the date on which the statement, or its most recent amendment, becomes
15 effective. This cancellation operates without need for any recording under subsection (f) or (g) of
16 this section.
17 (k) An effective statement of denial operates as a restrictive amendment under this section
18 and shall be recorded by certified copy for purposes of subsection (f)(1) of this section.

22 (1) Provides the name of the limited liability company and the caption of the statement of
23 authority to which the statement of denial pertains; and
24 (2) Denies the grant of authority.
25 7-16.1-304. Liability of members and managers.
26 (a) A debt, obligation, or other liability of a limited liability company is solely the debt,
27 obligation, or other liability of the company. A member or manager is not personally liable, directly
28 or indirectly, by way of contribution or otherwise, for a debt, obligation, or other liability of the
29 company solely by reason of being or acting as a member or manager. This subsection applies
30 regardless of the dissolution of the company.
31 (b) The failure of a limited liability company to observe formalities relating to the exercise
32 of its powers or management of its activities and affairs is not a ground for imposing liability on a
33 member or manager for a debt, obligation, or other liability of the company.
34 ARTICLE 4
LC002870 - Page 76 of 137

1 RELATIONS OF MEMBERS TO EACH OTHER AND TO LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY
2 7-16.1-401. Becoming a member.
3 (a) If a limited liability company is to have only one member upon formation, the person
4 becomes a member as agreed by that person and the organizer of the company. That person and the
5 organizer may be, but need not be, different persons. If different, the organizer acts on behalf of
6 the initial member.
7 (b) If a limited liability company is to have more than one member upon formation, those
8 persons become members as agreed by the persons before the formation of the company. The
9 organizer acts on behalf of the persons in forming the company and may be, but need not be, one
10 of the persons.
11 (c) After formation of a limited liability company, a person becomes a member:
12 (1) As provided in the operating agreement;
13 (2) As the result of a transaction effective under Article 10;
14 (3) With the affirmative vote or consent of all the members; or
15 (4) As provided in § 7-16.1-701(a)(3).
16 (d) A person may become a member without:
17 (1) Acquiring a transferable interest; or
18 (2) Making or being obligated to make a contribution to the limited liability company.
19 7-16.1-402. Form of contribution.
20 A contribution may consist of property transferred to, services performed for, or another
21 benefit provided to the limited liability company or an agreement to transfer property to, perform
22 services for, or provide another benefit to the company.
23 7-16.1-403. Liability for contributions.
24 (a) A person's obligation to make a contribution to a limited liability company is not
25 excused by the person's death, disability, termination, or other inability to perform personally.
26 (b) If a person does not fulfill an obligation to make a contribution other than money, the
27 person is obligated at the option of the limited liability company to contribute money equal to the
28 value of the part of the contribution which has not been made.
29 (c) The obligation of a person to make a contribution may be compromised only by the
30 affirmative vote or consent of all the members. If a creditor of a limited liability company extends
31 credit or otherwise acts in reliance on an obligation described in subsection (a) of this section
32 without knowledge or notice of a compromise under this subsection, the creditor may enforce the
33 obligation.
34 7-16.1-404. Sharing of and right to distributions before dissolution.
LC002870 - Page 77 of 137

1 (a) Any distribution made by a limited liability company before its dissolution and winding
2 up shall be in equal shares among members and persons dissociated as members, except to the
3 extent necessary to comply with a transfer effective under § 7-16.1-502 or charging order in effect
4 under § 7-16.1-503.
5 (b) A person has a right to a distribution before the dissolution and winding up of a limited
6 liability company only if the company decides to make an interim distribution. A person's
7 dissociation does not entitle the person to a distribution.
8 (c) A person does not have a right to demand or receive a distribution from a limited
9 liability company in any form other than money. Except as otherwise provided in § 7-16.1-707(d),
10 a company may distribute an asset in kind only if each part of the asset is fungible with each other
11 part and each person receives a percentage of the asset equal in value to the person's share of
12 distributions.
13 (d) If a member or transferee becomes entitled to receive a distribution, the member or
14 transferee has the status of, and is entitled to all remedies available to, a creditor of the limited
15 liability company with respect to the distribution; provided, however, the company's obligation to
16 make a distribution is subject to offset for any amount owed to the company by the member or a
17 person dissociated as a member on whose account the distribution is made.
18 7-16.1-405. Limitations on distributions.
19 (a) A limited liability company shall not make a distribution, including a distribution under
20 § 7-16.1-707, if after the distribution:
21 (1) The company would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the ordinary
22 course of the company's activities and affairs; or
23 (2) The company's total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the
24 amount that would be needed, if the company were to be dissolved and wound up at the time of the
25 distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution and winding up of members and
26 transferees whose preferential rights are superior to the rights of persons receiving the distribution.
27 (b) A limited liability company may base a determination that a distribution is not
28 prohibited under subsection (a) of this section on:
29 (1) Financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles that
30 are reasonable in the circumstances; or
31 (2) A fair valuation or other method that is reasonable under the circumstances.
32 (c) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e) of this section, the effect of a distribution
33 under subsection (a) of this section is measured:
34 (1) In the case of a distribution as defined in § 7-16.1-102(4)(A), as of the earlier of:
LC002870 - Page 78 of 137

1 (i) The date money or other property is transferred or debt is incurred by the limited liability
2 company; or
3 (ii) The date the person entitled to the distribution ceases to own the interest or right being
4 acquired by the company in return for the distribution;
5 (2) In the case of any other distribution of indebtedness, as of the date the indebtedness is
6 distributed; and
7 (3) In all other cases, as of the date:
8 (i) The distribution is authorized, if the payment occurs not later than one hundred twenty
9 (120) days after that date; or
10 (ii) The payment is made, if the payment occurs more than one hundred twenty (120) days
11 after the distribution is authorized.
12 (d) A limited liability company's indebtedness to a member or transferee incurred by reason
13 of a distribution made in accordance with this section is at parity with the company's indebtedness
14 to its general, unsecured creditors, except to the extent subordinated by agreement.
15 (e) A limited liability company's indebtedness, including indebtedness issued as a
16 distribution, is not a liability for purposes of subsection (a) of this section if the terms of the
17 indebtedness provide that payment of principal and interest is made only if and to the extent that
18 payment of a distribution could then be made under this section. If the indebtedness is issued as a
19 distribution, each payment of principal or interest is treated as a distribution, the effect of which is
20 measured on the date the payment is made.
21 (f) In measuring the effect of a distribution under § 7-16.1-707, the liabilities of a dissolved
22 limited liability company do not include any claim that has been disposed of under §§ 7-16.1-704,
23 7-16.1-705, or 7-16.1-706.
24 7-16.1-406. Liability for improper distributions.
25 (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) of this section, if a member of a member-
26 managed limited liability company or manager of a manager-managed limited liability company
27 consents to a distribution made in violation of § 7-16.1-405 and in consenting to the distribution
28 fails to comply with § 7-16.1-409, the member or manager is personally liable to the company for
29 the amount of the distribution which exceeds the amount that could have been distributed without
30 the violation of § 7-16.1-405.
31 (b) To the extent the operating agreement of a member-managed limited liability company
32 expressly relieves a member of the authority and responsibility to consent to distributions and
33 imposes that authority and responsibility on one or more other members, the liability stated in
34 subsection (a) of this section applies to the other members and not the member that the operating
LC002870 - Page 79 of 137

1 agreement relieves of the authority and responsibility.
2 (c) A person that receives a distribution knowing that the distribution violated § 7-16.1-
3 405 is personally liable to the limited liability company but only to the extent that the distribution
4 received by the person exceeded the amount that could have been properly paid under § 7-16.1-
5 405.
6 (d) A person against which an action is commenced because the person is liable under
7 subsection (a) of this section may:
8 (1) Implead any other person that is liable under subsection (a) of this section and seek to
9 enforce a right of contribution from the person; and
10 (2) Implead any person that received a distribution in violation of subsection (c) of this
11 section and seek to enforce a right of contribution from the person in the amount the person received
12 in violation of subsection (c) of this section.
13 (e) An action under this section is barred unless commenced not later than two (2) years
14 after the distribution.
15 7-16.1-407. Management of limited liability company.
16 (a) A limited liability company is a member-managed limited liability company unless the
17 certificate of formation:
18 (1) Expressly provides that:
19 (i) The company is or will be "manager-managed";
20 (ii) The company is or will be "managed by managers"; or
21 (iii) Management of the company is or will be "vested in managers"; or
22 (2) Includes words of similar import.
23 (b) In a member-managed limited liability company, the following rules apply:
24 (1) Except as expressly provided in this chapter, the management and conduct of the
25 company are vested in the members.
26 (2) Each member has equal rights in the management and conduct of the company's
27 activities and affairs.
28 (3) A difference arising among members as to a matter in the ordinary course of the
29 activities and affairs of the company may be decided by a majority of the members.
30 (4) The affirmative vote or consent of all the members is required to:
31 (i) Undertake an act outside the ordinary course of the activities and affairs of the company;
32 or
33 (ii) Amend the operating agreement.
34 (c) In a manager-managed limited liability company, the following rules apply:
LC002870 - Page 80 of 137

1 (1) Except as expressly provided in this chapter, any matter relating to the activities and
2 affairs of the company is decided exclusively by the manager, or, if there is more than one manager,
3 by a majority of the managers.
4 (2) Each manager has equal rights in the management and conduct of the company's
5 activities and affairs.
6 (3) The affirmative vote or consent of all members is required to:
7 (i) Undertake an act outside the ordinary course of the company's activities and affairs; or
8 (ii) Amend the operating agreement.
9 (4) A manager may be chosen at any time by the affirmative vote or consent of a majority
10 of the members and remains a manager until a successor has been chosen, unless the manager at an
11 earlier time resigns, is removed, or dies, or, in the case of a manager that is not an individual,
12 terminates. A manager may be removed at any time by the affirmative vote or consent of a majority
13 of the members without notice or cause.
14 (5) A person need not be a member to be a manager, but the dissociation of a member that
15 is also a manager removes the person as a manager. If a person that is both a manager and a member
16 ceases to be a manager, that cessation does not by itself dissociate the person as a member.
17 (6) A person's ceasing to be a manager does not discharge any debt, obligation, or other
18 liability to the limited liability company or members which the person incurred while a manager.
19 (d) An action requiring the vote or consent of members under this chapter may be taken
20 without a meeting, and a member may appoint a proxy or other agent to vote, consent, or otherwise
21 act for the member by signing an appointing record, personally or by the member's agent.
22 (e) The dissolution of a limited liability company does not affect the applicability of this
23 section; provided, however, a person that wrongfully causes dissolution of the company loses the
24 right to participate in management as a member and a manager.
25 (f) A limited liability company shall reimburse a member for an advance to the company
26 beyond the amount of capital the member agreed to contribute.
27 (g) A payment or advance made by a member which gives rise to a limited liability
28 company obligation under subsection (f) of this section or § 7-16.1-408(a) constitutes a loan to the
29 company which accrues interest from the date of the payment or advance.
30 (h) A member is not entitled to remuneration for services performed for a member-
31 managed limited liability company, except for reasonable compensation for services rendered in
32 winding up the activities of the company.
33 7-16.1-408. Reimbursement -- Indemnification -- Advancement -- Insurance.
34 (a) A limited liability company shall reimburse a member of a member-managed company
LC002870 - Page 81 of 137

1 or the manager of a manager-managed company for any payment made by the member or manager
2 in the course of the member's or manager's activities on behalf of the company, if the member or
3 manager complied with §§ 7-16.1-405, 7-16.1-407, and 7-16.1-409 in making the payment.
4 (b) A limited liability company shall indemnify and hold harmless a person with respect to
5 any claim or demand against the person and any debt, obligation, or other liability incurred by the
6 person by reason of the person's former or present capacity as a member or manager, if the claim,
7 demand, debt, obligation, or other liability does not arise from the person's breach of §§ 7-16.1-
8 405, 7-16.1-407, or 7-16.1-409.
9 (c) In the ordinary course of its activities and affairs, a limited liability company may
10 advance reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees and costs, incurred by a person in
11 connection with a claim or demand against the person by reason of the person's former or present
12 capacity as a member or manager, if the person promises to repay the company if the person
13 ultimately is determined not to be entitled to be indemnified under subsection (b) of this section.
14 (d) A limited liability company may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of a
15 member or manager against liability asserted against or incurred by the member or manager in that
16 capacity or arising from that status even if, under § 7-16.1-105(c)(7), the operating agreement could
17 not eliminate or limit the person's liability to the company for the conduct giving rise to the liability.
18 7-16.1-409. Standards of conduct for members and managers.
19 (a) A member of a member-managed limited liability company owes to the company and,
20 subject to § 7-16.1-801, the other members the duties of loyalty and care stated in subsections (b)
21 and (c) of this section.

2 negligent or reckless conduct, willful or intentional misconduct, or knowing violation of law.

4 operating agreement and exercise any rights consistently with the contractual obligation of good
5 faith and fair dealing.
6 (e) A member does not violate a duty or obligation under this chapter or under the operating
7 agreement solely because the member's conduct furthers the member's own interest.

9 managed limited liability company may authorize or ratify, after full disclosure of all material facts,
10 a specific act or transaction that otherwise would violate the duty of loyalty.

33 information is material to the member's rights and duties under the operating agreement or this
34 chapter.
LC002870 - Page 83 of 137

1 (2) The company shall furnish to each member:
2 (i) Without demand, any information concerning the company's activities, affairs, financial

6 and
7 (ii) On demand, any other information concerning the company's activities, affairs,
8 financial condition, and other circumstances, except to the extent the demand for the information
9 demanded is unreasonable or otherwise improper under the circumstances.

25 of this section, the company shall inform in a record the member that made the demand of:
26 (i) What information the company will provide in response to the demand and when and
27 where the company will provide the information; and

24 ARTICLE 5
25 TRANSFERABLE INTERESTS AND RIGHTS OF TRANSFEREES AND CREDITORS
26 7-16.1-501. Nature of transferable interest.
27 A transferable interest is personal property.
28 7-16.1-502. Transfer of transferable interest.
29 (a) Subject to § 7-16.1-503(f), a transfer, in whole or in part, of a transferable interest:
30 (1) Is permissible;
31 (2) Does not by itself cause a person's dissociation as a member or a dissolution and
32 winding up of the limited liability company's activities and affairs; and
33 (3) Subject to § 7-16.1-504, does not entitle the transferee to:
34 (i) Participate in the management or conduct of the company's activities and affairs; or
LC002870 - Page 85 of 137

1 (ii) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) of this section, have access to records
2 or other information concerning the company's activities and affairs.
3 (b) A transferee has the right to receive, in accordance with the transfer, distributions to
4 which the transferor would otherwise be entitled.
5 (c) In a dissolution and winding up of a limited liability company, a transferee is entitled
6 to an account of the company's transactions only from the date of dissolution.
7 (d) A transferable interest may be evidenced by a certificate of the interest issued by a
8 limited liability company in a record, and, subject to this section, the interest represented by the
9 certificate may be transferred by a transfer of the certificate.
10 (e) A limited liability company need not give effect to a transferee's rights under this section
11 until the company knows or has notice of the transfer.
12 (f) A transfer of a transferable interest in violation of a restriction on transfer contained in
13 the operating agreement is ineffective if the intended transferee has knowledge or notice of the
14 restriction at the time of transfer.
15 (g) Except as otherwise provided in § 7-16.1-602(5)(ii), if a member transfers a transferable
16 interest, the transferor retains the rights of a member other than the transferable interest transferred
17 and retains all the duties and obligations of a member.
18 (h) If a member transfers a transferable interest to a person that becomes a member with
19 respect to the transferred interest, the transferee is liable for the member's obligations under §§ 7-
20 16.1-403 and 17-16.1-406 known to the transferee when the transferee becomes a member.
21 7-16.1-503. Charging order.
22 (a) On application by a judgment creditor of a member or transferee, a court may enter a
23 charging order against the transferable interest of the judgment debtor for the unsatisfied amount
24 of the judgment. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f) of this section, a charging order
25 constitutes a lien on a judgment debtor's transferable interest and requires the limited liability
26 company to pay over to the person to which the charging order was issued any distribution that
27 otherwise would be paid to the judgment debtor.
28 (b) To the extent necessary to effectuate the collection of distributions pursuant to a
29 charging order in effect under subsection (a) of this section, the court may:
30 (1) Appoint a receiver of the distributions subject to the charging order, with the power to
31 make all inquiries the judgment debtor might have made; and
32 (2) Make all other orders necessary to give effect to the charging order.
33 (c) Upon a showing that distributions under a charging order will not pay the judgment
34 debt within a reasonable time, the court may foreclose the lien and order the sale of the transferable
LC002870 - Page 86 of 137

1 interest. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f) of this section, the purchaser at the
2 foreclosure sale obtains only the transferable interest, does not thereby become a member, and is
3 subject to § 7-16.1-502.
4 (d) At any time before foreclosure under subsection (c) of this section, the member or
5 transferee whose transferable interest is subject to a charging order under subsection (a) of this
6 section may extinguish the charging order by satisfying the judgment and filing a certified copy of
7 the satisfaction with the court that issued the charging order.
8 (e) At any time before foreclosure under subsection (c) of this section, a limited liability
9 company or one or more members whose transferable interests are not subject to the charging order
10 may pay to the judgment creditor the full amount due under the judgment and thereby succeed to
11 the rights of the judgment creditor, including the charging order.
12 (f) If a court orders foreclosure of a charging order lien against the sole member of a limited
13 liability company:
14 (1) The court shall confirm the sale;
15 (2) The purchaser at the sale obtains the member's entire interest, not only the member's
16 transferable interest;
17 (3) The purchaser thereby becomes a member; and
18 (4) The person whose interest was subject to the foreclosed charging order is dissociated
19 as a member.
20 (g) This chapter does not deprive any member or transferee of the benefit of any exemption
21 law applicable to the transferable interest of the member or transferee.
22 (h) This section provides the exclusive remedy by which a person, seeking in the capacity
23 of judgment creditor to enforce a judgment against a member or transferee, may satisfy the
24 judgment from the judgment debtor's transferable interest.
25 7-16.1-504. Power of legal representative of deceased member.
26 If a member dies, the deceased member's legal representative may exercise:
27 (1) The rights of a transferee provided in § 7-16.1-502(c); and
28 (2) For the purposes of settling the estate, the rights the deceased member had under § 7-
29 16.1-410.
30 ARTICLE 6

34 by withdrawing as a member by express will under § 7-16.1-602(1).

9 dissolved or terminated.
10 (c) A person that wrongfully dissociates as a member is liable to the limited liability
11 company and, subject to § 7-16.1-801, to the other members for damages caused by the
12 dissociation. The liability is in addition to any debt, obligation, or other liability of the member to

15 A person is dissociated as a member when:

21 DISSOLUTION AND WINDING UP
22 7-16.1-701. Events causing dissolution.

25 (1) An event or circumstance that the operating agreement states causes dissolution;

1 (1) In an action by a member when it is established that, whether or not the company's
2 business has been or could be operated at a profit, dissolution would be beneficial to the members

13 (i) The company is not able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of its
14 business; or
15 (ii) The assets of the company are being misapplied or are in danger of being wasted or
16 lost;
17 (c) In a proceeding brought under subsection (b)(1) of this section, the court may order a
18 remedy other than dissolution.
19 (d) The following constitute prima facie evidence that the company is not able to pay its
20 debts as they become due in the usual course of its business:
21 (1) The petitioning creditor's claim has been reduced to judgment and an execution on the
22 judgment has been returned unsatisfied; or
23 (2) The limited liability company has admitted in a signed record that that the petitioning
24 creditor's claim is due and owing.
25 (e) Every petition filed by a creditor for the liquidation of the assets and business of a
26 limited liability company shall contain a statement as to whether the creditor is or is not a manager,
27 officer, director, or member of the company. Every petition for the liquidation of the assets and
28 business of a limited liability company filed by a manager, officer, director, or member of the
29 company or by a creditor who is a manager, officer, director or member, shall contain, to the best
30 of petitioner's knowledge, information, and belief, the names and addresses of all known creditors
31 of any class of the company.
32 (f) It is not necessary to make members parties to any action or proceeding unless relief is
33 sought against them personally.
34 (g) The provisions of chapter 21 of title 10 entitled the "Rhode Island Commercial
LC002870 - Page 91 of 137

1 Receivership Act" apply in proceedings to liquidate the assets and business of a limited liability
2 company.
3 7-16.1-701.1. Avoidance of dissolution through buyout.
4 (a) In this section, "membership interest" means a member's rights in a limited liability
5 company, including the member's right to share profits and loses, the member's right to
6 distributions, and the right to vote or otherwise participate in management of the company.
7 (b) Whenever a petition for dissolution of a limited liability company is filed by one or
8 more members pursuant to §§ 7-16.1-701(b)(1) or 10-21-6(a)(3), one or more of its other members
9 may avoid the dissolution by filing with the court prior to the commencement of the hearing, or, in
10 the discretion of the court, at any time prior to a sale or other disposition of the assets of the
11 company, an election to purchase the membership interest owned by each petitioning member at a
12 price equal to their fair value.
13 (c) Notice shall be sent to all members of the company other than the petitioning members,
14 giving them an opportunity to join in the election to purchase the membership interests. If the
15 parties are unable to reach an agreement as to the fair value of the membership interests, the court
16 shall, upon the giving of a bond or other security sufficient to assure to each petitioning member
17 payment of the value of each petitioning member's membership interest, stay the proceeding and
18 determine the value of the membership interests as of the close of business on the day on which the
19 petition for dissolution was filed.
20 (d) Upon determining the fair value of the membership interests, the court shall state in its
21 order directing that the membership interests be purchased, the purchase price and the time within
22 which the payment is to be made, and may decree any other terms and conditions of sale that it
23 determines to be appropriate, including payment of the purchase price in installments extending
24 over a period of time, and, if the membership interests are to be purchased by more than one other
25 member, the allocation of membership interests among members electing to purchase them, which,
26 so far as practicable, are to be proportional to the membership interests previously owned.
27 (e) Each petitioning member is entitled to interest, at the rate on judgments in civil actions,
28 on the purchase price of the membership interests from the date of the filing of the election to
29 purchase the membership interests, and all other rights of each petitioning member as owner of the
30 membership interests terminate on that date. The costs of the proceeding, which include reasonable
31 compensation and expenses of appraisers but not fees and expenses of counsel or of experts retained
32 by a party, will be allocated between or among the parties as the court determines. Upon full
33 payment of the purchase price, under the terms and conditions specified by the court, or at any other
34 time that is ordered by the court, each petitioning member shall transfer the membership interests
LC002870 - Page 92 of 137

1 to the purchaser.
2 (f) Avoidance of dissolution through buyout under this section is not the exclusive means
3 of avoiding the dissolution of a limited liability company, and the absence or failure of the buyout
4 in accordance with this section does not, of itself, affect the validity or effectiveness of any
5 alternative action permitted under this chapter, under common law or otherwise, nor does it create
6 a presumption that the failure of the buyout restricts or prevents any alternative action for avoidance
7 of the dissolution.
8 7-16.1-702. Winding up.
9 (a) A dissolved limited liability company shall wind up its activities and affairs and, except
10 as otherwise provided in § 7-16.1-703, the company continues after dissolution only for the purpose
11 of winding up.
12 (b) In winding up its activities and affairs, a limited liability company:
13 (1) Shall discharge the company's debts, obligations, and other liabilities, settle and close
14 the company's activities and affairs, and marshal and distribute the assets of the company; and
15 (2) May:
16 (i) Preserve the company activities, affairs, and property as a going concern for a reasonable
17 time;
18 (ii) Prosecute and defend actions and proceedings, whether civil, criminal, or

24 obligations and as required by § 7-16.1-213, the limited liability company has paid all fees and
25 taxes, and that the company is dissolved; and
26 (vi) Perform other acts necessary or appropriate to the winding up.
27 (c) If a dissolved limited liability company has no members, the legal representative of the
28 last person to have been a member may wind up the activities and affairs of the company. If the
29 person does so, the person has the powers of a sole manager under § 7-16.1-407(c) and is deemed
30 to be a manager for the purposes of § 7-16.1-304(a).
31 (d) If the legal representative under subsection (c) of this section declines or fails to wind
32 up the limited liability company's activities and affairs, a person may be appointed to do so by the
33 consent of transferees owning a majority of the rights to receive distributions as transferees at the
34 time the consent is to be effective. A person appointed under this subsection:
LC002870 - Page 93 of 137

1 (1) Has the powers of a sole manager under § 7-16.1-407(c) and is deemed to be a manager
2 for the purposes of § 7-16.1-304(a); and
3 (2) Shall deliver promptly to the secretary of state for filing an amendment to the company's
4 certificate of organization stating:
5 (i) That the company has no members;
6 (ii) The name and street and mailing addresses of the person; and
7 (iii) That the person has been appointed pursuant to this subsection (d) to wind up the
8 company.
9 (e) The superior court may order judicial supervision of the winding up of a dissolved
10 limited liability company, including the appointment of a receiver to wind up the company's
11 activities and affairs:
12 (1) On the application of a member, if the applicant establishes good cause;
13 (2) On the application of a transferee, if:
14 (i) The company does not have any members;
15 (ii) The legal representative of the last person to have been a member declines or fails to
16 wind up the company's activities; and
17 (iii) Within a reasonable time following the dissolution, a person has not been appointed
18 pursuant to subsection (c) of this section; or
19 (3) In connection with a proceeding under § 7-16.1-701(b).
20 7-16.1-703. Rescinding dissolution.
21 (a) A limited liability company may, within one hundred twenty (120) days of its effective
22 date of the statement of dissolution rescind its dissolution, unless a statement of termination
23 applicable to the company has become effective or the superior court has entered an order under §
24 7-16.1-701(b) dissolving the company.
25 (b) Rescinding dissolution under this section requires:
26 (1) The affirmative vote or consent of each member; and
27 (2) If the limited liability company has delivered to the secretary of state for filing a
28 statement of dissolution and:
29 (i) The statement has not become effective, delivery to the secretary of state for filing of a
30 statement of withdrawal under § 7-16.1-208 applicable to the statement of dissolution; or
31 (ii) If the statement of dissolution has become effective, delivery to the secretary of state
32 for filing of a statement of rescission stating the name of the company and that dissolution has been
33 rescinded under this section.
34 (c) If a limited liability company rescinds its dissolution:
LC002870 - Page 94 of 137

1 (1) The company resumes carrying on its activities and affairs as if dissolution had never
2 occurred;
3 (2) Subject to subsection (c)(3) of this section, any liability incurred by the company after
4 the dissolution and before the rescission has becomes effective is determined as if dissolution had
5 never occurred; and
6 (3) The rights of a third party arising out of conduct in reliance on the dissolution before
7 the third party knew or had notice of the rescission may not be adversely affected.
8 7-16.1-704. Known claims against dissolved limited liability company.
9 (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d) of this section, a dissolved limited
10 liability company may give notice of a known claim under subsection (b) of this section, which has

20 (c) A claim against a dissolved limited liability company is barred if the requirements of

23 (2) If the claim is timely received but rejected by the company:
24 (i) The company causes the claimant to receive a notice in a record stating that the claim is

26 the claim not later than ninety (90) days after the claimant receives the notice; and
27 (ii) The claimant does not commence the required action not later than ninety (90) days
28 after the claimant receives the notice.
29 (d) This section does not apply to a claim based on an event occurring after the date of
30 dissolution or a liability that on that date is contingent.
31 7-16.1-705. Other claims against dissolved limited liability company.

16 (1) Against a dissolved limited liability company, to the extent of its undistributed assets;
17 and
18 (2) Except as otherwise provided in § 7-16.1-706, if assets of the company have been
19 distributed after dissolution, against a member or transferee to the extent of that person's
20 proportionate share of the claim or of the company's assets distributed to the member or transferee
21 after dissolution, whichever is less, but a person's total liability for all claims under this subsection

27 (a) Subject to subsection (b) of this section, a member may maintain a direct action against
28 another member, a manager, or the limited liability company to enforce the member's rights and
29 protect the member's interests, including rights and interests under the operating agreement or this
30 chapter or arising independently of the membership relationship.
31 (b) A member maintaining a direct action under this section shall plead and prove an actual
32 or threatened injury that is not solely the result of an injury suffered or threatened to be suffered by

34 7-16.1-802. Derivative action.
LC002870 - Page 100 of 137

1 A member may maintain a derivative action to enforce a right of a limited liability company
2 if:
3 (1) The member first makes a demand on the other members in a member-managed limited
4 liability company, or the managers of a manager-managed limited liability company, requesting
5 that they cause the company to bring an action to enforce the right, and the managers or other
6 members do not bring the action within a reasonable time; or
7 (2) A demand under subsection (1) of this section would be futile.
8 7-16.1-803. Proper plaintiff.
9 A derivative action to enforce a right of a limited liability company may be maintained
10 only by a person that is a member at the time the action is commenced and:
11 (1) Was a member when the conduct giving rise to the action occurred; or
12 (2) Whose status as a member devolved on the person by operation of law or pursuant to
13 the terms of the operating agreement from a person that was a member at the time of the conduct.
14 7-16.1-804. Pleading.
15 In a derivative action, the complaint shall state with particularity:
16 (1) The date and content of the plaintiff's demand and the response to the demand by the
17 managers or other members; or
18 (2) Why demand should be excused as futile.
19 7-16.1-805. Special litigation committee.
20 (a) If a limited liability company is named as or made a party in a derivative proceeding,
21 the company may appoint a special litigation committee to investigate the claims asserted in the
22 proceeding and determine whether pursuing the action is in the best interests of the company. If the
23 company appoints a special litigation committee, on motion by the committee made in the name of
24 the company, except for good cause shown, the court shall stay discovery for the time reasonably
25 necessary to permit the committee to make its investigation. This subsection does not prevent the
26 court from:
27 (1) Enforcing a person's right to information under § 7-16.1-410; or
28 (2) Granting extraordinary relief in the form of a temporary restraining order or preliminary
29 injunction.
30 (b) A special litigation committee shall be composed of one or more disinterested and
31 independent individuals, who may be members.
32 (c) A special litigation committee may be appointed:
33 (1) In a member-managed limited liability company:
34 (i) By the affirmative vote or consent of a majority of the members not named as parties in
LC002870 - Page 101 of 137

1 the proceeding; or
2 (ii) If all members are named as parties in the proceeding, by a majority of the members
3 named as defendants; or
4 (2) In a manager-managed limited liability company:
5 (i) By a majority of the managers not named as parties in the proceeding; or
6 (ii) If all managers are named as parties in the proceeding, by a majority of the managers
7 named as defendants.
8 (d) After appropriate investigation, a special litigation committee may determine that it is
9 in the best interests of the limited liability company that the proceeding:
10 (1) Continue under the control of the plaintiff;
11 (2) Continue under the control of the committee;
12 (3) Be settled on terms approved by the committee; or
13 (4) Be dismissed.
14 (e) After making a determination under subsection (d) of this section, a special litigation
15 committee shall file with the court a statement of its determination and its report supporting its
16 determination and shall serve each party with a copy of the determination and report. The court
17 shall determine whether the members of the committee were disinterested and independent and
18 whether the committee conducted its investigation and made its recommendation in good faith,
19 independently, and with reasonable care, with the committee having the burden of proof. If the
20 court finds that the members of the committee were disinterested and independent and that the
21 committee acted in good faith, independently, and with reasonable care, the court shall enforce the
22 determination of the committee. Otherwise, the court shall dissolve the stay of discovery entered
