RELATING TO WATERS AND NAVIGATION -- COASTAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
COUNCIL
Introduced By: Representatives Spears, Carson, Cortvriend, Boylan, and Speakman
Date Introduced: February 26, 2025
Referred To: House State Government & Elections
(CRMC)
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Sections 46-23-1 and 46-23-6 of the General Laws in Chapter 46-23 entitled
2 "Coastal Resources Management Council" are hereby amended to read as follows:
3 46-23-1. Legislative findings.
4 (a)(1) Under article 1, § 17 of the Rhode Island Constitution, the people shall continue to
5 enjoy and freely exercise all the rights of fishery, and the privileges of the shore, to which they
6 have been heretofore entitled under the charter and usages of this state, including, but not limited
7 to, fishing from the shore, the gathering of seaweed, leaving the shore to swim in the sea and
8 passage along the shore; and they shall be secure in their rights to use and enjoyment of the natural
9 resources of the state with due regard for the preservation of their values; and it is the duty of the
10 general assembly to provide for the conservation of the air, land, water, plant, animal, mineral and
11 other natural resources of the state, and to adopt all means necessary and proper by law to protect
12 the natural environment of the people of the state by providing adequate resource planning for the
13 control and regulation of the use of the natural resources of the state and for the preservation,
14 regeneration, and restoration of the natural environment of the state.
15 (2) The general assembly recognizes and declares that the coastal resources of Rhode
16 Island, a rich variety of natural, commercial, industrial, recreational, and aesthetic assets, are of
17 immediate and potential value to the present and future development of this state; that unplanned
18 or poorly planned development of this basic natural environment has already damaged or destroyed,

1 or has the potential of damaging or destroying, the state’s coastal resources, and has restricted the
2 most efficient and beneficial utilization of these resources; that it shall be the policy of this state to
3 preserve, protect, develop, and, where possible, restore the coastal resources of the state for this
4 and succeeding generations through comprehensive and coordinated long range planning and
5 management designed to produce the maximum benefit for society from these coastal resources;
6 and that preservation and restoration of ecological systems shall be the primary guiding principle
7 upon which environmental alteration of coastal resources will be measured, judged, and regulated.
8 (b)(1) That effective implementation of these policies is essential to the social and
9 economic well-being of the people of Rhode Island because the sea and its adjacent lands are major
10 sources of food and public recreation, because these resources are used by and for industry,
11 transportation, waste disposal, and other purposes, and because the demands made on these
12 resources are increasing in number, magnitude, and complexity; and that these policies are
13 necessary to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare. Pursuant to 16 U.S.C. § 1452
14 (“The Coastal Zone Management Act”), the general assembly hereby directs the council (referred
15 to as “CRMC”) to exercise effectively its responsibilities in the coastal zone through the
16 development and implementation of management programs to achieve wise use of the land and
17 water resources of the coastal zone.
18 (2) Furthermore, that implementation of these policies is necessary in order to secure the
19 rights of the people of Rhode Island to the use and enjoyment of the natural resources of the state
20 with due regard for the preservation of their values, and in order to allow the general assembly to
21 fulfill its duty to provide for the conservation of the air, land, water, plant, animal, mineral, and
22 other natural resources of the state, and to adopt all means necessary and proper by law to protect
23 the natural environment of the people of the state by providing adequate resource planning for the
24 control and regulation of the use of the natural resources of the state and for the preservation,
25 regeneration, and restoration of the natural environment of the state.
26 (c) That these policies can best be achieved through the creation of a coastal resources
27 management council as the principal mechanism for management of the state’s coastal resources.
28 (d) The general assembly recognizes and declares that maintenance dredging is required to
29 remove natural silt accumulations; Rhode Island has not had a general maintenance dredging policy
30 and programs for ports, port facilities, channels, harbors, public and private marinas and boating
31 facilities, recreational facilities and habitat areas; other major coastal states have maintenance
32 dredging policies and in-water maintenance dredge disposal sites; as a result of the lack of a general
33 maintenance dredging policy and program and as a result there has been:
34 (1) A decrease in the depth of the Providence Channel from forty-four (44) feet in 1971 to
LC001774 - Page 2 of 15

1 twenty-four (24) feet in 1996;
2 (2) Navigational restrictions on ocean going vessels through the state’s waterways and
3 channels; and
4 (3) A decrease in the number of available slips and moorings at marinas throughout the
5 state; and the lack of a maintenance dredging policy and programs have significant adverse
6 environmental and economic effects on the state and therefore it is in the best interest of the state,
7 the cities and towns of the state, and the citizens thereof for the state to have a general maintenance
8 dredging policy and programs to resolve issues related to dredge maintenance and disposal and
9 avoid future significant direct and indirect adverse impact on the environment and economy of the
10 state.
11 (e) The coastal resources management council is hereby designated as the lead state agency
12 for purposes of dredging in tidal waters and as such shall have the following duties and
13 responsibilities:
14 (1) To coordinate the interest of the state with regard to dredging;
15 (2) To formulate and adopt a state policy with regard to dredging which integrates those
16 interests;
17 (3) To cooperate with, negotiate, and to enter into agreements on behalf of the state with
18 the federal government and with other public bodies and private parties with regard to dredging;
19 (4) To act as the initial and primary point of contact for all applications to the state for
20 dredging projects in tidal waters;
21 (5) To develop, prepare, adopt pursuant to § 46-23-11, implement, and maintain a
22 comprehensive plan for dredge material management; and
23 (6) To cooperate and coordinate with the departments of environmental management,
24 transportation, administration, and health, and the economic development corporation in the
25 conduct of these duties and responsibilities.
26 (f)(1) The legislature recognizes that under Article I, § 17, the submerged lands of the state
27 are impressed with a public trust and that the state is responsible for the protection of the public’s
28 interest in these lands. The state maintains title in fee to all soil within its boundaries that lies below
29 the high water mark, and it holds that land in trust for the use of the public. In benefiting the public,
30 the state preserves certain public rights which include, but are not limited to, fishery, commerce,
31 and navigation in these waters and the submerged lands that they cover.
32 (2) Since its establishment in 1971, the CRMC has had the authority to manage and plan
33 for the preservation of the coastal resources of the state including, but not limited to, submerged
34 lands. The legislature hereby declares that, in light of the unique size, scope, and overall potential
LC001774 - Page 3 of 15

1 impact upon the environment of large scale filling projects involving twenty-five (25) acres or
2 more, or any and all projects involving the lease of tidal lands of twenty-five (25) acres or more,
3 any lease of tidal lands, or any license to use those lands, is subject to approval, disapproval, or
4 conditional approval by the direct enactment of the general assembly by legislative action. The
5 CRMC shall review all requests for leases, licenses to use the land, and other authority to use the
6 land made by any applicant prior to presentation of the request to the general assembly, and the
7 CRMC shall make recommendations on the request to the general assembly. An appropriate fee for
8 such use and/or lease may be recommended.
9 (ii) With the exception of any and all projects to fill land of twenty-five (25) acres or more,
10 or any and all projects involving the lease of tidal lands of twenty-five (25) acres or more, the
11 general assembly hereby recognizes and declares that the CRMC is delegated the sole and exclusive
12 authority for the leasing of submerged and filled lands and giving licenses for the use of that land.
13 Accordingly, the CRMC will develop, coordinate, and adopt a system for the leasing of submerged
14 and filled lands, and licenses for the use of that land, and will ensure that all leases and licenses are
15 consistent with the public trust. Pursuant thereto, the
16 (iii) The CRMC shall impose a maximum fee of eighty thousand dollars ($80,000) per
17 annum for any transatlantic telephone or fiber-optic communication cable that makes landfall in
18 Rhode Island. All such fees collected shall be deposited into the Bays, Rivers and Watersheds Fund,
19 established pursuant to § 46-31-12.1, and shall be disbursed according to the purposes of that fund.
20 (iv) Nothing contained in this subsection negates, repeals, or alters the provisions,
21 processes, and requirements for the leasing of submerged land for the conduct of aquaculture as set
22 out under chapter 10 of title 20. Therefore, nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit or
23 impair the authority of the state, or any duly established agency of the state, to regulate filling or
24 dredging affecting tidal lands owned by the state or any other entity, and nothing in this chapter
25 shall be construed to limit or impair the obligation of the applicant to obtain all applicable
26 regulatory approvals. Specifically, and without limiting the foregoing, nothing in this subsection
27 negates, repeals, or alters the provisions, processes, and requirements for water quality certification
28 contained in chapter 12 of this title.
29 (3) Definitions.
30 (i) “Filled land” means portions of tidal lands which have been rendered by the acts of man
31 to be no longer subject to tidal action or beneath tidal waters.
32 (ii) “Tidal Lands” means those lands that are below the mean high water.
33 (iii) “Mean high water” means a line of contour representing the 18.6 year average as
34 determined by the metonic cycle and/or its equivalent as evidenced by the records, tidal datum, and

31 (F) Sewage treatment and disposal and solid waste disposal facilities.
32 (G) Beneficial use, dewatering, and disposal of dredged material of marine origins, where
33 such activities take place within two hundred feet (200′) of mean high water or a coastal
34 physiographic feature, or where there is a reasonable probability of conflict with a plan or program
LC001774 - Page 9 of 15

1 for resources management or damage to the coastal environment.
2 (iv) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (ii) and (iii) above, the department of
3 environmental management shall maintain jurisdiction over the administration of chapter 1, title 2,
4 including permitting of freshwater wetlands alterations and enforcement, with respect to all
5 agricultural activities undertaken by a farmer, as that term is defined in § 2-1-22(j), wherever
6 located; provided, however, that with respect to activities located partially or completely within
7 two hundred feet (200′) of the coastal physiographic feature, the department shall exercise
8 jurisdiction in consultation with the council.
9 (3) Coordination. The council has the following coordinating powers and duties:
10 (i) Functioning as a binding arbitrator in any matter of dispute involving both the resources
11 of the state’s coastal region and the interests of two (2) or more municipalities or state agencies.

18 other state agencies as they pertain to dredging in order to develop comprehensive programs for
19 dredging as required by subparagraph (1)(ii)(H) of this section and chapter 6.1 of this title. The
20 Rhode Island resource recovery corporation prior to purchasing cover material for the state landfill
21 shall first contact the CRMC to see if there is a source of suitable dredged material available which
22 shall be used in place of the purchase cover material. Other state agencies engaged in the process
23 of dump closures shall also contact the CRMC to see if there is a source of suitable dredged material
24 available, which shall be used in place of the purchase cover material. In addition, cities and towns
25 may contact the CRMC prior to closing city or town controlled dump sites to see if there is a source
26 of suitable dredge material available, which may be used in place of the purchase cover material.
27 (vi) Acting as the state’s representative to all bodies public and private on all coastal and
28 aquaculture related matters.
29 (4) Operations. The council is authorized to exercise the following operating functions,

9 program, but not including those facilities defined in 300.4 of the Rhode Island coastal resources
10 management program, and which is capable of offloading cargo, and is or will be subject to a new
11 use or a significant intensification of an existing use, to demonstrate that the commercial wharf or
12 pier is fit for that purpose. For the purposes of this subsection, a “commercial wharf or pier” means
13 a pier, bulkhead, wharf, docking facility, or underwater utilities. The council may order said owner
14 or operator to provide an engineering certification to the council’s satisfaction that the commercial
15 wharf or pier is fit for the new use or intensification of an existing use. If the council determines
16 that the commercial wharf or pier is not fit, it may order the owner or operator to undertake the
17 necessary work to make the commercial wharf or pier safe, within a reasonable time frame. If the
18 council determines that the commercial wharf or pier, because of its condition, is an immediate
19 threat to public health and safety it may order the commercial wharf or pier closed until the
20 necessary work to make the commercial wharf or pier safe has been performed and approved by
21 the council. All work performed must conform to the council’s management program. The council
22 is also given the authority to develop regulations to carry out this provision and to impose
23 administrative penalties of five thousand dollars ($5,000) per day up to a maximum of twenty
24 thousand dollars ($20,000) consistent with § 46-23-7.1 where there has been a violation of the
25 orders under this provision.
26 (5) Rights-of-way.(i) The council is responsible for the designation of all public rights-of-
27 way to the tidal water areas of the state, and shall carry on a continuing discovery of appropriate
28 public rights-of-way to the tidal water areas of the state.
29 (ii) The council shall maintain a complete file of all official documents relating to the legal
30 status of all public rights-of-way to the tidal water areas of the state.
31 (iii)(A) The council has the power to designate for acquisition and development, and
32 posting, and all other functions of any other department for tidal rights-of-way and land for tidal
33 rights-of-way, parking facilities, and other council related purposes.
34 (B) Further, the council has the power to develop and prescribe a standard sign to be used
LC001774 - Page 11 of 15

1 by the cities and towns to mark designated rights-of-way.
2 (iv) In conjunction with this subdivision, every state department controlling state-owned
3 land close to or adjacent to discovered rights-of-way is authorized to set out the land, or so much
4 of the land that may be deemed necessary for public parking.
5 (v) No use of land for public parking shall conflict with existing or intended use of the land,
6 and no improvement shall be undertaken by any state agency until detailed plans have been

14 (E) Public use;
15 (F) Any other public record or historical evidence such as maps and street indexes;
16 (G) Other evidence as set out in § 42-35-10.
17 (vii) A determination by the council that a parcel is a right-of-way shall be decided by
18 substantial evidence.
19 (viii) The council shall be notified whenever by the judgment of the governing body of a
20 coastal municipality, a public right-of-way to tidal water areas located in such municipality has
21 ceased to be useful to the public, and such governing body proposes an order of abandonment of
22 such public right-of-way. Said notice shall be given not less than sixty (60) days prior to the date
23 of such abandonment.
24 (6) Pre-existing residential boating facilities.(i) The council is hereby authorized and
25 empowered to issue assent for pre-existing residential boating facilities constructed prior to January
26 1, 1985. These assents may be issued for pre-existing residential boating facilities, even though
27 such facilities do not meet current standards and policies of the council; provided, however, that
28 the council finds that such facilities do not pose any significant risk to the coastal resources of the
29 state of Rhode Island and do not endanger human safety.
30 (ii) In addition to the above criteria, the applicant shall provide clear and convincing
31 evidence that:
32 (A) The facility existed in substantially the same configuration as it now exists prior to
33 January 1, 1985;
34 (B) The facility is presently intact and functional; and
LC001774 - Page 12 of 15

1 (C) The facility presents no significant threat to the coastal resources of the state of Rhode
2 Island or human safety.
3 (iii) The applicant, to be eligible for this provision, shall apply no later than January 31,
4 1999.
5 (iv) The council is directed to develop rules and regulations necessary to implement this
6 subdivision.
7 (v) It is the specific intent of this subsection to require that all pre-existing residential
8 boating facilities constructed on January 1, 1985, or thereafter conform to this chapter and the plans,
9 rules and regulations of the council.
10 (7) Lease of filled lands which were formerly tidal lands to riparian or littoral owners.(i)
11 Any littoral or riparian owner in this state who desires to obtain a lease from the state of Rhode
12 Island of any filled lands adjacent to his or her upland shall apply to the council, which may make
13 the lease. Any littoral or riparian owner who wishes to obtain a lease of filled lands must obtain
14 pre-approval, in the form of an assent, from the council. Any lease granted by the council shall
15 continue the public’s interest in the filled lands including, but not limited to, the rights of
16 navigation, fishery, and commerce. The public trust in the lands shall continue and run concurrently
17 with the leasing of the lands by the state to private individuals, corporations, or municipalities.
18 Upon the granting of a lease by the council, those rights consistent with the public trust and secured
19 by the lease shall vest in the lessee. The council may approve a lease of filled lands for an initial
20 term of up to fifty (50) years, with, or without, a single option to renew for an additional term of
21 up to fifty (50) years. An appropriate fee for such use and/or lease may be required.
22 (ii) Consistent with § 46-23-1(f) et seq., large-scale filling projects involving twenty-five
23 (25) acres or more, or any and all projects involving the lease of tidal lands of twenty-five (25)
24 acres or more, any lease of tidal lands, or any license to use those lands, is subject to approval,
25 disapproval, or conditional approval by the direct enactment of the general assembly by legislative
26 action.
27 (ii)(iii) The lessor of the lease, at any time, for cause, may by express act cancel and annul
28 any lease previously made to the riparian owner when it determines that the use of the lands is
29 violating the terms of the lease or is inconsistent with the public trust, or a fee for such lease has
30 not been paid, and upon cancellation the lands, and rights in the land so leased, shall revert to the
31 state. Any fees paid shall not be returned.
32 (8) “Marinas” as defined in the coastal resources management program in effect as of June
33 1, 1997, are deemed to be one of the uses consistent with the public trust. Subdivision (7) is not
34 applicable to:
LC001774 - Page 13 of 15

1 (i) Any riparian owner on tidal waters in this state (and any successor in interest to the
2 owner) which has an assent issued by the council to use any land under water in front of his or her
3 lands as a marina, which assent was in effect on June 1, 1997;
4 (ii) Any alteration, expansion, or other activity at a marina (and any successor in interest)
5 which has an assent issued by the council, which assent was in effect on June 1, 1997; and
6 (iii) Any renewal of assent to a marina (or successor in interest), which assent was issued
7 by the council and in effect on June 1, 1997.
8 (9) “Recreational boating facilities” including marinas, launching ramps, and recreational
9 mooring areas, as defined by and properly permitted by the council, are deemed to be one of the
10 uses consistent with the public trust. Subdivision (7) is not applicable to:
11 (i) Any riparian owner on tidal waters in this state (and any successor in interest to the
12 owner) which has an assent issued by the council to use any land under water in front of his or her
13 lands as a recreational boating facility; any alteration, expansion or other activity at a recreational
14 boating facility (and any successor in interest) which has an assent issued by the council, which
15 assent was in effect as of June 1, 1997; and
16 (ii) Any renewal of assent to a recreational boating facility (or successor in interest), which
17 assent was issued by the council and in effect on June 1, 1997.
18 SECTION 2. This act shall take effect upon passage.
