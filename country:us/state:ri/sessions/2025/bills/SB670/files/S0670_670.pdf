RELATING TO HEALTH AND SAFETY -- THE MEDICAL PRIMARY CARE
SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM
Introduced By: Senators Lauria, Felag, Valverde, Euer, Ujifusa, DiMario, Lawson,
Pearson, and Murray
Date Introduced: March 07, 2025
Referred To: Senate Finance
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. The general assembly hereby makes the following findings of fact:
2 (1) Primary care healthcare in the State of Rhode Island is in crisis.
3 (2) There currently exists a national and regional shortage of primary care healthcare
4 providers.
5 (3) Many primary care healthcare providers are retiring early and many more are
6 approaching retirement age.
7 (4) Primary care healthcare is provided by physicians, nurse practitioners and physician
8 assistants and the overall numbers of medical professionals entering the field of primary
9 care
10 healthcare is declining.
11 (5) It is increasingly difficult for primary care practices to hire nurses, medical assistants,
12 behavioral health clinicians and other key staff, which is leading to even higher burnout
13 among
14 primary care providers.
15 (6) Fewer students are going into primary care as a profession due to lower salaries, high
16 student loans and increasing administrative burden leading to provider burnout.
17 (7) Our aging Rhode Island population requires more medical care.
18 (8) As a state, we must recruit, train, retain and sustain the number of primary care

1 providers sufficient to meet the population health needs of all Rhode Islanders.
2 (9) Investments in primary care are essential for access to health services, improving the
3 health of the population and reducing overall healthcare costs.
