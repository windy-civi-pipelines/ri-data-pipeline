It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Sections 27-38.2-1 and 27-38.2-2 of the General Laws in Chapter 27-38.2
2 entitled "Insurance Coverage for Mental Illness and Substance Use Disorders" are hereby amended
3 to read as follows:
4 27-38.2-1. Coverage for treatment of mental health and substance use disorders.
5 (a) A group health plan and an individual or group health insurance plan shall provide
6 coverage for the treatment of mental health and substance use disorders under the same terms and
7 conditions as that coverage is provided for other illnesses and diseases.
8 (b) Coverage for the treatment of mental health and substance use disorders shall not
9 impose any annual or lifetime dollar limitation.
10 (c) Financial requirements and quantitative treatment limitations on coverage for the
11 treatment of mental health and substance use disorders shall be no more restrictive than the
12 predominant financial requirements applied to substantially all coverage for medical conditions in
13 each treatment classification.
14 (d) Coverage shall not impose non-quantitative treatment limitations for the treatment of
15 mental health and substance use disorders unless the processes, strategies, evidentiary standards,
16 or other factors used in applying the non-quantitative treatment limitation, as written and in
17 operation, are comparable to, and are applied no more stringently than, the processes, strategies,
18 evidentiary standards, or other factors used in applying the limitation with respect to

1 medical/surgical benefits in the classification.
2 (e) The following classifications shall be used to apply the coverage requirements of this
3 chapter: (1) Inpatient, in-network; (2) Inpatient, out-of-network; (3) Outpatient, in-network; (4)

9 (g) Payors shall rely upon the criteria of the American Society of Addiction Medicine when
10 developing coverage for levels of care for substance use disorder treatment.
11 (h) Payors shall rely upon criteria which reflect generally accepted standards of care when
12 developing coverage for levels of care for mental health treatment.

14 below the level established by the generally accepted standards of care upon which their clinical
15 criteria are based.

17 treatment for pain, therefore coverage shall apply to medically necessary chiropractic care and
18 osteopathic manipulative treatment performed by an individual licensed under § 5-37-2.
19 (i)(k) Parity of cost-sharing requirements. Regardless of the professional license of the
20 provider of care, if that care is consistent with the provider’s scope of practice and the health plan’s
