9 This hotel tax is administered and collected by the division of taxation and unless provided to the

12 authority of the city of Providence established pursuant to the provisions of chapter 84 of the public

18 than two percent (2%), may also be levied. The local hotel tax shall be administered and collected

2 (c) All sums received by the division of taxation from the local hotel tax, penalties or
3 forfeitures, interest, costs of suit and fines shall be distributed at least quarterly, credited and paid
4 by the state treasurer to the city or town where the space for occupancy that is furnished by the
5 hotel is located. Unless provided to the contrary in this chapter, all of the administration, collection,
6 and other provisions of chapters 18 and 19 of this title shall apply.
7 (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the city of Newport
8 shall have the authority to collect from hotels located in the city of Newport the tax imposed by
9 subsection (a) of this section.

14 prior to the reporting date.
15 (2) The city of Newport shall have the same authority as the division of taxation to recover
16 delinquent hotel taxes pursuant to chapter 44-19, and the amount of any hotel tax, penalty and
17 interest imposed by the city of Newport until collected constitutes a lien on the real property of the
