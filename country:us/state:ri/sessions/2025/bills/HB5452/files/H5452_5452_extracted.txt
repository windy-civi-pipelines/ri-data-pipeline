3 42-72-5.2. Development of a continuum of children’s behavioral health programs.
4 (a) The departments of children, youth and families (DCYF) and human services (DHS)
5 shall cooperate to develop a design of a continuum of care for children’s behavioral health services
6 that encourages the use of alternative psychiatric and other services to hospitalization and reviews
7 the utilization of each service in order to better match services and programs to the needs of the

9 departments of children, youth and families and human services shall present a report to the
10 governor and the general assembly no later than February 1, 2006 that fully describes this
11 continuum of services and outlines a detailed plan for its implementation, including resource
12 requirements, responsibilities, milestones, and time frames, as well as a set of indicators and
13 program metrics that will be employed to evaluate its clinical and fiscal effectiveness over time.
14 The report shall also describe any and all changes proposed in program oversight or budgetary
15 responsibility for specific services. An important step towards the development of such continuum
16 of care is to assure the appropriate management of psychiatric hospitalizations. To that end the state
17 shall:
18 (1) Amend contractual agreements with RIte Care health plans to reflect complete
1 responsibility for the management of psychiatric hospitalizations, specifically the development of
2 hospital diversion and post discharge services; and the utilization of crisis intervention services as
3 a requirement for authorization of a psychiatric admission for all children enrolled in RIte Care;
4 and
5 (2) Issue a request for proposals to identify a contracted entity to reflect complete
6 responsibility for the management of psychiatric hospitalizations, specifically the development of
7 hospital diversion and post discharge services for crisis intervention services as a requirement for
8 authorization of a psychiatric admission for all Medicaid-eligible children not enrolled in RIte Care.
9 The request for proposals shall include a dispute resolution process.
10 (b) It shall be the public policy of the state that the department of children, youth and
11 families be the chief state agency responsible for all matters related to children's behavioral health
12 including, but not limited to, contracting with whatever agencies are necessary to provide and
13 implement these services.
14 SECTION 2. This act shall take effect upon passage.
