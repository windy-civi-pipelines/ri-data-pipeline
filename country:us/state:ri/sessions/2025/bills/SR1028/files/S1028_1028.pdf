PROCLAIMING MAY 5TH THROUGH MAY 9TH OF 2025, TO BE "TEACHER
APPRECIATION WEEK" IN THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND
Introduced By: Senators Gallo, Lawson, Gu, LaMountain, Sosnowski, Raptakis,
DiPalma, Murray, Rogers, and Paolino
Date Introduced: May 07, 2025
Referred To: Recommended for Immediate Consideration
1 WHEREAS, Every successful person in the Ocean State owes a great measure of their
2 achievement to the dedication and hard work of the teachers who inspired them to open their
3 minds to the magic of ideas, knowledge, and dreams, and find the very best in themselves; and
4 WHEREAS, Learning is a process of discovery. Teachers across this country utilize
5 innovative and dynamic methods to inspire young people to be curious about the world around
6 them, to explore ways to better understand their environment, and to develop the critical thinking
7 skills necessary for their success as adults; and
8 WHEREAS, Cities and Towns in Rhode Island employ approximately 21,000 public
9 school teachers, administrators and staff. These professionals consistently demonstrate laudable
10 commitment and competence through their willingness to provide the time, energy, talent, and
11 ideas to ensure that Rhode Island’s 143,000 students have the opportunity to fulfill all of their
12 potential; and
13 WHEREAS, Teachers spend countless hours preparing lessons, evaluating progress,
14 counseling and coaching students, consulting with parents, and performing community service.
15 Teachers also fill vital roles in the lives of many young people, often as listeners, role models,
16 explorers, motivators, and mentors; and
17 WHEREAS, Teachers keep democracy alive and vibrant by laying the foundation for
18 good citizenship. They display daily the value of public service. Their hard work and efforts are
19 directly responsible for creating the leaders of tomorrow; and

1 WHEREAS, Many of us are who we are because at least one teacher in the past ignited a
2 spark within us. They touch and mold the lives of our children and they have earned, and truly
3 deserve, the gratitude and respect of students, parents, and community members throughout the
4 state; now, therefore be it
5 RESOLVED, That this Senate of the State of Rhode Island hereby proclaims May 5th
6 through May 9th of 2025, to be “Teacher Appreciation Week” in Rhode Island. We heartily thank
7 all of Rhode Island’s teachers for their tireless devotion in educating and developing our children;
8 and be it further
9 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
10 transmit duly certified copies of this resolution to Maribeth Calabro, President of the Rhode
11 Island Federation of Teachers and Health Professionals, and the Honorable Valerie Lawson,
12 President of the National Education Association of Rhode Island.
