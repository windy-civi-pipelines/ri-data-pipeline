Introduced By: Representatives Edwards, McGaw, Diaz, Costantino, Ackerman, and

Date Introduced: February 26, 2025
Referred To: House Labor
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Section 25-3-1 of the General Laws in Chapter 25-3 entitled "Work on

3 25-3-1. Definitions.
4 As used in this chapter:
5 (1) “Director” means the director of the department of labor and training.
6 (2) “Economic necessity” means and refers to any case where the director determines that:
7 (i) Both the economics and technology of manufacture of the product or a component of
8 the product requires continuous conversion or processing of raw materials, intermediates, or
9 components without interruption to avoid disproportionate loss of production capacity;
10 (ii) The economics and technology of data processing requires the continuous operation of
11 data processing equipment to avoid deterioration of equipment or a disproportionate loss of
12 computer capacity or where customer requirements are that data processing equipment must be
13 available for input or output on a continuous basis;
14 (iii) Because prevailing industry practice in the manufacturing or processing of the product
15 or in the provision of banking or financial services is to operate facilities within that industry seven
16 (7) days per week, the failure to operate on one or more Sundays or holidays will subject the
17 employer to a competitive hardship within the industry in which the employer competes;
18 (iv) Maintenance or improvement of plant or equipment cannot practically or efficiently
1 be performed while production is in process;
2 (v) The scheduling of production on Sundays or holidays is necessitated by interrupted or
3 allocated energy supplies, or shortages of raw materials or component parts;
4 (vi) An employer has been deprived of its normal production schedule by fire, flood, power
5 failure, or other circumstances beyond its control; or
6 (vii) Circumstances, temporary in nature, are that undue economic hardship would result
7 from the inability to operate on one or more Sundays or holidays.
8 (3) “Employee” means any individual employed by an employer, but shall not include:
9 (i) Any individual employed in agriculture or maritime trades, including commercial
10 fishing or boat repairs;
11 (ii) Any physician, dentist, attorney at law, or accountant;
12 (iii) Any individual engaged in the provision of health care or maintenance;

14 recreational facility (except health clubs and casinos);

18 pursuant to that section;
19 (vii) Any individual employed by an employer holding a license issued pursuant to chapter
20 23 of title 5; or

22 operations, and ancillary services related to those services and operations, except for specific
23 employment positions in the telecommunications industry that are part of any collective bargaining
24 agreement or employment contract in effect on July 2, 1998.
25 (4) “Employer” means any natural person, partnership, firm, corporation, or other
26 enterprise engaged in industry, transportation, communication, or any other commercial occupation
27 involving one or more employees.
