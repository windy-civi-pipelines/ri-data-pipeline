Referred To: House read and passed
1 WHEREAS, It is with sadness that this House has learned of the passing of Dorothy Jean
2 McCaffrey. Fondly known by all as “Dottie”, she was an unforgettable woman of great generosity
3 and devotion to her family and neighborhood; and
4 WHEREAS, Dorothy McCaffrey was the beloved daughter of the late Hugh and
5 Margaret McCaffrey, and the sister of Barbara Marandola Yates and Karin Abbruzzese. Her
6 extended family included her niece, Leslie Marandola DiNanno and husband, David, her
7 nephews, Mark Marandola and his wife, Sandra, and John Abbruzzese and his wife, Houda, and
8 her great-nieces and nephews, Nicholas DiNanno, Anthony DiNanno and his wife, Laura,
9 Catherine DiNanno, Jenna Marandola, Mark Marandola, Brian Marandola, Marco Abbruzzese,
10 and Lorenzo Abbruzzese; and
11 WHEREAS, Dottie McCaffrey was a protector of the vulnerable and a champion for
12 those in need. Wearing many hats over the course of her lifetime, she had worked as a meter
13 maid, a crossing guard, and most notably as the administrative assistant to Fire Chief George
14 Farrell. In addition, she ran a women’s clothing boutique, a ceramics business, and "McCaffrey
15 and McKivergan’s" restaurant with her longtime companion, Alys Jaques; and
16 WHEREAS, An honest woman who never shied away from offering her opinion, Dottie
17 McCaffrey was a remarkable entertainer and hostess. The basement in her home became the
18 celebrated “Backstreet Pub”, which featured a player piano, Broadway posters, and a karaoke
19 mic, on which Dottie often exuberantly performed her legendary political ballads, homemade
1 ditties, and country tunes; and
2 WHEREAS, Renowned throughout the neighborhood for her fabulous and colorful attire,
3 and her animal advocacy, particularly her beloved Pretty Kitty, Dottie McCaffrey was equally
4 devoted to community action. She co-founded the Concerned Citizens of Mount Pleasant, that
5 assisted in the preservation of the Ryan Post Building, and she helped to establish the Mount
6 Pleasant Memorial Park; and
7 WHEREAS, A dear friend to many in the community as well as her family, Dottie
8 McCaffrey had been lovingly supported by her tenant and dear friend, Br. Roger Chingas, her
9 devoted friends at Uncle Tony’s, and her longtime and cherished friend of 45 years, the
10 Honorable Joanne Giannini; and
11 WHEREAS, Dottie McCaffrey was known for her boldness and laughter, her fearless
12 honesty, generous heart, and deep devotion to her neighborhood. She was a loving sister, aunt,
13 friend and neighbor who made an unforgettable impact on all who crossed her path and she is
14 dearly missed; now, therefore be it
15 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
16 extends deepest condolences on the passing of Dorothy Jean McCaffrey; and be it further
17 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
18 transmit duly certified copies of this resolution to Barbara Marandola Yates and Family, and
