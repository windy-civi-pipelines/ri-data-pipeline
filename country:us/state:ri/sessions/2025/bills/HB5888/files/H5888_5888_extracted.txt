It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Section 12-29-5 of the General Laws in Chapter 12-29 entitled "Domestic

3 12-29-5. Disposition of domestic violence cases.
4 (a) Every person convicted of, or placed on probation for, a crime involving domestic

7 attend, at his or her own expense, a batterer’s intervention program appropriate to address his or
8 her violent behavior; provided, however, that the court may permit a servicemember or veteran to
9 complete any court-approved counseling program administered or approved by the Veterans’

28 minimum standards, pursuant to §§ 12-29-5.1, 12-29-5.2, and 12-29-5.3.
