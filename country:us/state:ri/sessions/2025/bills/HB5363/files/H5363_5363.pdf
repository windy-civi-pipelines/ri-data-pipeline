32 unless the circumstances of the case require additional time, in which case the attorney general
33 shall notify the petitioner in writing and with specificity within the sixty (60) day period that the

13 accordance with this chapter.
14 (9) If the petition is denied, the attorney general shall prepare a written declaration of
15 forfeiture to the state and dispose of the property in accordance with this chapter and the attorney
16 general’s regulations, if any, pursuant to this chapter.

30 try the case shall enter upon judgment for the forfeiture and disposition of the property according
31 to law.
32 (2) An appeal may be claimed by either party from any judgment of forfeiture rendered by
33 the district court, to be taken in like manner as by defendants in criminal cases within the
34 jurisdiction of the district court to try and determine, to the superior court for the same county in
LC000838 - Page 4 of 7

1 which the division of the district court rendering judgment is situated and like proceedings may be
2 had therein as in cases of informations for forfeitures originally filed in that court.

5 cause shown by the supreme court.
6 (k) The in rem action shall be brought in the district court if the value of the property seized
7 is less than two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000), otherwise the in rem action shall be
8 brought in the superior court. The attorney general shall also, to the extent practicable, provide
9 written notice of the action in rem to all known interested parties and all persons whose identity is

11 (l) Persons claiming an interest in the property may file claims against the property within
12 thirty (30) days of the final notice by publication or receipt of written notice, whichever is earlier.
13 The claims shall be filed and adjudicated in the manner set forth for petitions in criminal
14 proceedings in § 21-28-5.04.1(f).
15 (m) If the property sought to be forfeited is real property, the attorney general shall file a
16 complaint in rem in the superior court against the property. In addition to providing notice as
17 required by this chapter, the attorney general shall file a lis pendens with respect to the property
18 with the recorder of deeds in the city or town in which the property is located.
19 (n) Upon order of the court forfeiting the subject property to the state, the state shall have
20 clear title to the forfeited property, and the attorney general may transfer good and sufficient title
21 to any subsequent purchaser or transferee. Title to the forfeited property shall be deemed to have
22 vested in the state upon the commission of the act giving rise to the forfeiture under this chapter.
23 (o) Upon entry of judgment for the claimant in any proceeding to forfeit property under
24 this chapter, the property shall immediately be returned to the claimant. If it appears that there was
25 reasonable cause for the seizure or the filing of the complaint, the court shall cause a proper
26 certificate of that to be entered, and the claimant shall not, in that case, be entitled to costs or
27 damages, nor shall the person or agency who made the seizure, nor the attorney general nor the
28 prosecutor, be liable to suit or judgment on account of the seizure, suit, or prosecution.
29 (p) In any action brought under this section, the state shall have the initial burden of
30 showing the existence of probable cause for seizure or arrest of the property. Upon that showing
31 by the state, the claimant shall have the burden of showing by a preponderance of evidence that the
32 property was not subject to forfeiture under this section.
