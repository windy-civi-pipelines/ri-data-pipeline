RELATING TO LABOR AND LABOR RELATIONS -- WAREHOUSE WORKER
PROTECTION ACT
Introduced By: Representatives Shanley, Craven, O'Brien, Dawson, Solomon, McEntee,
Corvese, Fellela, Kennedy, and Edwards
Date Introduced: January 15, 2025
Referred To: House Labor
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Legislative findings.
2 The general assembly finds and declares the following:
3 (1) The rapid growth of just-in-time logistics and same- and next-day consumer package
4 delivery, and advances in technology used for tracking employee productivity, have led to a rise in
5 the number of warehouse and distribution center workers, who are subject to quantified work
6 quotas.
7 (2) Warehouse and distribution center employees who work under those quotas are
8 expected to complete a quantified number of tasks within specific time periods, often measured
9 down to the minute or second, and face adverse employment action, including suspension or
10 termination, if they fail to do so.
11 (3) Those quotas generally do not allow for workers to comply with safety guidelines or to
12 recover from strenuous activity during productive work time, leaving warehouse and distribution
13 center employees who work under them at high risk of injury and illness.
14 (4) The quotas under which warehouse and distribution center employees regularly work
15 also affect their compensation. California and many cities require employers to pay their employees
16 a minimum-wage rate. Warehouse and distribution center employees who work under a quota,
17 however, do not receive the full benefit of minimum wages if their quota is increased to make up
18 for the direct or indirect effect of a minimum-wage increase.

1 (5) Quotas in occupations that are already physically demanding not only increase
2 accidents, but they also incentivize unsafe work. The workforce in warehouse and logistics is
3 largely comprised of people of color who depend upon these jobs to provide for their families and
4 often see no alternative but to prioritize quota compliance over their own safety. These workers
5 end up working faster than is healthy in order to keep their jobs.
6 (6) Workplace injuries can take a terrible toll on workers, their families and their
7 communities, and can create substantial costs for employers. According to the most recent data
8 (2020) released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the warehouse industry itself reports a rate of
9 serious work-related injuries involving lost time or restricted duty (4.0 cases/100 full-time workers)
10 that is more than twice the average injury rates for all private industry (1.7 cases/100 full-time
11 workers). The most common types of work-related serious injury reported by employers in the
12 warehouse sector are musculoskeletal injuries, which often require workers to miss work and can
13 force workers permanently out of the job and even out of the workforce.
14 SECTION 2. Title 28 of the General Laws entitled "LABOR AND LABOR RELATIONS"
15 is hereby amended by adding thereto the following chapter:
16 CHAPTER 61
