Date Introduced: May 08, 2025
Referred To: House read and passed
1 WHEREAS, National Nurses Week is held May 6th through May 12th in order to
2 coincide with and celebrate Florence Nightingale's birthday on the 12th. She was a nurse who
3 became famous for treating wounded soldiers during the Crimean War, and for her efforts in
4 establishing nursing as a profession. She was affectionately known as "The Lady with the Lamp"
5 because during the war, she made a lot of her ward rounds at night whilst carrying a lamp; and
6 WHEREAS, This week is a time to acknowledge, honor, and express our heartfelt
7 gratitude to Rhode Island's brave, dedicated, and determined nurses who day after day and month
8 after month care for us; and
9 WHEREAS, Registered nurses in the United States constitute this Nation's largest
10 healthcare profession; and
11 WHEREAS, The depth and breadth of the registered nursing profession met and
12 exceeded the different and emerging healthcare needs of the American population during the
13 pandemic and in a wide range of settings; and
14 WHEREAS, The American Nurses Association, as the voice for registered nurses across
15 this country, is working to chart a new course for a healthy Nation that relies on increasing
16 delivery of primary and preventive healthcare and requiring better utilization of all our Nation's
17 registered nursing resources; and
18 WHEREAS, Professional nursing has demonstrated itself to be an indispensable
19 component in providing safety and quality of care for hospitalized patients; and
1 WHEREAS, The demand for registered nursing services is greater than ever, due to the
2 aging of the American population, the continuing expansion of life-sustaining technologies, the
3 explosive growth of home healthcare services, and the need to develop coordinated networking to
4 prevent and contain new and emergent widespread infectious diseases; and
5 WHEREAS, More qualified registered nurses will be needed in the future to meet the
6 increasingly complex needs of healthcare consumers in this country and across the world; and
7 WHEREAS, The cost-effective, safe, and high-quality healthcare services provided by
8 registered nurses will be an increasingly important component of the United States healthcare
9 delivery system in the future; now, therefore be it
10 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
11 joins the American Nurses Association in celebrating May 6th through May 12th, 2025, as
12 "National Nurses Week"; and be it further
13 RESOLVED, That this House moreover urges all the residents of the State to join in
14 honoring and thanking the registered nurses who have selflessly cared for us all, and to celebrate
15 their efforts and accomplishments in improving our healthcare system, not just during this week,
16 but at every opportunity throughout the year; and be it further
17 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
18 transmit duly certified copies of this resolution to the American Nurses Association, the United
