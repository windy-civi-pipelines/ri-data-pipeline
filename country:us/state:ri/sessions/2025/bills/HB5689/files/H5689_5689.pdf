33 comprehensive community plan with particular emphasis on the community’s affordable housing
34 plan and/or has satisfactorily addressed the issues where there may be inconsistencies.
LC001296 - Page 8 of 16

1 (II) The proposed development is in compliance with the standards and provisions of the
2 municipality’s zoning ordinance and subdivision regulations, and/or where adjustments are
3 requested by the applicant, that local concerns that have been affected by the relief granted do not
4 outweigh the state and local need for low- and moderate-income housing.
5 (III) All low- and moderate-income housing units proposed are integrated throughout the
6 development; are compatible in scale and architectural style to the market rate units within the
7 project; and will be built and occupied prior to, or simultaneous with the construction and
8 occupancy of any market rate units.
9 (IV) There will be no significant negative impacts on the local needs including, but not
10 limited to, the public school system, public transportation, and public infrastructure in a

17 permanent physical access to a public street in accordance with the requirements of § 45-23-
18 60(a)(5).
19 (VI) The proposed development will not result in the creation of individual lots with any
20 physical constraints to development that building on those lots according to pertinent regulations
21 and building standards would be impracticable, unless created only as permanent open space or
22 permanently reserved for a public purpose on the approved, recorded plans.
23 (F) Required findings for denial. In reviewing the comprehensive permit request, the
24 local review board may deny the request for any of the following reasons: (I) If the city or town

27 the municipality has made significant progress in implementing that housing plan; (II) The proposal
28 is not consistent with local needs, including, but not limited to, the impact on the public school
29 system, public transportation, and public infrastructure in a community, the needs identified in an
30 approved comprehensive plan, and/or local zoning ordinances and procedures promulgated in
31 conformance with the comprehensive plan; (III) The proposal is not in conformance with the
32 comprehensive plan; (IV) The community has met or has plans to meet the goal of ten percent
33 (10%) of the year-round units or, in the case of an urban town or city, fifteen percent (15%) of the
34 occupied rental housing units as defined in § 45-53-3(5)(i) being low- and moderate-income
LC001296 - Page 9 of 16

28 years; and
29 (D) Those items required by local regulations promulgated pursuant to applicable state law
