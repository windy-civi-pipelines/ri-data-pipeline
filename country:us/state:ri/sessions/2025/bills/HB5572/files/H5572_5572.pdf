4 the time it was damaged;
5 (iv) If condition adjustments are made to the retail value of a motor vehicle designated a

9 including prior damage deductions, must be itemized, fair, and reasonable; and
10 (v) When a vehicle is deemed a total loss, if the insurer is not retaining the salvage, the
11 insurer must notify the owner of the vehicle in writing of the requirements of obtaining both a
12 salvage title and a reconstructed title from the department of motor vehicles pursuant to chapter 1
13 of title 31, and must obtain, in writing, the owner’s consent and acknowledgement that the insurer
