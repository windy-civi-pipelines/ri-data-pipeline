RELATING TO PROPERTY -- RESIDENTIAL TENANT'S RIGHT TO LEGAL
REPRESENTATION ACT
Introduced By: Senators Mack, Euer, Gu, Bell, Acosta, Zurier, and Bissaillon
Date Introduced: February 26, 2025
Referred To: Senate Judiciary
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Legislative findings.
2 The general assembly hereby finds and declares that:
3 (1) Eviction proceedings have a profoundly disparate impact on low- to moderate-income
4 individuals. A recent study has shown that half of United States citizens are cost burdened by the
5 skyrocketing rents and increased risk to homelessness and given this disparate impact, it is
6 imperative that these individuals be provided legal representation in legal proceedings that put their
7 housing at risk.
8 (2) There is a fundamental human right to adequate housing accommodations. Safe, secure,
9 and accessible housing is essential to achieving equal access to all other fundamental needs.
10 Without housing, individuals and families too often cannot preserve family integrity, gain
11 employment or other income, or enjoy access to healthcare, proper nutrition, and education.
12 (3) Eviction proceedings and displacement as a result of evictions have a disparate impact
13 on low- to moderate-income individuals and particularly on low- to moderate-income people of
14 color, who are disproportionately the respondents in eviction proceedings.
15 (4) Representation of people who are at risk of losing their homes in legal proceedings
16 preserves access to housing and ensures compliance with laws protecting people's rights in such
17 proceedings. Abrupt, unwarranted, or unlawful evictions disrupt lives and livelihoods, force people
18 to find housing in a market with a severe shortage of affordable housing and often significantly

1 increases the risk of homelessness. The short- and long-term effects of housing instability are
2 devastating to individuals and families and can affect physical and mental health, employment and
3 education.
4 (5) Providing a right to legal representation to individuals who are most at risk of housing
5 instability not only protects individuals and families from these devastating effects, but also saves
6 public funds that would otherwise be spent on shelters and services to people experiencing
7 homelessness as well as the wide range of detrimental short- and long-term collateral consequences
8 of housing instability.
9 SECTION 2. Title 34 of the General Laws entitled "PROPERTY" is hereby amended by
10 adding thereto the following chapter:

22 I have a written lease which does not expire until:
23 I have not received the required notice from the landlord before this complaint was served
24 on me.

26 enforcement officials, or by taking the following protected action:

EXPLANATION
BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL
OF
A N A C T
RELATING TO PROPERTY -- RESIDENTIAL TENANT'S RIGHT TO LEGAL
REPRESENTATION ACT
***
1 This act would create the division of civil representation within the department of housing
2 and require a designated legal organization to provide legal representation to all tenants who qualify
3 in eviction proceedings. The act would also provide that notice of a tenant’s right to legal
4 representation be included in all residential landlord/tenant complaint forms and that any attempt
5 to waive that right in a lease would be void.
6 This act would take effect upon passage.
