RHODE ISLAND IN HONOR OF ROSA PARKS AND HER HISTORIC FIGHT FOR
EQUITABLE PUBLIC TRANSIT
Introduced By: Representatives Morales, Shekarchi, Blazejewski, Biah, Stewart, Cruz,
Giraldo, Furtado, Batista, and Cortvriend
Date Introduced: February 05, 2025
Referred To: House Special Legislation
1 WHEREAS, Transit Equity Day is the collaborative effort of Civil Rights Leaders,
2 Environmental Organizations, Labor Unions and Laborers who are working together to bring
3 awareness about the critical importance that robust public transportation has to all members of
4 our community and to galvanize people to support equitable and sustainable public transit; and
5 WHEREAS, The day chosen for this event is the birthday of Rosa Parks, an iconic figure
6 during the civil rights movement for refusing to give up her seat on the bus, and thus signifies the
7 connection between her act of resistance to the essential need to fight for a truly equitable transit
8 system and the rights of all people to high-quality public transportation; and
9 WHEREAS, To honor and celebrate Rosa Parks' life and legacy, many public transit
10 systems across the country have reserved a seat in respect of this civil rights hero with a rose and
11 her picture occupying an empty seat on public buses; and
12 WHEREAS, Public transit provides basic mobility for many in our communities. It is
13 also as essential an urban infrastructure as are roads, bridges, tunnels and utilities, and is crucial
14 to the economic, social and environmental well-being of our State; and
15 WHEREAS, Investments in the public transit workforce, in addition to providing better
16 service, boosts local economies, expands opportunity and racial equity, and increases
17 environmental sustainability by reducing climate emissions; and
18 WHEREAS, Affordable public transit, that reliably connects people in all communities to
19 their home, work, school, places of worship, shopping, health, and recreation, in an efficient,
1 sustainable and timely manner, is crucial to the economic growth of this State and to ensure that
2 no community, regardless of income, national origin, race, gender identity, sexual orientation,
3 age, religion, or ability, is left behind; now, therefore be it
4 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
5 proclaims February 4, 2025, as "Transit Equity Day" in honor of Rosa Parks and to bring
6 awareness to the public to support equitable and sustainable public transit; and be it further
7 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
8 transmit duly certified copies of this resolution to the Rhode Island Department of
9 Administration, RIPTA, the RI Transit Riders, the George Wiley Center, Grow Smart RI, and
10 Labor 4 Sustainability.
