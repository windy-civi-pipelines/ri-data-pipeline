12 share of the administrative costs and expenses of the program; (2) to pay the principal of, the
13 premium, if any, and the interest on outstanding bonds or notes of the corporation issued in respect
14 of the program to the extent that other revenues of the corporation pledged for the payment of the
15 bonds or notes are insufficient to pay the bonds or notes as they become due and payable; (3) to
16 create and maintain reserves which may, but need not be, required or provided for in the bond
17 resolution relating to the bonds or notes of the corporation; and (4) to establish and maintain
18 whatever education loan servicing, control, or audit procedures are deemed necessary to the

28 interest is created or by which the corporation’s interest in revenues is assigned need be filed in any
29 public records in order to perfect the security interest or lien against third parties, except in the
30 records of the corporation. The use and disposition of monies to the credit of a sinking or other
31 similar fund are subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or
32 notes or of the trust agreement. Except as provided in the resolution, or the trust agreement, the
33 sinking or other similar fund shall be a fund for all revenue bonds or notes issued to finance an
34 educational program or programs at one or more participating institutions for higher education
LC002292/SUB A - Page 19 of 23

14 whatsoever which may be undertaken by the corporation, and none of the bonds or notes of the
15 corporation nor any of its agreements or obligations, except for state reimbursement related to
16 school housing project financing, are construed to constitute an indebtedness of the state within the
17 meaning of any constitutional or statutory provision whatsoever, nor shall the issuance of bonds or
18 notes, under the provisions of this chapter, directly or indirectly or contingently obligate the state
19 or any municipality or political subdivision of the state to levy or to pledge any form of taxation

27 statement on the face of the bonds shall also include an exception for state reimbursement.
28 (b) Nothing contained in this section shall prevent nor be construed to prevent the
