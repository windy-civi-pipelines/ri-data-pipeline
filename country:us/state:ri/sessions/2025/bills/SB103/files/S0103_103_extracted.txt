It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Sections 27-18-30 and 27-18-52 of the General Laws in Chapter 27-18
2 entitled "Accident and Sickness Insurance Policies" are hereby amended to read as follows:
3 27-18-30. Health insurance contracts — Infertility.
4 (a) Any health insurance contract, plan, or policy delivered or issued for delivery or
5 renewed in this state, except contracts providing supplemental coverage to Medicare or other
6 governmental programs, that includes pregnancy-related benefits, shall provide coverage for
7 medically necessary expenses of diagnosis and treatment of infertility for women between the ages
8 of twenty-five (25) and forty-two (42) years, including preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) in
9 conjunction with in vitro fertilization (IVF), and for standard fertility-preservation services when a
10 medically necessary medical treatment may directly or indirectly cause iatrogenic infertility to a
11 covered person. To the extent that a health insurance contract provides reimbursement for a test or
12 procedure used in the diagnosis or treatment of conditions other than infertility, the tests and
13 procedures shall not be excluded from reimbursement when provided attendant to the diagnosis
14 and treatment of infertility for women between the ages of twenty-five (25) and forty-two (42)
15 years; provided, that a subscriber co-payment not to exceed twenty percent (20%) may be required
16 for those programs and/or procedures the sole purpose of which is the treatment of infertility.
17 (b) For purposes of this section, “infertility” means the condition of an otherwise
18 presumably healthy individual who is unable to conceive or sustain a pregnancy during a period of
19 one year.
1 (c) For purposes of this section, “standard fertility-preservation services” means
2 procedures consistent with established medical practices and professional guidelines published by
3 the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or
4 other reputable professional medical organizations.
5 (d) For purposes of this section, “iatrogenic infertility” means an impairment of fertility by
6 surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or other medical treatment affecting reproductive organs or
7 processes.
8 (e) For purposes of this section, “may directly or indirectly cause” means treatment with a
9 likely side effect of infertility as established by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine,
10 the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or other reputable professional organizations.
11 (f) Notwithstanding the provisions of § 27-18-19 or any other provision to the contrary,
12 this section shall apply to blanket or group policies of insurance.
13 (g) The health insurance contract may limit coverage to a lifetime cap of one hundred
14 thousand dollars ($100,000).
15 (h) For purposes of this section, "preimplantation genetic diagnosis" or "PGD" means a
16 technique used in conjunction with in vitro fertilization (IVF) to test embryos for specific genetic
17 disorders prior to their transfer to the uterus.
18 27-18-52. Genetic testing.
19 (a) Except as provided in chapter 37.3 of title 5, insurance administrators, health plans and
20 providers shall be prohibited from releasing genetic information without prior written authorization
21 of the individual. Written authorization shall be required for each disclosure and include to whom
22 the disclosure is being made. An exception shall exist for those participating in research settings
23 governed by the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Research Subjects (also known as
24 “The Common Rule”). Tests conducted purely for research are excluded from the definition, as are
25 tests for somatic (as opposed to heritable) mutations, and testing for forensic purposes.
26 (b) No individual or group health insurance contract, plan, or policy delivered, issued for
27 delivery, or renewed in this state which provides health insurance medical coverage that includes
28 coverage for physician services in a physician’s office, and every policy which provides major
29 medical or similar comprehensive-type coverage excluding disability income, long term care and
30 insurance supplemental policies which only provide coverage for specified diseases or other
31 supplemental policies, shall:
32 (1) Use a genetic test or request for genetic tests or the results of a genetic test to reject,
33 deny, limit, cancel, refuse to renew, increase the rates of, affect the terms or conditions of, or affect
34 a group or an individual health insurance policy, contract, or plan;
LC000272 - Page 2 of 12
1 (2) Request or require a genetic test for the purpose of determining whether or not to issue
2 or renew an individual’s health benefits coverage, to set reimbursement/co-pay levels or determine
3 covered benefits and services;
4 (3) Release the results of a genetic test without the prior written authorization of the
5 individual from whom the test was obtained, except in a format whereby individual identifiers are
6 removed, encrypted, or encoded so that the identity of the individual is not disclosed. A recipient
7 of information pursuant to this section may use or disclose this information solely to carry out the
8 purpose for which the information was disclosed. Authorization shall be required for each
9 redisclosure; an exception shall exist for participating in research settings governed by the Federal
10 Policy for the Protection of Human Research Subjects (also known as “The Common Rule”).
11 (4) Request or require information as to whether an individual has ever had a genetic test,
12 or participated in genetic testing of any kind, whether for clinical or research purposes.
13 (c) For the purposes of this section, “genetic testing” is the analysis of an individual’s DNA,
14 RNA, chromosomes, proteins and certain metabolites in order to detect heritable disease-related
15 genotypes, mutations, phenotypes or karyotypes for clinical purposes. Those purposes include
16 predicting risk of disease, identifying carriers, establishing prenatal and clinical diagnosis or
17 prognosis. Prenatal, newborn and carrier screening, as well as testing in high risk families may be
18 included provided there is an approved release by a parent or guardian. Tests for metabolites are
19 covered only when they are undertaken with high probability that an excess of deficiency of the
20 metabolite indicates the presence of heritable mutations in single genes. “Genetic testing” does not
21 mean routine physical measurement, a routine chemical, blood, or urine analysis or a test for drugs
22 or for HIV infections.
23 (d) Any health insurance contract, plan, or policy delivered or issued for delivery or
24 renewed in this state, except contracts providing supplemental coverage to Medicare or other
25 governmental programs, that includes pregnancy-related benefits, shall provide coverage for the
26 expenses of diagnosis and treatment of infertility for women between the ages of twenty-five (25)
27 and forty-two (42) years, including preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) in conjunction with
28 in vitro fertilization (IVF). For purposes of this section:
29 (1) "Preimplantation genetic diagnosis" or "PGD" means a technique used in conjunction
30 with in vitro fertilization (IVF) to test embryos for specific genetic disorders prior to their transfer
31 to the uterus;

Referred To: Senate Health & Human Services
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Sections 27-18-30 and 27-18-52 of the General Laws in Chapter 27-18
2 entitled "Accident and Sickness Insurance Policies" are hereby amended to read as follows:
3 27-18-30. Health insurance contracts — Infertility.
4 (a) Any health insurance contract, plan, or policy delivered or issued for delivery or
5 renewed in this state, except contracts providing supplemental coverage to Medicare or other
6 governmental programs, that includes pregnancy-related benefits, shall provide coverage for
7 medically necessary expenses of diagnosis and treatment of infertility for women between the ages
8 of twenty-five (25) and forty-two (42) years, including preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) in
9 conjunction with in vitro fertilization (IVF), and for standard fertility-preservation services when a
10 medically necessary medical treatment may directly or indirectly cause iatrogenic infertility to a
11 covered person. To the extent that a health insurance contract provides reimbursement for a test or
12 procedure used in the diagnosis or treatment of conditions other than infertility, the tests and
13 procedures shall not be excluded from reimbursement when provided attendant to the diagnosis
14 and treatment of infertility for women between the ages of twenty-five (25) and forty-two (42)
15 years; provided, that a subscriber co-payment not to exceed twenty percent (20%) may be required
16 for those programs and/or procedures the sole purpose of which is the treatment of infertility.
17 (b) For purposes of this section, “infertility” means the condition of an otherwise
18 presumably healthy individual who is unable to conceive or sustain a pregnancy during a period of
19 one year.

1 (c) For purposes of this section, “standard fertility-preservation services” means
2 procedures consistent with established medical practices and professional guidelines published by
3 the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or
4 other reputable professional medical organizations.
5 (d) For purposes of this section, “iatrogenic infertility” means an impairment of fertility by
6 surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or other medical treatment affecting reproductive organs or
7 processes.
8 (e) For purposes of this section, “may directly or indirectly cause” means treatment with a
9 likely side effect of infertility as established by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine,
10 the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or other reputable professional organizations.
11 (f) Notwithstanding the provisions of § 27-18-19 or any other provision to the contrary,
12 this section shall apply to blanket or group policies of insurance.
13 (g) The health insurance contract may limit coverage to a lifetime cap of one hundred
14 thousand dollars ($100,000).
15 (h) For purposes of this section, "preimplantation genetic diagnosis" or "PGD" means a
16 technique used in conjunction with in vitro fertilization (IVF) to test embryos for specific genetic
17 disorders prior to their transfer to the uterus.
18 27-18-52. Genetic testing.
19 (a) Except as provided in chapter 37.3 of title 5, insurance administrators, health plans and
20 providers shall be prohibited from releasing genetic information without prior written authorization
21 of the individual. Written authorization shall be required for each disclosure and include to whom
22 the disclosure is being made. An exception shall exist for those participating in research settings
23 governed by the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Research Subjects (also known as
24 “The Common Rule”). Tests conducted purely for research are excluded from the definition, as are
25 tests for somatic (as opposed to heritable) mutations, and testing for forensic purposes.
26 (b) No individual or group health insurance contract, plan, or policy delivered, issued for
27 delivery, or renewed in this state which provides health insurance medical coverage that includes
28 coverage for physician services in a physician’s office, and every policy which provides major
29 medical or similar comprehensive-type coverage excluding disability income, long term care and
30 insurance supplemental policies which only provide coverage for specified diseases or other
31 supplemental policies, shall:
32 (1) Use a genetic test or request for genetic tests or the results of a genetic test to reject,
33 deny, limit, cancel, refuse to renew, increase the rates of, affect the terms or conditions of, or affect
34 a group or an individual health insurance policy, contract, or plan;
LC000272 - Page 2 of 12

1 (2) Request or require a genetic test for the purpose of determining whether or not to issue
2 or renew an individual’s health benefits coverage, to set reimbursement/co-pay levels or determine
3 covered benefits and services;
4 (3) Release the results of a genetic test without the prior written authorization of the
5 individual from whom the test was obtained, except in a format whereby individual identifiers are
6 removed, encrypted, or encoded so that the identity of the individual is not disclosed. A recipient
7 of information pursuant to this section may use or disclose this information solely to carry out the
8 purpose for which the information was disclosed. Authorization shall be required for each
9 redisclosure; an exception shall exist for participating in research settings governed by the Federal
10 Policy for the Protection of Human Research Subjects (also known as “The Common Rule”).
11 (4) Request or require information as to whether an individual has ever had a genetic test,
12 or participated in genetic testing of any kind, whether for clinical or research purposes.
13 (c) For the purposes of this section, “genetic testing” is the analysis of an individual’s DNA,
14 RNA, chromosomes, proteins and certain metabolites in order to detect heritable disease-related
15 genotypes, mutations, phenotypes or karyotypes for clinical purposes. Those purposes include
16 predicting risk of disease, identifying carriers, establishing prenatal and clinical diagnosis or
17 prognosis. Prenatal, newborn and carrier screening, as well as testing in high risk families may be
18 included provided there is an approved release by a parent or guardian. Tests for metabolites are
19 covered only when they are undertaken with high probability that an excess of deficiency of the
20 metabolite indicates the presence of heritable mutations in single genes. “Genetic testing” does not
21 mean routine physical measurement, a routine chemical, blood, or urine analysis or a test for drugs
22 or for HIV infections.
23 (d) Any health insurance contract, plan, or policy delivered or issued for delivery or
24 renewed in this state, except contracts providing supplemental coverage to Medicare or other
25 governmental programs, that includes pregnancy-related benefits, shall provide coverage for the
26 expenses of diagnosis and treatment of infertility for women between the ages of twenty-five (25)
27 and forty-two (42) years, including preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) in conjunction with
28 in vitro fertilization (IVF). For purposes of this section:
29 (1) "Preimplantation genetic diagnosis" or "PGD" means a technique used in conjunction
30 with in vitro fertilization (IVF) to test embryos for specific genetic disorders prior to their transfer
31 to the uterus;
