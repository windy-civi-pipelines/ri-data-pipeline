EDUCATION MODULES FOR DIVORCING PARENTS
Introduced By: Senators Appollonio, Burke, and Vargas
Date Introduced: February 21, 2025
Referred To: Senate Judiciary
1 WHEREAS, Research conclusively shows that the failure of divorced parents to co-
2 parent, cooperate, and communicate constructively for the benefit of their minor children has
3 harmful effects on both the parents and their children; and
4 WHEREAS, These harmful effects can include anxiety, depression, social withdrawal,
5 impaired school attendance and academic performance, reduced work productivity, substance
6 abuse, and self-harm, all of which impact public health and draw on social services and medical
7 services; and
8 WHEREAS, Effective co-parenting, communication, and collaboration between divorced
9 parents has been shown to reduce the risk of the above-stated harmful effects; and

15 to: online modules; prerecorded video modules; and in-person classes, seminars, and/or
16 workshops);

19 parents including, judgments of module efficacy for divorcing couples exhibiting low, medium,
20 and high levels of conflict;
21 Recommendations on any available supplemental programming or educational modules
