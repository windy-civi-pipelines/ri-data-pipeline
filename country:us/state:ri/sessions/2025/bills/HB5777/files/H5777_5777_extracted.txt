10 SECTION 3. Chapter 42-13.1 of the General Laws entitled "The Rhode Island Bridge
11 Replacement, Reconstruction, and Maintenance Fund" is hereby repealed in its entirety.
12 CHAPTER 42-13.1
13 The Rhode Island Bridge Replacement, Reconstruction, and Maintenance Fund
14 42-13.1-1. Short title.
15 This chapter shall be known and may be cited as “The Rhode Island Bridge Replacement,
16 Reconstruction, and Maintenance Fund Act of 2016.”
17 42-13.1-2. Legislative findings.
18 The general assembly finds that:
19 (1) The state of Rhode Island, through the Rhode Island department of transportation (“the
20 department”), funds the reconstruction, replacement, and maintenance of all bridges in Rhode
21 Island, except the Newport Bridge, the Mount Hope Bridge, the Jamestown-Verrazano Bridge, and
22 the Sakonnet River Bridge.
23 (2) According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) 2015 National Bridge
24 Inventory (NBI) data, there are seven hundred sixty-four (764) bridges in Rhode Island greater than
25 twenty feet (20′) in length. Of these NBI bridges, one hundred seventy-seven (177) bridges, or
26 twenty-three percent (23%), are classified as structurally deficient.
27 (3) For the past several decades, Rhode Island has depended on three (3) primary sources
28 for funding all transportation infrastructure construction, maintenance, and operations: federal
29 funds, state bond funds, and motor fuel tax revenue. Of these sources, two (2), federal funds and
30 motor fuel tax revenue, are mutable.
31 (4) The 2008 governor’s blue ribbon panel on transportation funding, the 2011 senate
32 special commission on sustainable transportation funding, and the 2013 special legislative
33 commission to study the funding for East Bay bridges determined that there is insufficient revenue
34 available from all existing sources to fund the maintenance and improvement of Rhode Island
LC001044 - Page 7 of 15
1 transportation infrastructure.
2 (5) In 2011, the general assembly adopted a component of the recommended systemic
3 change to transportation funding by dedicating increased resources from the Rhode Island capital
4 plan fund and creating the Rhode Island highway maintenance account, to be funded by an increase
5 in license and registration fees, beginning in FY2014.
6 (6) In 2014, the general assembly adopted changes to the Rhode Island highway
7 maintenance account to provide additional state revenue for transportation infrastructure in future
8 years.
9 (7) Although the state is shifting from long-term borrowing to reliance upon annual
10 revenues to fund transportation infrastructure on a pay-as-you go basis, and although a recurring
11 state source of capital funds has been established, there is still a funding gap between the revenue
12 needed to maintain all bridges in structurally sound and good condition and the annual amounts
13 generated by current dedicated revenue sources.
14 (8) According to the U.S. General Accounting Office, just one, fully-loaded five-axle (5)
15 tractor trailer has the same impact on the interstate as nine thousand six hundred (9,600)
16 automobiles. The department estimates that tractor trailers cause in excess of seventy percent (70%)
17 of the damage to the state’s transportation infrastructure, including Rhode Island bridges, on an
18 annual basis. However, revenue contributions attributable to tractor trailers account for less than
19 twenty percent (20%) of the state’s total annual revenues to fund transportation infrastructure.
20 (9) The United States Congress, consistent with its power to regulate interstate commerce
21 and pursuant to 23 U.S.C. § 129, has authorized states to implement reconstruction or replacement
22 of a toll-free bridge and conversion of the bridge to a toll facility, provided that the state:
23 (i) Has in effect a law that permits tolling on a bridge prior to commencing any such
24 activity; and
25 (ii) Otherwise complies with the requirements of 23 U.S.C. § 129.
26 42-13.1-3. Definitions.
27 As used in this chapter, the following words and terms shall have the following meanings,
28 unless the context shall indicate another or different meaning:
29 (1) “Availability payment” means a payment by the department under a contract for a toll
30 facility or any other facility that is based on the availability of the facility at a specified performance
31 level and may include, without limitation, compensation for operations, maintenance, and financing
32 of the facility.
33 (2) “Department” means the department of transportation, or, if the department shall be
34 abolished, the board, body, or commission succeeding to the principal functions thereof or upon
LC001044 - Page 8 of 15
1 whom the powers given by chapter 5 of title 37 to the department shall be given by law.
2 (3) “Large commercial truck” shall be defined pursuant to the Federal Highway
3 Administration (FHWA) vehicle classification schedule as any vehicle within Class 8 - single
4 trailer, three (3) or four (4) axles, up to and including Class 13 - seven (7) or more axle multi-trailer
5 trucks, as such classifications may be revised from time to time by the FHWA.
6 (4) “Other vehicle” means any vehicle that has not been defined pursuant to this chapter as
7 a large commercial truck.
8 (5) “Passenger vehicle” shall be defined pursuant to the Federal Highway Administration
9 (FHWA) vehicle classification schedule as any vehicle within Class 1, 2, and 3 as such

11 (6) “Radio frequency identification transponder” or “RFID” means a toll collection system
12 approved by the department that may consist of a toll tag placed inside the vehicle and an overhead
13 antenna that reads the toll tag and collects the toll.

15 commercial truck that passes through any electronic tolling location as authorized pursuant to § 42-
16 13.1-4 and who does not pay the required toll and/or fees, fines, or penalties within the maximum
17 allowable period specified under § 42-13.1-11.
18 (8) “Toll facility” means equipment or capital improvements funded in whole or in part by
19 toll revenue, or required to effectuate toll collection.
20 (9) “Turnpike and bridge authority” means the Rhode Island turnpike and bridge authority
21 (RITBA), a public instrumentality of the state of Rhode Island, created by the general assembly
22 pursuant to chapter 12 of title 24.
23 42-13.1-4. Authority to collect tolls on large commercial trucks only.
24 (a) The department is hereby authorized to fix, revise, charge, and collect tolls for the
25 privilege of traveling on Rhode Island bridges to provide for replacement, reconstruction,

27 cost-benefit analysis and providing an opportunity for public comment. The tolls shall be collected
28 on large commercial trucks only and shall not be collected on any other vehicle; provided, however,
29 no vehicle shall be tolled other than a tractor or truck tractor as defined in 23 C.F.R. 658.5, pulling

31 effect until it has been approved by the majority of those electors voting in a statewide referendum.
32 The secretary of state shall certify the results of the statewide referendum. Tolls on large
33 commercial trucks may be implemented utilizing all-electric toll collection methodologies on a

2 and maintenance of Rhode Island’s system of bridges.
3 42-13.1-8. Amount of tolls.
4 The department’s authority to fix and adjust the amount of tolls shall be determined by the
5 costs of replacement, reconstruction, maintenance, and operation of Rhode Island’s system of
6 bridges and/or any portion or portions thereof, including costs associated with the acquisition,
7 construction, operation, and maintenance of the toll facilities and administrative costs in connection
8 therewith.

10 SECTION 3. Chapter 42-13.1 of the General Laws entitled "The Rhode Island Bridge
11 Replacement, Reconstruction, and Maintenance Fund" is hereby repealed in its entirety.
12 CHAPTER 42-13.1
13 The Rhode Island Bridge Replacement, Reconstruction, and Maintenance Fund
14 42-13.1-1. Short title.
15 This chapter shall be known and may be cited as “The Rhode Island Bridge Replacement,
16 Reconstruction, and Maintenance Fund Act of 2016.”
17 42-13.1-2. Legislative findings.
18 The general assembly finds that:
19 (1) The state of Rhode Island, through the Rhode Island department of transportation (“the
20 department”), funds the reconstruction, replacement, and maintenance of all bridges in Rhode
21 Island, except the Newport Bridge, the Mount Hope Bridge, the Jamestown-Verrazano Bridge, and
22 the Sakonnet River Bridge.
23 (2) According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) 2015 National Bridge
24 Inventory (NBI) data, there are seven hundred sixty-four (764) bridges in Rhode Island greater than
25 twenty feet (20′) in length. Of these NBI bridges, one hundred seventy-seven (177) bridges, or
26 twenty-three percent (23%), are classified as structurally deficient.
27 (3) For the past several decades, Rhode Island has depended on three (3) primary sources
28 for funding all transportation infrastructure construction, maintenance, and operations: federal
29 funds, state bond funds, and motor fuel tax revenue. Of these sources, two (2), federal funds and
30 motor fuel tax revenue, are mutable.
31 (4) The 2008 governor’s blue ribbon panel on transportation funding, the 2011 senate
32 special commission on sustainable transportation funding, and the 2013 special legislative
33 commission to study the funding for East Bay bridges determined that there is insufficient revenue
34 available from all existing sources to fund the maintenance and improvement of Rhode Island
LC001044 - Page 7 of 15

1 transportation infrastructure.
2 (5) In 2011, the general assembly adopted a component of the recommended systemic
3 change to transportation funding by dedicating increased resources from the Rhode Island capital
4 plan fund and creating the Rhode Island highway maintenance account, to be funded by an increase
5 in license and registration fees, beginning in FY2014.
6 (6) In 2014, the general assembly adopted changes to the Rhode Island highway
7 maintenance account to provide additional state revenue for transportation infrastructure in future
8 years.
9 (7) Although the state is shifting from long-term borrowing to reliance upon annual
10 revenues to fund transportation infrastructure on a pay-as-you go basis, and although a recurring
11 state source of capital funds has been established, there is still a funding gap between the revenue
12 needed to maintain all bridges in structurally sound and good condition and the annual amounts
13 generated by current dedicated revenue sources.
14 (8) According to the U.S. General Accounting Office, just one, fully-loaded five-axle (5)
15 tractor trailer has the same impact on the interstate as nine thousand six hundred (9,600)
16 automobiles. The department estimates that tractor trailers cause in excess of seventy percent (70%)
17 of the damage to the state’s transportation infrastructure, including Rhode Island bridges, on an
18 annual basis. However, revenue contributions attributable to tractor trailers account for less than
19 twenty percent (20%) of the state’s total annual revenues to fund transportation infrastructure.
20 (9) The United States Congress, consistent with its power to regulate interstate commerce
21 and pursuant to 23 U.S.C. § 129, has authorized states to implement reconstruction or replacement
22 of a toll-free bridge and conversion of the bridge to a toll facility, provided that the state:
23 (i) Has in effect a law that permits tolling on a bridge prior to commencing any such
24 activity; and
25 (ii) Otherwise complies with the requirements of 23 U.S.C. § 129.
