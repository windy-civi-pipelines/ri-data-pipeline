Introduced By: Representatives Giraldo, Shekarchi, Blazejewski, Chippendale, Cruz,
Potter, Stewart, Alzate, Solomon, and Casimiro
Date Introduced: May 08, 2025
Referred To: House read and passed
1 WHEREAS, The early childhood years are the most active period for the developing
2 brain and a stable, secure relationship with a nurturing, caring adult is a key factor in the
3 development of young children; and
4 WHEREAS, Many parents begin the difficult lifetime job of raising a child feeling
5 unprepared for the challenges ahead and children have a better, healthier start when parents have
6 the support and skills needed to raise them; and
7 WHEREAS, Home visiting can include a variety of different programs and models,
8 including early childhood home visiting programs and parenting education programs; and
9 WHEREAS, Home visiting programs are completely voluntary and help parents meet the
10 unique needs of their children, promote healthy development, strengthen family relationships,
11 reduce the risk of abuse and neglect, and promote equity by providing resources to families who
12 are furthest from opportunity; and
13 WHEREAS, Well-trained professionals implement early childhood home visitation so
14 that all families have the opportunity to access information in ways that respect their unique
15 beliefs, traditions and customs; and
16 WHEREAS, For at least four decades, Rhode Island’s First Connections program,
17 overseen by the Department of Health, has been providing free, voluntary, statewide home
18 visiting to expectant mothers and families with newborns, infants, and toddlers, reaching about
19 thirty-five percent of families with new babies; and
20 WHEREAS, In 2010, Rhode Island expanded home visiting services to fund

1 implementation of Healthy Families America and Parents as Teachers as nationally-recognized
2 evidence-based program models that connect pregnant and parenting families with a designated
3 support person who guides them through the early stages of raising a family; now, therefore be it
4 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
5 commemorates May 8th of 2025, to be “Rhode Island Home Visiting Day” in the State of Rhode
6 Island, and urges individuals and organizations across our State to utilize home visiting resources
7 as needed to support the health and well-being of our children and families; and be it further
8 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
9 transmit duly certified copies of this resolution to Jerome Larkin, MD, Director of the Rhode
10 Island Department of Health, and Kim Merolla-Brito, Director of the Rhode Island Department of
11 Human Services.
