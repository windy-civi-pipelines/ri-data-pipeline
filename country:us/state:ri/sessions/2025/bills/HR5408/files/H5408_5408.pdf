1 WHEREAS, In 1961, the University of Rhode Island initiated a Master of Public
2 Administration program. Twenty years later, the program’s faculty aspired to become an

6 Aaron Ley, Ph.D.; and
7 WHEREAS, In preparation for a career in education, Dr. Ley attained his Bachelor’s

16 WHEREAS, In 2025, the University of Rhode Island Master of Public Administration

18 MPA program in Rhode Island to receive accreditation from NASPAA; and

1 WHEREAS, NASPAA is the “global standard in public service master’s degree

10 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
