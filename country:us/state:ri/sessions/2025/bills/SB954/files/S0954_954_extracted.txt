6 one-hundredths of one percent (.08%) or more by weight, as shown by a chemical analysis of a

8 preclude a conviction based on other admissible evidence, including the testimony of a drug
9 recognition expert or evaluator, certified pursuant to training approved by the Rhode Island
10 department of transportation office on highway safety. Proof of guilt under this section may also
11 be based on evidence that the person charged was under the influence of intoxicating liquor, drugs,

13 to a degree that rendered the person incapable of safely operating a vehicle. The fact that any person

16 (2) [Deleted by P.L. 2021, ch. 170, § 1 and P.L. 2021, ch. 171, § 1.]
17 (c) In any criminal prosecution for a violation of subsection (a), evidence as to the amount

22 been complied with:
23 (1) The defendant has consented to the taking of the test upon which the analysis is made.
24 Evidence that the defendant had refused to submit to the test shall not be admissible unless the

8 the person of this right and afforded him or her a reasonable opportunity to exercise this right, and

4 All licenses issued shall be in any form prescribed by the department of business regulation

10 by the department and the modification or repeal of any rules and regulations previously adopted

1 section.
2 (b) All fees or fines paid for licenses or violations under this chapter shall be subject to a
3 surcharge equal to ten percent (10%) of the cost of the fee or fine, which shall be deposited into a

11 SECTION 4. Chapter 3-7 of the General Laws entitled "Retail Licenses" is hereby amended
12 by adding thereto the following sections:
13 3-7-30. SafeRIde program.
14 (a) The primary legislative purpose of this section is to prevent intoxication-related injuries
15 and deaths, to reduce the prevalence of DUIs among Rhode Island’s population, and to encourage
16 all servers of alcohol to exercise responsible serving practices.
17 (b) The SafeRIde program will provide transportation, free of charge, to persons suspected
18 of having a prohibited alcohol concentration, as defined in § 31-27-2, from any premises licensed

34 31-27-2. Driving under influence of liquor or drugs. [Effective July 1, 2025.]
LC002204 - Page 2 of 12

1 (a) Whoever drives or otherwise operates any vehicle in the state while under the influence
2 of any intoxicating liquor, drugs, toluene, or any controlled substance as defined in chapter 28 of
3 title 21, or any combination of these, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, except as provided in
4 subsection (d)(3), and shall be punished as provided in subsection (d) of this section.
5 (b)(1) Any person charged under subsection (a), whose blood alcohol concentration is eight
6 one-hundredths of one percent (.08%) or more by weight, as shown by a chemical analysis of a
7 blood, breath, or urine sample, shall be guilty of violating subsection (a). This provision shall not
8 preclude a conviction based on other admissible evidence, including the testimony of a drug
9 recognition expert or evaluator, certified pursuant to training approved by the Rhode Island
10 department of transportation office on highway safety. Proof of guilt under this section may also
11 be based on evidence that the person charged was under the influence of intoxicating liquor, drugs,
12 toluene, or any controlled substance defined in chapter 28 of title 21, or any combination of these,
13 to a degree that rendered the person incapable of safely operating a vehicle. The fact that any person
14 charged with violating this section is, or has been, legally entitled to use alcohol or a drug shall not
15 constitute a defense against any charge of violating this section.
16 (2) [Deleted by P.L. 2021, ch. 170, § 1 and P.L. 2021, ch. 171, § 1.]
17 (c) In any criminal prosecution for a violation of subsection (a), evidence as to the amount
18 of intoxicating liquor, toluene, or any controlled substance as defined in chapter 28 of title 21, or
19 any combination of these, in the defendant’s blood at the time alleged as shown by a chemical
20 analysis of the defendant’s breath, blood, saliva or urine or other bodily substance, shall be
21 admissible and competent, provided that evidence is presented that the following conditions have
22 been complied with:
23 (1) The defendant has consented to the taking of the test upon which the analysis is made.
24 Evidence that the defendant had refused to submit to the test shall not be admissible unless the
25 defendant elects to testify.
26 (2) A true copy of the report of the test result was hand delivered at the location of the test
27 or mailed within seventy-two (72) hours of the taking of the test to the person submitting to a breath
28 test.
29 (3) Any person submitting to a chemical test of blood, urine, saliva or other body fluids
30 shall have a true copy of the report of the test result mailed to him or her within thirty (30) days
31 following the taking of the test.
32 (4) The test was performed according to methods and with equipment approved by the
33 director of the department of health of the state of Rhode Island and by an authorized individual.
34 (5) Equipment used for the conduct of the tests by means of breath analysis had been tested
LC002204 - Page 3 of 12

1 for accuracy within thirty (30) days preceding the test by personnel qualified as hereinbefore
2 provided, and breathalyzer operators shall be qualified and certified by the department of health
3 within three hundred sixty-five (365) days of the test.
4 (6) The person arrested and charged with operating a motor vehicle while under the
5 influence of intoxicating liquor, toluene, or any controlled substance as defined in chapter 28 of
6 title 21 or any combination of these in violation of subsection (a), was afforded the opportunity to
7 have an additional chemical test. The officer arresting or so charging the person shall have informed
8 the person of this right and afforded him or her a reasonable opportunity to exercise this right, and
9 a notation to this effect is made in the official records of the case in the police department. Refusal
10 to permit an additional chemical test shall render incompetent and inadmissible in evidence the
11 original report.
12 (d)(1)(i) Every person found to have violated subsection (b)(1) shall be sentenced as
13 follows: for a first violation whose blood alcohol concentration is eight one-hundredths of one
14 percent (.08%), but less than one-tenth of one percent (.1%), by weight, or who has a blood presence

15 or other reliable indicia or articulable conditions thereof, but not intoxicating liquor based on a
16 preliminary breath test, results from a breathalyzer that indicates no blood alcohol concentration,

19 to operating a motor vehicle as provided in § 31-27-2.8.
20 (10) Notwithstanding any other sentencing and disposition provisions contained in this

5 disabilities and hospitals; provided, however, that the court may permit a servicemember or veteran
