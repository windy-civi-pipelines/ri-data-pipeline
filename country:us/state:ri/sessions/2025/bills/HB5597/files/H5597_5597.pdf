12 systems.
13 (4) "Mechanical ventilation system" means a building ventilation system provided by
14 mechanically powered, permanent equipment, such as motor-driven fans and blowers, and includes
15 carbon dioxide monitoring. The term does not include devices such as wind-driven turbine
16 ventilators, portable air cleaning and filtration devices and mechanically operated windows.
17 (5) “MERV” means minimum efficiency reporting value.
18 (6) “PM2.5” means particles less than two and one-half (2.5) micrometers in diameter.
19 (7) “PM10” means particles less than ten (10) micrometers in diameter.

1 (8) “Qualified adjusting personnel” means either of the following:
2 (i) A certified testing, adjusting, and balancing (TAB) technician; or
3 (ii) A skilled and trained workforce under the supervision of a certified TAB technician.
4 (9) "Qualified testing personnel” means a certified TAB technician or a person certified to
5 perform ventilation verification assessments of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems
6 through a certification body accredited under the ISO/IEC 17024 personnel certification standard.
7 (10) "Skilled and trained construction workforce” means a workforce, managed in
8 conformance with the Davis-Bacon Act, P.L. 71-798, 46 Stat.1494, 40 U.S.C. § 3141-3148, in

10 apprenticeship program registered with the department of labor and training (DLT), division of
11 apprenticeship training.
12 (11) “Verification” means the process of evaluating a system, component, or product to
13 determine whether it complies with specified requirements, design specifications, or regulations.
14 (b) The department of health shall establish by regulation recommended standards for
15 indoor air quality in schools, including recommended thresholds and/or rates for the following:
16 (1) Temperature;
17 (2) Humidity;
18 (3) Carbon dioxide;
19 (4) PM2.5;
20 (5) PM10;
21 (6) Ventilation; and
22 (7) Filtration.
23 (c) The department of education shall establish a program to undertake a uniform
24 inspection and evaluation of the indoor air quality within each school building, including heating,
25 ventilation and air conditioning systems when present. The program shall be conducted in
26 conjunction with the local school boards. Any deficiencies from the department of health
27 recommendations established pursuant to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section shall be
28 included with the estimated cost of remediation in the capital construction, reconstruction,
29 maintenance, and other capital needs for schools, as outlined in §16-105-3. The inspection and
30 evaluation shall be performed using a skilled and trained construction workforce at least once every
31 five (5) years. The assessment shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
32 (1) Measurements of temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, PM2.5, and PM10;
33 (2) Testing for maximum filter efficiency aiming for MERV 13 when feasible;
34 (3) Assessment of MERV filter level and replacement routine;
LC001436 - Page 2 of 4

1 (4) Measurements of outside air delivery rate;
2 (5) Verification of the condition and operation of ventilation components, pursuant to
3 specifications provided by the manufacturer;
4 (6) Verification of unit operation and that required maintenance has been performed;
5 (7) Verification of control sequences;
6 (8) Measurement of all air distribution inlets and outlets;
7 (9) Verification, replacement or installation of carbon dioxide sensors; and
8 (10) Collection of field data for the installation of mechanical ventilation system or HVAC
9 system if none exists.
10 (d) The department of education shall make the inspection and evaluation results easily
11 available online and send the test results directly to:
12 (1) Each school's principal;
13 (2) The department of elementary and secondary education; and
14 (3) The appropriate local school board.
15 (e) All schools with HVAC systems shall install filtration that achieves MERV levels of
16 thirteen (13) to the extent determined to be feasible and appropriate for the existing HVAC system,
17 as determined by the school board, in accordance with ASHRAE Standard 62.1- 2022 § 8 and Table
18 8–1. If it is determined by the school board that the existing HVAC system is not designed to
19 achieve MERV levels of thirteen (13), the school shall install filtration that achieves the highest
20 MERV level feasible without significantly reducing the lifespan or performance of the existing
21 HVAC system. School personnel shall inspect and replace filters as recommended by manufacturer
22 guidelines. All HVAC repairs, upgrades, or replacements shall be performed by a skilled and
