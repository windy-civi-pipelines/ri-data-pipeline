BUDGET EQUITY IMPACT ACT
Introduced By: Representatives Morales, Felix, and Batista
Date Introduced: April 30, 2025
Referred To: House State Government & Elections
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Legislative findings and purpose.
2 (1) Persistent, widespread, and unacceptable disparities exist in Rhode Island for
3 individuals and families due to structural inequities and past discrimination. Such disparities
4 include the racial wealth gap, the gender pay gap, and incarceration policies that have
5 disproportionately impacted communities of color.
6 (2) Rhode Island has already enacted legislation prohibiting discrimination based on race,
7 color, ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, disability, age, or
8 country of ancestral origin, including in employment and housing matters.
9 (3) Discrimination and inequities based on these classifications is inconsistent with the
10 protections outlined in the State constitution and Rhode Island legislation. These inequities affect
11 the quality of life, access to services, access to safe and affordable housing, and access to capital,
12 as well as educational and economic attainment for some Rhode Island populations differently than
13 for others.
14 (4) For the most part, legislation in Rhode Island has been implemented without attention
15 to disparities and equity. Some of this legislation has had disparate impacts on some of our
16 communities. Because some legislation might have unanticipated negative impacts, it is important
17 that legislators, when hearing and considering proposed legislation, have tools to understand the
18 likely effects of such legislation on existing disparities.
1 (5) Equity Impact Statements can serve as a tool to inform legislators of potential
2 consequences of policies that may have a disproportionate impact on historically disadvantaged
3 populations prior to enacting new legislation, thus assuring that the general assembly takes each
4 opportunity available to increase equity and decrease disparities.
5 (6) Beginning in 2007, some states, including Connecticut and Massachusetts, began
6 implementing racial impact statements to address racial disparities in their criminal justice systems.
7 In 2019, Maine created a permanent commission to address historic and pervasive racial inequity
8 in legislation. This act aims to build on that foundation here in Rhode Island, proposing the
9 inclusion of a new legislative tool, a broad Equity Impact Statement accounting for race, color,
10 ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, disability, age, or country
11 of ancestral origin.
12 (7) It is therefore the desire of the General Assembly to address the impacts of our
13 legislation moving forward, and to do so with attention to equity and the impact our legislation will
14 have on our diverse and varied communities. This chapter aims to add equity impact statements
15 into the legislative process to contribute to the development of sound and fair policies.
16 SECTION 2. Title 22 of the General Laws entitled "GENERAL ASSEMBLY" is hereby
17 amended by adding thereto the following chapter:
