3 56 years; and
4 WHEREAS, Mary Ann Edwards was born and raised in Newport, and was a part of the

10 40 years; and

19 regularly cruising with her late husband John Edwards III to Maine and the Bahamas on their
20 sailboat Airedale; and

1 WHEREAS, Mrs. Edwards was a devoted wife and mother who always put her loved
2 ones first in her life. Mary Ann Edwards leaves behind the Honorable John "Jay" Edwards IV and

9 Diane Harrington, as well as many nieces and nephews. In addition to her husband of 56 years,
10 John Edwards III, Mary Ann Tobin was also predeceased by her sister, Joan Reis, brothers John
11 and James Tobin, brothers-in-law George Reis and Jack Brown, and nephews Christopher Brown
12 and Patrick Tobin, as well as her parents, John Tobin and Mary Tobin and her stepmother, Mary
13 (Kennedy) Tobin. Mary Ann Tobin will also be sorely missed by Toby, her Portuguese water dog
