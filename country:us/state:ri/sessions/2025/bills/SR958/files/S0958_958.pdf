JOYOUSLY CELEBRATING THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF PACE-RI
Introduced By: Senator Valarie J. Lawson
Date Introduced: April 07, 2025
Referred To: Placed on the Senate Consent Calendar
1 WHEREAS, PACE-RI is a nonprofit healthcare plan for frail seniors that was founded in
2 2005, with the express purpose of assisting low-income seniors who desire to continue to live in
3 their homes instead of a nursing home. Originally founded in Providence, PACE-RI currently has
4 centers in East Providence, Newport, Westerly and Woonsocket; and
5 WHEREAS, PACE-RI serves as both a health insurer and healthcare provider, addressing
6 seniors’ health needs through a holistic approach, including primary and acute services,
7 pharmacy, behavioral health, rehabilitation services, home care, transportation, adult day services,
8 meals, and all other healthcare needs; and
9 WHEREAS, Thanks to the services provided by PACE-RI, 450 medically complex
10 participants were able to stay in their homes instead of going to nursing homes, for an average of
11 four additional years compared to those without PACE-RI. PACE-RI provides significant savings
12 for Rhode Island taxpayers and delivers the high-quality care and support most people desire in
13 their final years; and
14 WHEREAS, The average participant is 75 years old with six medical conditions and
15 eleven medications. Approximately eighty-nine percent of PACE-RI enrollees have a behavioral
16 health diagnosis and thirty-five percent have dementia. Almost all enrollees need help with
17 multiple activities of daily living activities such as daily bathing, grooming, feeding and dressing,
18 and are eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare; and
19 WHEREAS, PACE-RI has served more than 2,000 people in its distinguished twenty
20 years of service. PACE-RI participants experience eleven percent fewer emergency room visits

1 per 100 participants compared to their peers not in the PACE-RI program, and forty-three percent
2 of PACE-RI participants who have been enrolled for at least a year have not required inpatient
3 hospitalization. Thanks to PACE-RI, eighty-six percent of participants say they feel that PACE-
4 RI’s services help improve or maintain their independence and quality of life; now, therefore be it
5 RESOLVED, That this Senate of the State of Rhode Island hereby joyously celebrates the
6 20th Anniversary of PACE-RI, and thanks them for the high-quality healthcare services they
7 provide on a daily basis to the frail elderly enrollees under their care; and be it further
8 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
9 transmit a duly certified copy of this resolution to Mr. Thomas Boucher, Chief of External
10 Affairs, PACE-RI.
