9 Nonconformance is of only two (2) types:
10 (i) Nonconforming by use: a lawfully established use of land, building, or structure that is
11 not a permitted use in that zoning district. A building or structure containing more dwelling units
12 than are permitted by the use regulations of a zoning ordinance is nonconformity by use; or
13 nonconforming by use. Nonconforming by use shall be established if a use was lawfully existing
14 prior to the enactment of the zoning ordinance or amendment that rendered the use out of
15 conformity; if a use has been in existence for fifty (50) years; or if a non-accessory use has been in
16 existence for twenty-five (25) years without the initiation of any enforcement actions to ensure
17 conformity with the zoning ordinance. In the case where the nonconformance by use exists because
18 the number of dwelling units exceeds the limits established by the use regulations of a zoning
19 ordinance, the nonconformance shall be established if the dwelling units were lawfully existing
20 prior to the enactment of a zoning ordinance or a zoning amendment that rendered the use out of
21 conformity; if the dwelling units were in existence prior to January 1, 2018; if the dwelling units
22 have been in existence for twenty-five (25) years; or if the dwelling units have been in existence
23 for six (6) years without the initiation of any enforcement actions to ensure conformity with the
24 zoning ordinance. In the case where the use is a zoning use that raises pollution risk,
25 nonconformance by use shall only be established if the zoning use that raises pollution risk was
26 lawfully existing for at least six (6) years prior to the enactment of the zoning ordinance or
27 amendment that rendered the zoning use that raises pollution risk out of conformity.
28 (ii) Nonconforming by dimension: a building, structure, or parcel of land not in compliance
29 with the dimensional regulations of the zoning ordinance. Dimensional regulations include all
30 regulations of the zoning ordinance, other than those pertaining to the permitted uses. A building
31 or structure containing more dwelling units than are permitted by the use regulations of a zoning
32 ordinance is nonconforming by use; a building or structure containing a permitted number of
33 dwelling units by the use regulations of the zoning ordinance, but not meeting the lot area per
34 dwelling unit regulations, is nonconforming by dimension.
LC000266 - Page 10 of 29
1 Nonconformance by dimension shall be established if the dimensional conditions were
2 lawfully existing prior to the enactment of the zoning ordinance or amendment that rendered the
3 building, structure, or parcel of land out of conformity; if the dimensional conditions were in
4 existence prior to January 1, 2018; if the dimensional conditions have been in existence for twenty
5 five (25) years; or if the dimensional conditions have been in existence for six (6) years without the
6 initiation of any enforcement actions to ensure conformity with the zoning ordinance.

17 requirements for the coordination between contiguous communities, the state, and other agencies,
18 as required by chapter 22.2 of this title.
19 45-24-36. General provisions — Division into districts.
20 A zoning ordinance divides a city or town into zoning use and form districts, which may
21 include overlay districts and floating zone districts, of the number, kind, type, shape, and area
22 suitable to carry out the purposes of this chapter. Regulations and standards shall be consistent for
23 each land use, type of development and redevelopment, or type of building or structure within a
24 district, but may differ from those in other districts. Zoning use and form districts shall be depicted
25 by type and location on the zoning map.
26 45-24-37. General provisions — Permitted uses.
27 (a) The zoning ordinance shall provide a listing of all land uses and/or performance
28 standards for uses that are permitted within the zoning use and form districts of the municipality.
29 The ordinance may provide for a procedure under which a proposed land use that is not specifically
30 listed may be presented by the property owner to the zoning board of review or to a local official
31 or agency charged with administration and enforcement of the ordinance for an evaluation and
32 determination of whether the proposed use is of a similar type, character, and intensity as a listed
33 permitted use. Upon such determination, the proposed use may be considered to be a permitted use.
34 (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the following uses are permitted
LC000266 - Page 17 of 29
1 uses within all residential zoning use and form districts of a municipality and all industrial and
2 commercial zoning use and form districts except where residential use is prohibited for public
3 health or safety reasons:
4 (1) Households;
5 (2) Community residences; and
6 (3) Family daycare homes.
7 (c) Any time a building or other structure used for residential purposes, or a portion of a
8 building containing residential units, is rendered uninhabitable by virtue of a casualty such as fire
9 or flood, the owner of the property is allowed to park, temporarily, mobile and manufactured home,
10 or homes, as the need may be, elsewhere upon the land, for use and occupancy of the former
11 occupants for a period of up to twelve (12) months, or until the building or structure is rehabilitated
12 and otherwise made fit for occupancy. The property owner, or a properly designated agent of the
13 owner, is only allowed to cause the mobile and manufactured home, or homes, to remain
14 temporarily upon the land by making timely application to the local building official for the
15 purposes of obtaining the necessary permits to repair or rebuild redevelop the structure.
16 (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, appropriate access for people with
17 disabilities to residential structures is allowed as a reasonable accommodation for any person(s)
18 residing, or intending to reside, in the residential structure.
19 (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, an accessory dwelling unit
20 (“ADU”) that meets the requirements of §§ 45-24-31 and 45-24-73(a) shall be a permitted use in
21 all residential zoning districts. An ADU that meets the requirements of §§ 45-24-31 and 45-24-
22 73(a) shall be permitted through an administrative building permit process only.
23 (f) When used in this section the terms “people with disabilities” or “member, or members,
24 with disabilities” means a person(s) who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially
25 limits one or more major life activities, as defined in 42-87-1(5).
26 (g) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, plant agriculture is a permitted
27 use within all zoning districts of a municipality, including all industrial and commercial zoning
28 districts, except where prohibited for public health or safety reasons or the protection of wildlife
29 habitat.
30 (h) Adaptive reuse. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, adaptive reuse
31 for the conversion of any commercial building, including offices, schools, religious facilities,
32 medical buildings, and malls into residential units or mixed-use developments which include the
33 development of at least fifty percent (50%) of the existing gross floor area into residential units,
34 shall be a permitted use and allowed by specific and objective provisions of a zoning ordinance,
LC000266 - Page 18 of 29
1 except where such is prohibited by environmental land use restrictions recorded on the property by
2 the state of Rhode Island department of environmental management or the United States
3 Environmental Protection Agency preventing the conversion to residential use.
4 (1) The specific zoning ordinance provisions for adaptive reuse shall exempt adaptive reuse
5 developments from off-street parking requirements of over one space per dwelling unit.
6 (2) Density.
7 (i) For projects that meet the following criteria, zoning ordinances shall allow for high
8 density development and shall not limit the density to less than fifteen (15) dwelling units per acre:
9 (A) Where the project is limited to the existing footprint, except that the footprint is allowed
10 to be expanded to accommodate upgrades related to the building and fire codes and utilities; and
11 (B) The development includes at least twenty percent (20%) low- and moderate-income
12 housing; and
13 (C) The development has access to public sewer and water service or has access to adequate
14 private water, such as a well and and/or wastewater treatment system(s) approved by the relevant
15 state agency for the entire development as applicable.
16 (ii) For all other adaptive reuse projects, the residential density permitted in the converted
17 structure shall be the maximum allowed that otherwise meets all standards of minimum housing
18 and has access to public sewer and water service or has access to adequate private water, such as a
19 well, and wastewater treatment system(s) approved by the relevant state agency for the entire
20 development, as applicable. The density proposed shall be determined to meet all public health and
21 safety standards.
22 (3) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, for adaptive reuse projects,
23 existing building setbacks shall remain and shall be considered legal nonconforming, but no
24 additional encroachments shall be permitted into any nonconforming setback, unless otherwise
25 allowed by zoning ordinance or relief is granted by the applicable authority.
26 (4) For adaptive reuse projects, notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the
27 height of the existing structure, if it exceeds the maximum height of the zoning district, may remain
28 and shall be considered legal nonconforming, and any rooftop construction shall be included within
29 the height exemption.
30 (i) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, all towns and cities may allow
31 manufactured homes that comply with § 23-27.3-109.1.3 as a type of single-family home on any
32 lot zoned for single-family use. Such home shall comply with all dimensional requirements of a
33 single-family home in the district or seek relief for the same under the provisions of this chapter.
34 45-24-39. General provisions — Nonconforming development.
LC000266 - Page 19 of 29
1 (a) Any city or town adopting or amending a zoning ordinance under this chapter shall
2 make provision for any use, activity, structure, building, or sign or other improvement, lawfully
3 existing at the time of the adoption or amendment of the zoning ordinance, but which is lawfully
4 established as nonconforming by use or nonconforming by dimension. The zoning ordinance may
5 regulate development which is nonconforming by dimension differently than that which is
6 nonconforming by use.
7 (b) The zoning ordinance shall permit the continuation of nonconforming development;
8 however, this does not prohibit the regulation of nuisances. The continuation of nonconforming
9 development shall only relate to zoning. It shall not be construed to provide any right to
10 continuation of non-compliance with building codes, any right to continuation of non-compliance
11 with the provisions of chapters 24.2 and 24.3 of title 45, any right to continuation of noncompliance
12 with the provisions of chapter 23 of title 46, or any right to continuation of noncompliance with
13 any regulations promulgated by the coastal resources management council.
14 (c) A zoning ordinance may shall provide that, if a nonconforming use is abandoned, it
15 may not be reestablished. Abandonment of a nonconforming use zoning use that raises pollution
16 risk consists of some overt act, or failure to act, which leads one to believe that the owner of the
17 nonconforming zoning use that raises pollution risk neither claims nor retains any interest in
18 continuing the nonconforming zoning use that raises pollution risk unless the owner can
19 demonstrate an intent not to abandon the zoning use that raises pollution risk. If any nonconforming
20 zoning use that raises pollution risk is halted for a period of three (3) years, the owner of the
21 nonconforming zoning use that raises pollution risk is presumed to have abandoned the
22 nonconforming zoning use that raises pollution risk, even if there is no intent to abandon the zoning
23 use that raises pollution risk. An involuntary interruption of nonconforming use, as by fire and
24 natural catastrophe, does not establish the intent to abandon the nonconforming use; however, if If
25 any nonconforming use is halted for a period of one year twenty (20) years, the owner of the
26 nonconforming use is presumed to have abandoned the nonconforming use, unless that presumption
27 is rebutted by the presentation of sufficient evidence of intent not to abandon the use. An
28 involuntary interruption of nonconforming use, as by fire and natural catastrophe, does not establish
29 the intent to abandon the nonconforming use. A use that is nonconforming by use because the
30 building or structure contains more dwelling units than are permitted by the use regulations of a
31 zoning ordinance shall never be considered abandoned, unless the zoning use and form district does
32 not permit any residential use.
33 (d) Abandonment of a nonconforming accessory use shall not be construed to imply
34 abandonment of other nonconforming uses of the site.
LC000266 - Page 20 of 29
1 (e) Although nonconformance by dimension shall never be deemed abandoned, the
2 non abandonment of nonconformance by dimension shall not be construed to imply
3 non abandonment of nonconforming uses of the site.
4 (f) In the event that a use that was previously not legally established as a nonconforming
5 use becomes legally established as a nonconforming use, or in the event that a preexisting use that
6 violated the zoning ordinance becomes a legal use due to changes in the zoning ordinance or state
7 law, the building official shall still be required to certify sufficient compliance with applicable
8 codes before the use is officially recorded as a legal use. However, the building official shall not
9 be permitted to levy any penalties or engage in any enforcement actions on the basis of any evidence
10 collected from an examination of the property for the purpose of assessing what alterations, if any,
11 would be necessary to achieve sufficient compliance to record the use as a legal use.
12 45-24-40. General provisions — Alteration of nonconforming development —
13 Alteration of uses established by variance or special use permit.
14 (a) A zoning ordinance may shall permit a nonconforming development to be altered under
15 either of the following conditions:
16 (1) The ordinance may establish a special-use permit, authorizing the alteration, which
17 must be approved by the zoning board of review following the procedure established in this chapter
18 and in the zoning ordinance; or
19 (2) The ordinance may shall allow the reconstruction, addition and enlargement, expansion,
20 intensification, or change in use, of nonconforming development either by permit or by right and
21 may distinguish between the foregoing actions by zoning districts.
22 (b) The ordinance may require that the alteration more closely adheres to the intent and
23 purposes of the zoning ordinance.
24 (c) A use established by variance or special use permit shall not acquire the rights of this
25 section, unless allowed by specific provisions of a municipal zoning ordinance.
26 45-24-43. General provisions — Special conditions.
27 In granting a variance or in making any determination upon which it is required to pass
28 after a public hearing under a zoning ordinance, the zoning board of review or other zoning
29 enforcement agency may apply the special conditions that may, in the opinion of the board or
30 agency, be required to promote the intent and purposes of the comprehensive plan and the zoning
31 ordinance of the city or town. Failure to abide by any special conditions attached to a grant
32 constitutes a zoning violation. Those special conditions shall be based on competent credible
33 evidence on the record, be incorporated into the decision, and may include, but are not limited to,
34 provisions for:
LC000266 - Page 21 of 29
1 (1) Minimizing the adverse impact of the development or redevelopment upon other land,
2 including the type, intensity, design, and performance of activities;
3 (2) Controlling the sequence of development, including when it must be commenced and
4 completed;
5 (3) Controlling the duration of use or development or redevelopment and the time within
6 which any temporary structure must be removed;
7 (4) Assuring satisfactory installation and maintenance of required public improvements;
8 (5) Designating the exact location and nature of development or redevelopment; and
9 (6) Establishing detailed records by submission of drawings, maps, plats, or specifications.
10 45-24-44. General provisions — Creation of vested rights.
11 (a) A zoning ordinance provides protection for the consideration of applications for
12 development or redevelopment that are substantially complete and have been submitted for
13 approval to the appropriate review agency in the city or town prior to enactment of the new zoning
14 ordinance or amendment.
15 (b) Zoning ordinances or other land development ordinances or regulations specify the
16 minimum requirements for a development application to be substantially complete for the purposes
17 of this section.
18 (c) Any application considered by a city or town under the protection of this section shall
19 be reviewed according to the regulations applicable in the zoning ordinance in force at the time the
20 application was submitted.
21 (d) If an application for development or redevelopment under the provisions of this section
22 is approved, reasonable time limits shall be set within which development or redevelopment of the
23 property must begin and within which development or redevelopment must be substantially
24 completed.
25 45-24-46.1. Inclusionary zoning.
26 (a) A zoning ordinance requiring the inclusion of affordable housing as part of a
27 development or redevelopment shall provide that the housing will be affordable housing, as defined
28 in § 42-128-8.1(d)(1); that the affordable housing will constitute not less than fifteen percent (15%)
29 of the total units proposed for the development or redevelopment; and that the units will remain
30 affordable for a period of not less than thirty (30) years from initial occupancy enforced through a
31 land lease and/or deed restriction enforceable by the municipality and the state of Rhode Island. A
32 zoning ordinance that requires the inclusion of affordable housing as part of a development or
33 redevelopment shall specify the threshold in which the inclusion of affordable housing is required,
34 but in no event shall a minimum threshold triggering the inclusion of affordable housing be higher
LC000266 - Page 22 of 29
1 than ten (10) dwelling units. The total number of units for the development may include less than
2 fifteen percent (15%) affordable units after the density bonus described in subsection (c) of this
3 section is determined.
4 (b) A zoning ordinance that includes inclusionary zoning may provide that the affordable
5 housing must be built on-site or it may allow for one or more alternative methods of production,
6 including, but not limited to: off-site construction or rehabilitation; donation of land suitable for
7 development or redevelopment of the required affordable units; and/or the payment of a fee in lieu
8 of the construction or provision of affordable housing units.
9 (c) Density bonus, zoning incentives, and municipal subsidies. For all projects subject
10 to inclusionary zoning, subject to applicable setback, lot width, or frontage requirements or the
11 granting of relief from the same, a municipality shall allow the addition of one market rate unit for
12 each affordable unit required and the minimum lot area per dwelling unit normally required in the
13 applicable zoning district shall be reduced by that amount necessary to accommodate the
14 development. Larger density bonuses for the provision of an increased percentage of affordable
15 housing in a development or redevelopment may be provided by a municipality in the zoning
16 ordinance. The total number of units for the development or redevelopment shall equal the number
17 originally proposed, including the required affordable units, plus the additional units that constitute
18 the density bonus. Local regulations shall provide for reasonable relief from dimensional
19 requirements to accommodate the bonus density under this section. A municipality shall provide,
20 and an applicant may request, additional zoning incentives and/or municipal government subsidies
21 as defined in § 45-53-3 to offset differential costs of affordable units. Available zoning incentives
22 and municipal government subsidies may be listed in the zoning ordinance, but shall not be an
23 exclusive list.
24 (d) Fee-in-lieu. To the extent a municipality provides an option for the payment of a fee-
25 in-lieu of the construction or provision of affordable housing, and an application seeks to utilize
26 fee-in-lieu, the use of such fee shall be the choice of the developer or builder applied on a per-unit
27 basis and may be used for new developments or redevelopments, purchasing property and/or
28 homes, rehabilitating properties, or any other manner that creates additional low- or moderate-
29 income housing as defined in § 45-53-3(9).
30 (1) Eligibility for density bonus. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, an
31 application that utilizes a fee-in-lieu, off-site construction or rehabilitation, or donation of land
32 suitable for development or redevelopment of the required affordable units shall not be eligible for
33 the density bonus outlined in this section.
34 (2) An application that seeks to utilize a fee-in-lieu of the construction or provision of
LC000266 - Page 23 of 29
1 affordable housing must be reviewed by the planning board or commission and is not eligible for
2 administrative review under the Rhode Island Land Development and Subdivision Review
3 Enabling Act of 1992, codified at §§ 45-23-25 — 45-23-74.
4 (3) Amount of fee-in-lieu. For affordable single-family homes and condominium units, the
5 per-unit fee shall be the difference between the maximum affordable sales price for a family of four
6 (4) earning eighty percent (80%) of the area median income as determined annually by the U.S.
7 Department of Housing and Urban Development and the average cost of developing a single unit
8 of affordable housing. The average cost of developing a single unit of affordable housing shall be
9 determined annually based on the average, per-unit development or redevelopment cost of
10 affordable homes financed by Rhode Island housing and mortgage finance corporation (RIHMFC)
11 over the previous three (3) years, excluding existing units that received preservation financing.
12 (i) Notwithstanding subsection (d)(3) of this section, in no case shall the per-unit fee for
13 affordable single family homes and condominium units be less than forty thousand dollars
14 ($40,000).
15 (4) Use of fee-in-lieu. The municipality shall deposit all in-lieu payments into restricted
16 accounts that shall be allocated and spent only for the creation and development or redevelopment
17 of affordable housing within the municipality serving individuals or families at or below eighty
18 percent (80%) of the area median income. The municipality shall maintain a local affordable
19 housing board to oversee the funds in the restricted accounts and shall allocate the funds within
20 three (3) years of collection. The municipality shall include in the housing element of their local
21 comprehensive plan and shall pass by ordinance, the process it will use to allocate the funds.
22 (e) As an alternative to the provisions of subsection (d), the municipality may elect to
23 transfer in-lieu payments promptly upon receipt or within the three-year (3) period after receipt. A
24 municipality shall transfer all fee-in-lieu payments that are not allocated within three (3) years of
25 collection, including funds held as of July 1, 2024, to RIHMFC for the purpose of developing
26 affordable housing within that community.
27 (f) Both the municipalities and RIHMFC shall report annually with the first report due
28 December 31, 2024, to the general assembly, the secretary of housing, and the housing resources
29 commission the amount of fees in lieu collected by community, the projects that were provided
30 funding with the fees, the dollar amounts allocated to the projects, and the number of units created.
31 45-24-46.2. Special provisions — Transfer of development rights — North Kingstown.
32 (a) In addition to other powers granted to towns and cities by this chapter to establish and

LC000266 - Page 24 of 29
1 available to developers and property owners, in the manner set forth in this section.
2 (b) The establishment, as provided for by this section, of a system for transfer of
3 development rights within or between zoning districts, or a portion thereof, designated in the zoning

32 (b) A zoning ordinance adopted pursuant to this chapter that permits or requires the creation
33 of land development projects in one or more zoning districts shall require that any land development
34 project shall be reviewed, in accordance with the procedures established by chapter 23 of this title,
LC000266 - Page 26 of 29

21 (d) In regulating land development projects, an ordinance adopted pursuant to this chapter
22 shall include provisions for zoning incentives that include the adjustment of applicable lot density
23 and dimensional standards where open space is to be permanently set aside for public or common
24 use, and/or where the physical characteristics, location, or size of the site require an adjustment,
25 and/or where the location, size, and type of housing, commercial, industrial, or other use require an
26 adjustment, and/or where housing for low and moderate income families is to be provided, or where
27 other amenities not ordinarily required are provided, as stipulated in the zoning ordinance.

9 (i) A restriction, in perpetuity, enforceable by the city or town or by any owner of property
10 in the cluster or other land development project in which the land is located shall be recorded

12 accessory uses such as parking or roadway; and
13 (ii) The developmental rights and other conservation easements on the land may be held,
14 in perpetuity, by a nonprofit organization, the principal purpose of which is the conservation of
15 open space or resource protection.
16 (3) All open space land provided by a cluster development or other land development
17 project shall be subject to a community-approved management plan that will specify the permitted
18 uses for the open space.
19 45-24-48. Special provisions — Preapplication conference.

24 to the parcel, as well as the zoning and other ordinances that affect the proposed development or
25 redevelopment;

15 conformity; if a use has been in existence for fifty (50) years; or if a non-accessory use has been in
16 existence for twenty-five (25) years without the initiation of any enforcement actions to ensure

18 the number of dwelling units exceeds the limits established by the use regulations of a zoning
19 ordinance, the nonconformance shall be established if the dwelling units were lawfully existing
20 prior to the enactment of a zoning ordinance or a zoning amendment that rendered the use out of

27 amendment that rendered the zoning use that raises pollution risk out of conformity.
28 (ii) Nonconforming by dimension: a building, structure, or parcel of land not in compliance
29 with the dimensional regulations of the zoning ordinance. Dimensional regulations include all
30 regulations of the zoning ordinance, other than those pertaining to the permitted uses. A building
31 or structure containing more dwelling units than are permitted by the use regulations of a zoning
32 ordinance is nonconforming by use; a building or structure containing a permitted number of
33 dwelling units by the use regulations of the zoning ordinance, but not meeting the lot area per
34 dwelling unit regulations, is nonconforming by dimension.

3 and local regulations, to establish its own minimum lot size per zoning district in its town or city.
4 45-24-34. General provisions — Purpose and consistency with comprehensive plan.
5 (a) A zoning ordinance adopted pursuant to this chapter shall provide a statement of its
6 purposes. Those purposes shall be consistent with § 45-24-30. A zoning ordinance adopted or
7 amended pursuant to this chapter shall include a statement that the zoning ordinance is consistent
8 with the comprehensive plan of the city or town adopted pursuant to chapter 22.2 of this title, or as
9 otherwise provided below and shall provide that in the instance of uncertainty in the construction
10 or application of any section of the ordinance, the ordinance shall be construed in a manner that
11 will further the implementation of, and not be contrary to, the goals and policies and applicable
12 elements of the comprehensive plan.
13 (b) The city or town shall bring the zoning ordinance or amendment into conformance with
14 its comprehensive plan as approved by the chief of the division of planning of the department of
15 administration or the superior court in accordance with its implementation schedule as set forth in
16 said plan, a period no longer than three (3) years. A zoning ordinance shall address and specify
17 requirements for the coordination between contiguous communities, the state, and other agencies,
18 as required by chapter 22.2 of this title.
19 45-24-36. General provisions — Division into districts.
20 A zoning ordinance divides a city or town into zoning use and form districts, which may
21 include overlay districts and floating zone districts, of the number, kind, type, shape, and area
22 suitable to carry out the purposes of this chapter. Regulations and standards shall be consistent for
23 each land use, type of development and redevelopment, or type of building or structure within a
24 district, but may differ from those in other districts. Zoning use and form districts shall be depicted
25 by type and location on the zoning map.
26 45-24-37. General provisions — Permitted uses.
27 (a) The zoning ordinance shall provide a listing of all land uses and/or performance
28 standards for uses that are permitted within the zoning use and form districts of the municipality.
29 The ordinance may provide for a procedure under which a proposed land use that is not specifically
30 listed may be presented by the property owner to the zoning board of review or to a local official
31 or agency charged with administration and enforcement of the ordinance for an evaluation and
32 determination of whether the proposed use is of a similar type, character, and intensity as a listed
33 permitted use. Upon such determination, the proposed use may be considered to be a permitted use.
34 (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the following uses are permitted
LC000266 - Page 17 of 29

1 uses within all residential zoning use and form districts of a municipality and all industrial and
2 commercial zoning use and form districts except where residential use is prohibited for public
3 health or safety reasons:
4 (1) Households;
5 (2) Community residences; and
6 (3) Family daycare homes.
7 (c) Any time a building or other structure used for residential purposes, or a portion of a
8 building containing residential units, is rendered uninhabitable by virtue of a casualty such as fire
9 or flood, the owner of the property is allowed to park, temporarily, mobile and manufactured home,
10 or homes, as the need may be, elsewhere upon the land, for use and occupancy of the former
11 occupants for a period of up to twelve (12) months, or until the building or structure is rehabilitated
12 and otherwise made fit for occupancy. The property owner, or a properly designated agent of the
13 owner, is only allowed to cause the mobile and manufactured home, or homes, to remain
14 temporarily upon the land by making timely application to the local building official for the
15 purposes of obtaining the necessary permits to repair or rebuild redevelop the structure.
16 (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, appropriate access for people with
17 disabilities to residential structures is allowed as a reasonable accommodation for any person(s)
18 residing, or intending to reside, in the residential structure.
19 (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, an accessory dwelling unit
20 (“ADU”) that meets the requirements of §§ 45-24-31 and 45-24-73(a) shall be a permitted use in
21 all residential zoning districts. An ADU that meets the requirements of §§ 45-24-31 and 45-24-
22 73(a) shall be permitted through an administrative building permit process only.
23 (f) When used in this section the terms “people with disabilities” or “member, or members,
24 with disabilities” means a person(s) who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially
25 limits one or more major life activities, as defined in 42-87-1(5).
26 (g) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, plant agriculture is a permitted
27 use within all zoning districts of a municipality, including all industrial and commercial zoning
28 districts, except where prohibited for public health or safety reasons or the protection of wildlife
29 habitat.
30 (h) Adaptive reuse. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, adaptive reuse
31 for the conversion of any commercial building, including offices, schools, religious facilities,
32 medical buildings, and malls into residential units or mixed-use developments which include the
33 development of at least fifty percent (50%) of the existing gross floor area into residential units,
34 shall be a permitted use and allowed by specific and objective provisions of a zoning ordinance,
LC000266 - Page 18 of 29

1 except where such is prohibited by environmental land use restrictions recorded on the property by
2 the state of Rhode Island department of environmental management or the United States
3 Environmental Protection Agency preventing the conversion to residential use.
4 (1) The specific zoning ordinance provisions for adaptive reuse shall exempt adaptive reuse
5 developments from off-street parking requirements of over one space per dwelling unit.
6 (2) Density.
7 (i) For projects that meet the following criteria, zoning ordinances shall allow for high
8 density development and shall not limit the density to less than fifteen (15) dwelling units per acre:
9 (A) Where the project is limited to the existing footprint, except that the footprint is allowed
10 to be expanded to accommodate upgrades related to the building and fire codes and utilities; and
11 (B) The development includes at least twenty percent (20%) low- and moderate-income
12 housing; and
13 (C) The development has access to public sewer and water service or has access to adequate
14 private water, such as a well and and/or wastewater treatment system(s) approved by the relevant
15 state agency for the entire development as applicable.
16 (ii) For all other adaptive reuse projects, the residential density permitted in the converted
17 structure shall be the maximum allowed that otherwise meets all standards of minimum housing
18 and has access to public sewer and water service or has access to adequate private water, such as a
19 well, and wastewater treatment system(s) approved by the relevant state agency for the entire
20 development, as applicable. The density proposed shall be determined to meet all public health and
21 safety standards.
22 (3) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, for adaptive reuse projects,
23 existing building setbacks shall remain and shall be considered legal nonconforming, but no
24 additional encroachments shall be permitted into any nonconforming setback, unless otherwise
25 allowed by zoning ordinance or relief is granted by the applicable authority.
26 (4) For adaptive reuse projects, notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the
27 height of the existing structure, if it exceeds the maximum height of the zoning district, may remain
28 and shall be considered legal nonconforming, and any rooftop construction shall be included within
29 the height exemption.
30 (i) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, all towns and cities may allow
31 manufactured homes that comply with § 23-27.3-109.1.3 as a type of single-family home on any
32 lot zoned for single-family use. Such home shall comply with all dimensional requirements of a
33 single-family home in the district or seek relief for the same under the provisions of this chapter.
34 45-24-39. General provisions — Nonconforming development.
LC000266 - Page 19 of 29

1 (a) Any city or town adopting or amending a zoning ordinance under this chapter shall
2 make provision for any use, activity, structure, building, or sign or other improvement, lawfully
3 existing at the time of the adoption or amendment of the zoning ordinance, but which is lawfully
4 established as nonconforming by use or nonconforming by dimension. The zoning ordinance may
5 regulate development which is nonconforming by dimension differently than that which is
6 nonconforming by use.
7 (b) The zoning ordinance shall permit the continuation of nonconforming development;
8 however, this does not prohibit the regulation of nuisances. The continuation of nonconforming
9 development shall only relate to zoning. It shall not be construed to provide any right to
10 continuation of non-compliance with building codes, any right to continuation of non-compliance
11 with the provisions of chapters 24.2 and 24.3 of title 45, any right to continuation of noncompliance
12 with the provisions of chapter 23 of title 46, or any right to continuation of noncompliance with
13 any regulations promulgated by the coastal resources management council.
14 (c) A zoning ordinance may shall provide that, if a nonconforming use is abandoned, it
15 may not be reestablished. Abandonment of a nonconforming use zoning use that raises pollution
16 risk consists of some overt act, or failure to act, which leads one to believe that the owner of the
17 nonconforming zoning use that raises pollution risk neither claims nor retains any interest in
18 continuing the nonconforming zoning use that raises pollution risk unless the owner can
19 demonstrate an intent not to abandon the zoning use that raises pollution risk. If any nonconforming
20 zoning use that raises pollution risk is halted for a period of three (3) years, the owner of the
21 nonconforming zoning use that raises pollution risk is presumed to have abandoned the
22 nonconforming zoning use that raises pollution risk, even if there is no intent to abandon the zoning
23 use that raises pollution risk. An involuntary interruption of nonconforming use, as by fire and
24 natural catastrophe, does not establish the intent to abandon the nonconforming use; however, if If
25 any nonconforming use is halted for a period of one year twenty (20) years, the owner of the
26 nonconforming use is presumed to have abandoned the nonconforming use, unless that presumption
27 is rebutted by the presentation of sufficient evidence of intent not to abandon the use. An
28 involuntary interruption of nonconforming use, as by fire and natural catastrophe, does not establish
29 the intent to abandon the nonconforming use. A use that is nonconforming by use because the
30 building or structure contains more dwelling units than are permitted by the use regulations of a
31 zoning ordinance shall never be considered abandoned, unless the zoning use and form district does
32 not permit any residential use.
33 (d) Abandonment of a nonconforming accessory use shall not be construed to imply
34 abandonment of other nonconforming uses of the site.
LC000266 - Page 20 of 29

1 (e) Although nonconformance by dimension shall never be deemed abandoned, the
2 non abandonment of nonconformance by dimension shall not be construed to imply
3 non abandonment of nonconforming uses of the site.
4 (f) In the event that a use that was previously not legally established as a nonconforming
5 use becomes legally established as a nonconforming use, or in the event that a preexisting use that
6 violated the zoning ordinance becomes a legal use due to changes in the zoning ordinance or state
7 law, the building official shall still be required to certify sufficient compliance with applicable
8 codes before the use is officially recorded as a legal use. However, the building official shall not
9 be permitted to levy any penalties or engage in any enforcement actions on the basis of any evidence
10 collected from an examination of the property for the purpose of assessing what alterations, if any,
11 would be necessary to achieve sufficient compliance to record the use as a legal use.
12 45-24-40. General provisions — Alteration of nonconforming development —
13 Alteration of uses established by variance or special use permit.
14 (a) A zoning ordinance may shall permit a nonconforming development to be altered under
15 either of the following conditions:
16 (1) The ordinance may establish a special-use permit, authorizing the alteration, which
17 must be approved by the zoning board of review following the procedure established in this chapter
18 and in the zoning ordinance; or
19 (2) The ordinance may shall allow the reconstruction, addition and enlargement, expansion,
20 intensification, or change in use, of nonconforming development either by permit or by right and
21 may distinguish between the foregoing actions by zoning districts.
22 (b) The ordinance may require that the alteration more closely adheres to the intent and
23 purposes of the zoning ordinance.
24 (c) A use established by variance or special use permit shall not acquire the rights of this
25 section, unless allowed by specific provisions of a municipal zoning ordinance.
26 45-24-43. General provisions — Special conditions.
27 In granting a variance or in making any determination upon which it is required to pass
28 after a public hearing under a zoning ordinance, the zoning board of review or other zoning
29 enforcement agency may apply the special conditions that may, in the opinion of the board or
30 agency, be required to promote the intent and purposes of the comprehensive plan and the zoning
31 ordinance of the city or town. Failure to abide by any special conditions attached to a grant
32 constitutes a zoning violation. Those special conditions shall be based on competent credible
33 evidence on the record, be incorporated into the decision, and may include, but are not limited to,
34 provisions for:
LC000266 - Page 21 of 29

1 (1) Minimizing the adverse impact of the development or redevelopment upon other land,
2 including the type, intensity, design, and performance of activities;
3 (2) Controlling the sequence of development, including when it must be commenced and
4 completed;
5 (3) Controlling the duration of use or development or redevelopment and the time within
6 which any temporary structure must be removed;
7 (4) Assuring satisfactory installation and maintenance of required public improvements;
8 (5) Designating the exact location and nature of development or redevelopment; and
9 (6) Establishing detailed records by submission of drawings, maps, plats, or specifications.
10 45-24-44. General provisions — Creation of vested rights.
11 (a) A zoning ordinance provides protection for the consideration of applications for
12 development or redevelopment that are substantially complete and have been submitted for
13 approval to the appropriate review agency in the city or town prior to enactment of the new zoning
14 ordinance or amendment.
15 (b) Zoning ordinances or other land development ordinances or regulations specify the
16 minimum requirements for a development application to be substantially complete for the purposes
17 of this section.
18 (c) Any application considered by a city or town under the protection of this section shall
19 be reviewed according to the regulations applicable in the zoning ordinance in force at the time the
20 application was submitted.
21 (d) If an application for development or redevelopment under the provisions of this section
22 is approved, reasonable time limits shall be set within which development or redevelopment of the
23 property must begin and within which development or redevelopment must be substantially
24 completed.
25 45-24-46.1. Inclusionary zoning.
26 (a) A zoning ordinance requiring the inclusion of affordable housing as part of a
27 development or redevelopment shall provide that the housing will be affordable housing, as defined
28 in § 42-128-8.1(d)(1); that the affordable housing will constitute not less than fifteen percent (15%)
29 of the total units proposed for the development or redevelopment; and that the units will remain
30 affordable for a period of not less than thirty (30) years from initial occupancy enforced through a
31 land lease and/or deed restriction enforceable by the municipality and the state of Rhode Island. A
32 zoning ordinance that requires the inclusion of affordable housing as part of a development or
33 redevelopment shall specify the threshold in which the inclusion of affordable housing is required,
34 but in no event shall a minimum threshold triggering the inclusion of affordable housing be higher
LC000266 - Page 22 of 29

1 than ten (10) dwelling units. The total number of units for the development may include less than
2 fifteen percent (15%) affordable units after the density bonus described in subsection (c) of this
3 section is determined.
4 (b) A zoning ordinance that includes inclusionary zoning may provide that the affordable
5 housing must be built on-site or it may allow for one or more alternative methods of production,
6 including, but not limited to: off-site construction or rehabilitation; donation of land suitable for
7 development or redevelopment of the required affordable units; and/or the payment of a fee in lieu
8 of the construction or provision of affordable housing units.
9 (c) Density bonus, zoning incentives, and municipal subsidies. For all projects subject
10 to inclusionary zoning, subject to applicable setback, lot width, or frontage requirements or the
11 granting of relief from the same, a municipality shall allow the addition of one market rate unit for
12 each affordable unit required and the minimum lot area per dwelling unit normally required in the
13 applicable zoning district shall be reduced by that amount necessary to accommodate the
14 development. Larger density bonuses for the provision of an increased percentage of affordable
15 housing in a development or redevelopment may be provided by a municipality in the zoning
16 ordinance. The total number of units for the development or redevelopment shall equal the number
17 originally proposed, including the required affordable units, plus the additional units that constitute
18 the density bonus. Local regulations shall provide for reasonable relief from dimensional
19 requirements to accommodate the bonus density under this section. A municipality shall provide,
20 and an applicant may request, additional zoning incentives and/or municipal government subsidies
21 as defined in § 45-53-3 to offset differential costs of affordable units. Available zoning incentives
22 and municipal government subsidies may be listed in the zoning ordinance, but shall not be an
23 exclusive list.
24 (d) Fee-in-lieu. To the extent a municipality provides an option for the payment of a fee-
25 in-lieu of the construction or provision of affordable housing, and an application seeks to utilize
26 fee-in-lieu, the use of such fee shall be the choice of the developer or builder applied on a per-unit
27 basis and may be used for new developments or redevelopments, purchasing property and/or
28 homes, rehabilitating properties, or any other manner that creates additional low- or moderate-
29 income housing as defined in § 45-53-3(9).
30 (1) Eligibility for density bonus. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, an
31 application that utilizes a fee-in-lieu, off-site construction or rehabilitation, or donation of land
32 suitable for development or redevelopment of the required affordable units shall not be eligible for
33 the density bonus outlined in this section.
34 (2) An application that seeks to utilize a fee-in-lieu of the construction or provision of
LC000266 - Page 23 of 29

1 affordable housing must be reviewed by the planning board or commission and is not eligible for
2 administrative review under the Rhode Island Land Development and Subdivision Review
3 Enabling Act of 1992, codified at §§ 45-23-25 — 45-23-74.
4 (3) Amount of fee-in-lieu. For affordable single-family homes and condominium units, the
5 per-unit fee shall be the difference between the maximum affordable sales price for a family of four
6 (4) earning eighty percent (80%) of the area median income as determined annually by the U.S.
7 Department of Housing and Urban Development and the average cost of developing a single unit
8 of affordable housing. The average cost of developing a single unit of affordable housing shall be
9 determined annually based on the average, per-unit development or redevelopment cost of
10 affordable homes financed by Rhode Island housing and mortgage finance corporation (RIHMFC)
11 over the previous three (3) years, excluding existing units that received preservation financing.
12 (i) Notwithstanding subsection (d)(3) of this section, in no case shall the per-unit fee for
13 affordable single family homes and condominium units be less than forty thousand dollars
14 ($40,000).
15 (4) Use of fee-in-lieu. The municipality shall deposit all in-lieu payments into restricted
16 accounts that shall be allocated and spent only for the creation and development or redevelopment
17 of affordable housing within the municipality serving individuals or families at or below eighty
18 percent (80%) of the area median income. The municipality shall maintain a local affordable
19 housing board to oversee the funds in the restricted accounts and shall allocate the funds within
20 three (3) years of collection. The municipality shall include in the housing element of their local
21 comprehensive plan and shall pass by ordinance, the process it will use to allocate the funds.
22 (e) As an alternative to the provisions of subsection (d), the municipality may elect to
23 transfer in-lieu payments promptly upon receipt or within the three-year (3) period after receipt. A
24 municipality shall transfer all fee-in-lieu payments that are not allocated within three (3) years of
25 collection, including funds held as of July 1, 2024, to RIHMFC for the purpose of developing
26 affordable housing within that community.
27 (f) Both the municipalities and RIHMFC shall report annually with the first report due
28 December 31, 2024, to the general assembly, the secretary of housing, and the housing resources
29 commission the amount of fees in lieu collected by community, the projects that were provided
30 funding with the fees, the dollar amounts allocated to the projects, and the number of units created.
31 45-24-46.2. Special provisions — Transfer of development rights — North Kingstown.
32 (a) In addition to other powers granted to towns and cities by this chapter to establish and
33 administer transfer of development rights programs, the town council of the town of North
34 Kingstown may provide by ordinance for the transfer of development rights, as a voluntary program
LC000266 - Page 24 of 29

1 available to developers and property owners, in the manner set forth in this section.
2 (b) The establishment, as provided for by this section, of a system for transfer of
3 development rights within or between zoning districts, or a portion thereof, designated in the zoning

23 and dimensional standards where open space is to be permanently set aside for public or common
24 use, and/or where the physical characteristics, location, or size of the site require an adjustment,
25 and/or where the location, size, and type of housing, commercial, industrial, or other use require an
26 adjustment, and/or where housing for low and moderate income families is to be provided, or where
27 other amenities not ordinarily required are provided, as stipulated in the zoning ordinance.
28 Provision may be made for adjustment of applicable lot density and dimensional standards for
29 payment or donation of other land or facilities in lieu of an on-site provision of an amenity that

9 (i) A restriction, in perpetuity, enforceable by the city or town or by any owner of property
10 in the cluster or other land development project in which the land is located shall be recorded

12 accessory uses such as parking or roadway; and
13 (ii) The developmental rights and other conservation easements on the land may be held,
14 in perpetuity, by a nonprofit organization, the principal purpose of which is the conservation of
15 open space or resource protection.
16 (3) All open space land provided by a cluster development or other land development
17 project shall be subject to a community-approved management plan that will specify the permitted
18 uses for the open space.
