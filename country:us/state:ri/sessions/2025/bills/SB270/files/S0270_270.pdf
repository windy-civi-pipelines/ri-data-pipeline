RELATING TO HEALTH AND SAFETY -- RHODE ISLAND'S CHILDREN DESERVE
HELP NOT HARM ACT -- MINOR'S GENDER TRANSITION
Introduced By: Senator E Morgan
Date Introduced: February 13, 2025
Referred To: Senate Health & Human Services
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Legislative findings and purpose.
2 The general assembly finds that:
3 (1) Rhode Island has a compelling government interest protecting the health and safety of
4 its citizens, especially vulnerable children;
5 (2) Only a small percentage of the American population experiences distress identifying
6 with their biological sex;
7 (3) For the small percentage of children who are gender nonconforming or experience
8 distress identifying with their biological sex, studies consistently demonstrate that the majority
9 come to embrace their biological sex in adolescence or adulthood, thereby rendering most medical
10 physiological interventions unnecessary;
11 (4) Scientific studies show that individuals experiencing distress identifying with their
12 biological sex have often experienced severe psychopathology preceding their gender dysphoria,
13 which indicates these individuals could benefit greatly from access to mental healthcare services;
14 (5) Even among individuals who have undergone inpatient gender reassignment
15 procedures, suicide rates, psychiatric morbidities, and mortality rates remain markedly elevated
16 above the background population;
17 (6) Some healthcare professionals are prescribing puberty-blocking drugs such as
18 gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues, in order to delay the natural onset or progression of

1 puberty in children, who experience distress identifying with their biological sex:
2 (i) Puberty-blocking drugs are being prescribed, despite the lack of any long-term
3 longitudinal studies evaluating the risks and benefits of using these drugs for the treatment of such
4 distress or gender dysphoria; and
5 (ii) Puberty-blocking drugs are being prescribed in an off-label and experimental manner
6 on children;
7 (7) Some healthcare professionals are also prescribing cross-sex hormones for children
8 who are experiencing distress identifying with their biological sex, despite the fact no randomized
9 clinical trials have been conducted on the efficacy or safety of the use of cross-sex hormones in
10 adults or children for the purpose of gender transition;
11 (8) The use of cross-sex hormones comes with serious known risks:
12 (i) For biological females, some risks may include;
13 (A) Irreversible infertility;
14 (B) Severe liver dysfunction;
15 (C) Coronary artery disease, including heart attacks;
16 (D) Increased risk of breast, cervical, and uterine cancers;
17 (E) Cerebrovascular disease, including strokes;
18 (F) Hypertension;
19 (G) Erythrocytosis, which is an increase in red blood cells;
20 (H) Sleep apnea;
21 (I) Type 2 diabetes;
22 (J) Loss of bone density;
23 (K) Destabilization of psychiatric disorders; and
24 (ii) For biological males, some risks may include:
25 (A) Irreversible infertility;
26 (B) Thromboembolic disease, including blood clots;
27 (C) Cholelithiasis, including gallstones;
28 (D) Coronary artery disease, including heart attacks;
29 (E) Type 2 diabetes;
30 (F) Breast cancer;
31 (G) Macroprolactinoma, which is a tumor of the pituitary gland;
32 (H) Cerebrovascular disease, including strokes; and
33 (I) Hypertriglyceridemia, which is an elevated level of triglycerides in the blood;
34 (9) Genital and non-genital gender reassignment surgeries are generally not recommended
LC000385 - Page 2 of 11

1 for children, although evidence indicates referrals for children to have such surgeries are becoming
2 more frequent;
3 (10) Genital gender reassignment surgery includes several irreversible invasive procedures
4 for males and females and involves the alteration of biologically healthy and functional body parts.
5 These procedures are generally irreversible;
6 (i) For biological males, surgery may involve:
7 (A) Genital reconstruction, including a penectomy, which is the removal of the penis;
8 (B) Orchiectomy, which is the removal of the testicles;
9 (C) Vaginoplasty, which is the construction of a vagina-like structure, typically through a
10 penile inversion procedure;
11 (D) Clitoroplasty which is the construction of a clitoris-like structure; and
12 (E) Vulvoplasty, which is the construction of a vulva-like structure;
13 (ii) For biological females, surgery may involve:
14 (A) Hysterectomy or oophorectomy;
15 (B) Reconstruction of the urethra;
16 (C) Genital reconstruction including metoidioplasty or phalloplasty, which is the
17 construction of a penis-like structure;
18 (D) Vaginectomy, which is the removal of the vagina;
19 (E) Scrotoplasty, which is the construction of a scrotum-like structure; and
20 (F) Implantation of erection and/or testicular prosthesis;
21 (iii) The complications, risks, and long-term care concerns associated with genital sex
22 reassignment surgery, for both males and females, are numerous and complex;
23 (iv) Non-genital sex reassignment surgery includes various invasive procedures for males
24 and females and also involves the alteration or removal of biologically health, and functional body
25 parts:
26 (A) For biological males, this surgery may involve:
27 (I) Augmentation mammoplasty;
28 (II) Facial feminization surgery;
29 (III) Liposuction;
30 (IV) Lipofilling;
31 (V) Voice feminization surgery;
32 (VI) Thyroid cartilage reduction;
33 (VII) Gluteal augmentation;
34 (VIII) Hair reconstruction; and
LC000385 - Page 3 of 11

1 (IX) Other aesthetic procedures;
2 (B) For biological females, this surgery may involve:
3 (I) Subcutaneous mastectomy;
4 (II) Voice masculinization surgery;
5 (III) Liposuction;
6 (IV) Lipofilling;
7 (V) Pectoral implants; and
8 (VI) Other aesthetic procedures;
9 (11) It is an accepted principle of economics and public policy that when a service or
10 product is subsidized or reimbursed, demand for that service or product increases; and
11 (12) It is of grave concern to this general assembly that the medical community is allowing
12 individuals, who experience distress identifying with their biological sex, to be subjects of
13 irreversible and drastic non-genital gender reassignment surgery and irreversible, permanently
14 sterilizing genital gender reassignment surgeries, despite the lack of studies showing that such
15 extreme interventions have benefits that outweigh their risks or chances of cure. In fact, they may
16 increase the risk of suicide.
17 SECTION 2. Title 23 of the General Laws entitled "HEALTH AND SAFETY" is hereby
18 amended by adding thereto the following chapter:
