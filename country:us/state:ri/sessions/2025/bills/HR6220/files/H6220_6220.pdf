1 WHEREAS, On April 17th of 1975, Cambodia's capital city, Phnom Penh fell, and thus

3 the Khmer Rouge regime under its leader, Pol Pot; and
4 WHEREAS, Beginning on that fateful day, and for the next four years, almost 25 percent
5 of the Cambodian nation's population were starved, tortured, and murdered; and
6 WHEREAS, Thousands of Cambodians fled their homeland, seeking refuge in camps in
7 Thailand before eventually being admitted into several nations, including the United States; and

9 Rouge Commander who over the past four decades has consolidated his power by threatening,
10 outlawing, and arresting those who oppose him; and
11 WHEREAS, Rhode Island is now home to a vibrant Cambodian-American population,
12 that have greatly contributed to the rich diversity of our State's culture; and
