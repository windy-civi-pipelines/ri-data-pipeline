24 (2) The analysis shall include examining the impact of merging the individual and small-
25 employer markets on premiums charged to individuals and small-employer groups.
26 (3) The analysis shall include examining the impact on rates in each of the individual and
27 small-employer health insurance markets and the number of insureds in the context of possible
28 changes to the rating guidelines used for small-employer groups, including: community rating

18 (i) The use of the National Correct Coding Initiative code-edit policy by payors and

29 providers.
30 (vi) Nothing in this section, nor in the guidelines developed, shall inhibit an individual
31 payor’s ability to employ, and not disclose to providers, temporary code edits for the purpose of

23 authorization requirements, based on stratification of healthcare providers’ performance and

25 provider organizations. Such criteria shall be transparent and easily accessible to contracted
26 providers. Such selective prior authorization programs shall be available when healthcare providers
27 participate directly with the insurer in risk-based payment contracts and may be available to
28 providers who do not participate in risk-based contracts;
29 (vi) Require the review of medical services, including behavioral health services, and
30 prescription drugs, subject to prior authorization on at least an annual basis, with the input of

13 (viii) Increase and strengthen continuity of patient care by:
14 (A) Defining protections for continuity of care during a transition period for patients

18 by allowing a grace period of coverage to allow consideration of referred health plan options or
19 establishment of medical necessity of the current course of treatment;
20 (B) Requiring continuity of care for medical services, including behavioral health services,
21 and prescription medications for patients on appropriate, chronic, stable therapy through

14 to read as follows:
15 42-14.5-3. Powers and duties.
16 The health insurance commissioner shall have the following powers and duties:
17 (a) To conduct quarterly public meetings throughout the state, separate and distinct from
18 rate hearings pursuant to § 42-62-13, regarding the rates, services, and operations of insurers
19 licensed to provide health insurance in the state; the effects of such rates, services, and operations
20 on consumers, medical care providers, patients, and the market environment in which the insurers
21 operate; and efforts to bring new health insurers into the Rhode Island market. Notice of not less
22 than ten (10) days of the hearing(s) shall go to the general assembly, the governor, the Rhode Island
23 Medical Society, the Hospital Association of Rhode Island, the director of health, the attorney
24 general, and the chambers of commerce. Public notice shall be posted on the department’s website
25 and given in the newspaper of general circulation, and to any entity in writing requesting notice.
26 (b) To make recommendations to the governor and the house of representatives and senate
27 finance committees regarding healthcare insurance and the regulations, rates, services,
28 administrative expenses, reserve requirements, and operations of insurers providing health
29 insurance in the state, and to prepare or comment on, upon the request of the governor or
30 chairpersons of the house or senate finance committees, draft legislation to improve the regulation
31 of health insurance. In making the recommendations, the commissioner shall recognize that it is
32 the intent of the legislature that the maximum disclosure be provided regarding the reasonableness
33 of individual administrative expenditures as well as total administrative costs. The commissioner
34 shall make recommendations on the levels of reserves, including consideration of: targeted reserve
LC001524 - Page 4 of 16

1 levels; trends in the increase or decrease of reserve levels; and insurer plans for distributing excess
2 reserves.
3 (c) To establish a consumer/business/labor/medical advisory council to obtain information
4 and present concerns of consumers, business, and medical providers affected by health insurance
5 decisions. The council shall develop proposals to allow the market for small business health
6 insurance to be affordable and fairer. The council shall be involved in the planning and conduct of
7 the quarterly public meetings in accordance with subsection (a). The advisory council shall develop
8 measures to inform small businesses of an insurance complaint process to ensure that small
9 businesses that experience rate increases in a given year may request and receive a formal review
10 by the department. The advisory council shall assess views of the health provider community
11 relative to insurance rates of reimbursement, billing, and reimbursement procedures, and the
12 insurers’ role in promoting efficient and high-quality health care. The advisory council shall issue
13 an annual report of findings and recommendations to the governor and the general assembly and
14 present its findings at hearings before the house and senate finance committees. The advisory
15 council is to be diverse in interests and shall include representatives of community consumer
16 organizations; small businesses, other than those involved in the sale of insurance products; and
17 hospital, medical, and other health provider organizations. Such representatives shall be nominated

23 composed of healthcare providers and Rhode Island licensed health plans. This subcommittee shall
24 include in its annual report and presentation before the house and senate finance committees the
25 following information:
26 (1) A method whereby health plans shall disclose to contracted providers the fee schedules

32 hospital or medical service corporations, as defined by chapters 19 and 20 of title 27, to make
33 facility-specific data and other medical service-specific data available in reasonably consistent
34 formats to patients regarding quality and costs. This information would help consumers make
LC001524 - Page 5 of 16

1 informed choices regarding the facilities and clinicians or physician practices at which to seek care.
2 Among the items considered would be the unique health services and other public goods provided
3 by facilities and clinicians or physician practices in establishing the most appropriate cost
4 comparisons;
5 (5) All activities related to contractual disclosure to participating providers of the
6 mechanisms for resolving health plan/provider disputes;
7 (6) The uniform process being utilized for confirming, in real time, patient insurance
8 enrollment status, benefits coverage, including copays and deductibles;
9 (7) Information related to temporary credentialing of providers seeking to participate in the
10 plan’s network and the impact of the activity on health plan accreditation;

17 (g) To analyze the impact of changing the rating guidelines and/or merging the individual
18 health insurance market, as defined in chapter 18.5 of title 27, and the small-employer health
19 insurance market, as defined in chapter 50 of title 27, in accordance with the following:
20 (1) The analysis shall forecast the likely rate increases required to effect the changes
21 recommended pursuant to the preceding subsection (g) in the direct-pay market and small-employer
22 health insurance market over the next five (5) years, based on the current rating structure and
23 current products.
24 (2) The analysis shall include examining the impact of merging the individual and small-
25 employer markets on premiums charged to individuals and small-employer groups.
26 (3) The analysis shall include examining the impact on rates in each of the individual and
27 small-employer health insurance markets and the number of insureds in the context of possible
28 changes to the rating guidelines used for small-employer groups, including: community rating
29 principles; expanding small-employer rate bonds beyond the current range; increasing the employer
30 group size in the small-group market; and/or adding rating factors for broker and/or tobacco use.
31 (4) The analysis shall include examining the adequacy of current statutory and regulatory
32 oversight of the rating process and factors employed by the participants in the proposed, new
33 merged market.
34 (5) The analysis shall include assessment of possible reinsurance mechanisms and/or
LC001524 - Page 6 of 16

1 federal high-risk pool structures and funding to support the health insurance market in Rhode Island

3 risk, and/or by making health insurance affordable for a selected at-risk population.
4 (6) The health insurance commissioner shall work with an insurance market merger task
5 force to assist with the analysis. The task force shall be chaired by the health insurance
6 commissioner and shall include, but not be limited to, representatives of the general assembly, the
7 business community, small-employer carriers as defined in § 27-50-3, carriers offering coverage in
8 the individual market in Rhode Island, health insurance brokers, and members of the general public.
9 (7) For the purposes of conducting this analysis, the commissioner may contract with an
10 outside organization with expertise in fiscal analysis of the private insurance market. In conducting
11 its study, the organization shall, to the extent possible, obtain and use actual health plan data. Said
12 data shall be subject to state and federal laws and regulations governing confidentiality of health
13 care and proprietary information.
14 (8) The task force shall meet as necessary and include its findings in the annual report, and
15 the commissioner shall include the information in the annual presentation before the house and
16 senate finance committees.
17 (h) To establish and convene a workgroup representing healthcare providers and health
18 insurers for the purpose of coordinating the development of processes, guidelines, and standards to
19 streamline healthcare administration that are to be adopted by payors and providers of healthcare
20 services operating in the state. This workgroup shall include representatives with expertise who
21 would contribute to the streamlining of healthcare administration and who are selected from
22 hospitals, physician practices, community behavioral health organizations, each health insurer, and
23 other affected entities. The workgroup shall also include at least one designee each from the Rhode
24 Island Medical Society, Rhode Island Council of Community Mental Health Organizations, the
25 Rhode Island Health Center Association, and the Hospital Association of Rhode Island. In any year
26 that the workgroup meets and submits recommendations to the office of the health insurance
27 commissioner, the office of the health insurance commissioner shall submit such recommendations
28 to the health and human services committees of the Rhode Island house of representatives and the
29 Rhode Island senate prior to the implementation of any such recommendations and subsequently
30 shall submit a report to the general assembly by June 30, 2024. The report shall include the
31 recommendations the commissioner may implement, with supporting rationale. The workgroup
32 shall consider and make recommendations for:
33 (1) Establishing a consistent standard for electronic eligibility and coverage verification.
34 Such standard shall:
LC001524 - Page 7 of 16

1 (i) Include standards for eligibility inquiry and response and, wherever possible, be
2 consistent with the standards adopted by nationally recognized organizations, such as the Centers
3 for Medicare & Medicaid Services;
4 (ii) Enable providers and payors to exchange eligibility requests and responses on a system-
5 to-system basis or using a payor-supported web browser;
6 (iii) Provide reasonably detailed information on a consumer’s eligibility for healthcare
7 coverage; scope of benefits; limitations and exclusions provided under that coverage; cost-sharing
8 requirements for specific services at the specific time of the inquiry; current deductible amounts;
9 accumulated or limited benefits; out-of-pocket maximums; any maximum policy amounts; and
10 other information required for the provider to collect the patient’s portion of the bill;
11 (iv) Reflect the necessary limitations imposed on payors by the originator of the eligibility
12 and benefits information;
13 (v) Recommend a standard or common process to protect all providers from the costs of
14 services to patients who are ineligible for insurance coverage in circumstances where a payor
15 provides eligibility verification based on best information available to the payor at the date of the
16 request of eligibility.
17 (2) Developing implementation guidelines and promoting adoption of the guidelines for:
18 (i) The use of the National Correct Coding Initiative code-edit policy by payors and

24 (iv) Uniformity in the processing of claims by payors; and the processing of corrections to
25 claims by providers and payors;
26 (v) A standard payor-denial review process for providers when they request a

28 common-standards body or process exists and multiple conflicting sources are in use by payors and
29 providers.
30 (vi) Nothing in this section, nor in the guidelines developed, shall inhibit an individual
31 payor’s ability to employ, and not disclose to providers, temporary code edits for the purpose of

34 the application of such edits and that the provider have access to the payor’s review and appeal
LC001524 - Page 8 of 16

1 process to challenge the payor’s adjudication decision.

4 prosecution under applicable law of potentially fraudulent billing activities.
5 (3) Developing and promoting widespread adoption by payors and providers of guidelines
6 to:
7 (i) Ensure payors do not automatically deny claims for services when extenuating
8 circumstances make it impossible for the provider to obtain a preauthorization before services are
9 performed or notify a payor within an appropriate standardized timeline of a patient’s admission;
10 (ii) Require payors to use common and consistent processes and time frames when
11 responding to provider requests for medical management approvals. Whenever possible, such time

17 where providers can obtain payors’ preauthorization, benefits advisory, and preadmission
18 requirements;
19 (iv) Establish guidelines for payors to develop and maintain a website that providers can
20 use to request a preauthorization, including a prospective clinical necessity review; receive an
21 authorization number; and transmit an admission notification;
22 (v) Develop and implement the use of programs that implement selective prior
23 authorization requirements, based on stratification of healthcare providers’ performance and
24 adherence to evidence-based medicine with the input of contracted healthcare providers and/or
25 provider organizations. Such criteria shall be transparent and easily accessible to contracted
26 providers. Such selective prior authorization programs shall be available when healthcare providers
27 participate directly with the insurer in risk-based payment contracts and may be available to
28 providers who do not participate in risk-based contracts;
29 (vi) Require the review of medical services, including behavioral health services, and
30 prescription drugs, subject to prior authorization on at least an annual basis, with the input of
31 contracted healthcare providers and/or provider organizations. Any changes to the list of medical
32 services, including behavioral health services, and prescription drugs requiring prior authorization,
33 shall be shared via provider-accessible websites;
34 (vii) Improve communication channels between health plans, healthcare providers, and
LC001524 - Page 9 of 16

1 patients by:
2 (A) Requiring transparency and easy accessibility of prior authorization requirements,
3 criteria, rationale, and program changes to contracted healthcare providers and patients/health plan
4 enrollees which may be satisfied by posting to provider-accessible and member-accessible
5 websites; and
6 (B) Supporting:
7 (I) Timely submission by healthcare providers of the complete information necessary to
8 make a prior authorization determination, as early in the process as possible; and
9 (II) Timely notification of prior authorization determinations by health plans to impacted
10 health plan enrollees, and healthcare providers, including, but not limited to, ordering providers,
11 and/or rendering providers, and dispensing pharmacists which may be satisfied by posting to
12 provider-accessible websites or similar electronic portals or services;
13 (viii) Increase and strengthen continuity of patient care by:
14 (A) Defining protections for continuity of care during a transition period for patients
15 undergoing an active course of treatment, when there is a formulary or treatment coverage change
16 or change of health plan that may disrupt their current course of treatment and when the treating
17 physician determines that a transition may place the patient at risk; and for prescription medication
18 by allowing a grace period of coverage to allow consideration of referred health plan options or
19 establishment of medical necessity of the current course of treatment;
20 (B) Requiring continuity of care for medical services, including behavioral health services,
21 and prescription medications for patients on appropriate, chronic, stable therapy through
22 minimizing repetitive prior authorization requirements; and which for prescription medication shall
23 be allowed only on an annual review, with exception for labeled limitation, to establish continued
24 benefit of treatment; and
25 (C) Requiring communication between healthcare providers, health plans, and patients to
26 facilitate continuity of care and minimize disruptions in needed treatment which may be satisfied
27 by posting to provider-accessible websites or similar electronic portals or services;
28 (D) Continuity of care for formulary or drug coverage shall distinguish between FDA
29 designated interchangeable products and proprietary or marketed versions of a medication;
30 (ix) Encourage healthcare providers and/or provider organizations and health plans to
31 accelerate use of electronic prior authorization technology, including adoption of national standards
32 where applicable; and
