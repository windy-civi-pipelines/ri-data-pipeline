19 Approving and Ratifying the Agreement between the Towns of Exeter and West Greenwich, Rhode
20 Island, with Respect to the formation of a Regional School District," and the several amendments
21 to the same subsequent thereto, are hereby amended to read as follows:
22 (D) Apportionment of construction and operating costs.
23 Construction and operating costs for the first fiscal year next following the establishment
24 of the regional school district and for every fiscal year thereafter shall be apportioned to the member
25 towns on the basis of their respective pupil enrollments in the regional school system. Beginning
26 with the 2023 fiscal year, apportionment shall be calculated using a phased-in five (5) year rolling
27 enrollment average. Each member town's share of construction and operating costs for each the
28 2023 fiscal year shall be determined by computing the ratio which the town's pupil enrollment in
29 the regional district schools on October 1 of the year next preceding the year for which the
30 apportionment is determined bears to the total pupil enrollment from all the member towns in the
31 regional district schools on the same date. In each successive year, the annual ratio shall be
32 computed in a similar manner, but the apportionment shall be calculated as the average enrollment
33 of fiscal years 2023 and 2024 for fiscal year 2024; as the average enrollment of fiscal years 2023,
34 2024 and 2025 for fiscal year 2025; as the average enrollment of fiscal years 2023, 2024, 2025 and
LC002395 - Page 3 of 6
1 2026 for fiscal year 2026; and as the average enrollment of fiscal years 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026 and
2 2027 for fiscal year 2027. In each successive year thereafter, the apportionment shall be calculated
3 as the average enrollment of the previous five (5) consecutive fiscal years, effectively adding the
4 newest annual enrollment data and dropping the earliest annual enrollment data from the calculation
5 of the average. Calculation of the average to determine the apportionment ratio for each member
6 town in any given fiscal year shall be by adding the total enrollment numbers of said town for each
7 of the fiscal years included in the calculation of the average, and dividing that sum by the sum of
8 the total district enrollment for each of the fiscal years included in the calculation of the average.
9 In the event that enrollment in the regional district schools has not been accomplished by October
10 1 of any such year, construction and operating costs shall be apportioned on the basis of the
11 enrollment of pupils residing in each member town and receiving education at such town's expense
12 on October 1 of such year shall be used in the formula to calculate the apportionment.
13 SECTION 4. Section XI of Chapter 80 of the Public Laws of 1965, entitled "An Act
14 Approving and Ratifying the Agreement between the Towns of Exeter and West Greenwich, Rhode
15 Island, with Respect to the formation of a Regional School District," and the several amendments
16 to the same subsequent thereto, are hereby amended to read as follows:
17 Section XI. Amendments.
18 This agreement may be amended from time to time in the manner hereinafter provided, but
19 no amendment shall be made which shall impair the right of the holders of any bonds or notes or
20 other evidences of indebtedness of the regional school district then outstanding, or the rights of the
21 regional school district to procure the means for payment thereof, provided that nothing in this
22 section shall prevent the admission of a new town or towns to the regional school district and the
23 reapportionment accordingly of construction costs of the regional school district represented by
24 bonds or notes of the regional school district then outstanding and of the interest thereon.
25 A proposal for amendment may be initiated by a majority vote of all the members of the
26 regional district school committee or by a petition signed by 10% 5% of the registered voters of
27 any one of the member towns. In the latter case, the petition shall contain at the end thereof, a
28 certification by the clerk of the canvassing authority of such member town as to the number of
29 registered voters in said town, according to the most recent voting list, and the number of signatures
30 on the petition which appear to be the names of registered voters of said town.
31 In the event that an amendment is initiated by the school district, the regional district school
32 committee shall appoint a charter review subcommittee to review the charter and recommend
33 proposal(s) for amendment. The charter review subcommittee shall be comprised of at least two
34 (2) members of the regional district school committee (one member from Exeter and one member
LC002395 - Page 4 of 6
1 from West Greenwich), a member of each town council (one member from Exeter and one member
2 from West Greenwich), and two (2) citizens from each member town. In total, each member town
3 shall have equal representation on the charter review subcommittee. These defined members are
4 the only voting members of the charter review subcommittee. Only those proposals that come forth
5 from the charter review subcommittee, by majority vote of the subcommittee, are to be considered
6 by the regional district school committee for further action. Any regional district school committee
7 approved proposal(s) for amendment shall be presented to the clerk of the regional district school
8 committee, and the clerk or the clerk's designee shall mail or deliver a notice in writing to the town
9 council of each of the member towns that a proposal(s) to amend this agreement has/have been
10 received and shall enclose a copy of such proposal(s).
11 In the event of a proposed amendment by certified petition within a member town, the
12 proposed amendment must be presented first to both member town councils for review. Before any
13 further action may take place, both member town councils must approve the proposed amendment
14 contained within the certified petition. Should either member town council reject the proposed
15 amendment contained within the certified petition, the proposal is rejected and no further action is
16 to be taken. Should both member town councils approve the proposed amendment, or a revised
17 version thereof, a notice in writing must be mailed or delivered from both town councils, including
18 the proposed amendment, to the clerk of the regional district school committee (without the
19 signatures in the case of a proposal by petition).
20 The school committee shall schedule an all-day referendum to vote on the adoption of the
21 proposed amendment amendment(s). The town councils of the member towns shall thereupon meet
22 to provide for the all-day referendum in the member towns, with the approval of the proposed
23 amendment amendment(s) to be by majority vote of the combined total vote of the member towns.
24 SECTION 5. This act shall take effect upon passage.
