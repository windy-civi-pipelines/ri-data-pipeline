6 mental distress, incur economic loss or expense, property damage or any other compensable loss
7 as a result of conduct occurring on real property, except residences, with a written notice prohibiting
8 the possession of firearms, may recover his or her damages for the injury or death, physical,
9 emotional and/or mental distress, economic loss or expense, property damage or any other
10 compensable loss, in a civil action against the individual or entity that owns the real property that
11 prohibits the possession of firearms.
12 (b) The cause of action set forth in subsection (a) of this section shall extend to the conduct
13 of other invitees, trespassers, employees of the person or entity, vicious animals, wild animals, and
14 defensible man-made and natural hazards.
15 (c) The statute of limitations for the cause of action set forth in subsection (a) of this section
16 shall be three (3) years from the date of the occurrence of the conduct which gave rise to any
17 damages.
18 (d) To prevail in a cause of action brought under this section, the plaintiff must show by a

1 preponderance of the evidence that:
2 (1) The plaintiff owned a firearm, was authorized and licensed to carry a firearm or was
3 not prohibited from carrying a firearm at the time of the incident giving rise to the action;
4 (2) The plaintiff did not carry the firearm on the property where the incident occurred
5 because of the written notice prohibiting the possession of firearms;
6 (3) The injury, death, physical, emotional and/or mental distress, economic loss or expense,

8 the real property and could have been avoided if the plaintiff was authorized to carry his or her
9 firearm onto the real property; and
10 (4) The person or entity exercising control over the real property was not required by state
11 or federal law to post the notice prohibiting the possession of firearms, but posted the notice by
12 choice of that individual or entity.
13 SECTION 2. This act shall take effect upon passage.
