6 guidance or information used in effecting the services of diagnosis, maintenance, or repair of digital
7 electronic equipment.
8 (4) "Embedded software" means any programmable software instructions delivered with

15 of digital electronic equipment.
16 (6) "On fair and reasonable terms" means all of the following:
17 (i) At costs and terms that are equivalent to the most favorable costs and terms under which
18 an original equipment manufacturer offers to an authorized repair provider, accounting for any
19 discount, rebate, convenient and timely means of delivery, means of enabling fully restored and
20 updated functionality, rights of use, or other incentive and preference the original manufacturer
21 offers to an authorized repair provider, or any additional cost, burden, or impediment the original
22 equipment manufacturer imposes on an owner or independent repair provider.
23 (ii) With respect to documentation, made available by the original equipment manufacturer
24 at no charge, except that, when the documentation is requested in physical printed form, a charge
25 may be included for the reasonable actual costs of preparing and sending the copy.
26 (iii) With respect to tools, made available by the original equipment manufacturer:
27 (A) At no charge, except that, when a tool is requested in physical form, a charge may be
28 included for the reasonable, actual costs of preparing and sending the tool;
29 (B) Without requiring authorization or Internet access for the use or operation of these
30 tools, or imposing impediments to access or use of the tools to diagnose, maintain, or repair and
31 enable full functionality of digital electronic equipment; and
32 (C) Not in a manner that impairs the efficient and cost-effective performance of any
33 diagnosis, maintenance, or repair.
34 (iv) With respect to parts, made available by the original equipment manufacturer, either
LC000700 - Page 2 of 6
1 directly or through an authorized repair provider, in a manner that:
2 (A) Is not conditioned on or imposing a substantial obligation or restriction, including, but
3 not limited to, a minimum or reasonable maximum quantity of parts that owners and independent
4 repair providers can purchase, that is not reasonably necessary for enabling the owner or
5 independent repair provider to engage in the diagnosis, maintenance, or repair of digital electronic
6 equipment made by or on behalf of the original equipment manufacturer; and
7 (B) Does not condition access to parts on any additional contract other than a purchase
8 order.
9 (7) "Original equipment manufacturer" or "manufacturer" means a business engaged in the
10 business of selling, leasing, or otherwise supplying new digital electronic equipment manufactured
11 by or on behalf of itself, to any individual or business.

16 services of maintenance or repair of digital electronic equipment manufactured by or on behalf of,
17 sold or otherwise supplied by the original equipment manufacturer.
18 (10) "Parts pairing" refers to the practice by manufacturers of using software to identify
19 component parts through a unique identifier.
20 (11) "Tool" means any software program, hardware implement, or other apparatus used for
21 diagnosis, maintenance, or repair of digital electronic equipment, including software or other
22 mechanisms that provision, program, or pair a new part, calibrate functionality, or perform any
23 other function required to bring the product back to fully functional condition, including any
24 updates.
25 (12) "Trade secret" has the meaning given it in § 6-41-1.

31 required for the diagnosis, maintenance, or repair of such digital electronic equipment and parts for
32 this equipment, inclusive of any updates. The documentation, parts and tools shall be made
33 available either directly by such original equipment manufacturer or via an authorized repair
34 provider or distributor.
LC000700 - Page 3 of 6
1 (b) An original equipment manufacturer shall not use parts pairing or any other mechanism
2 to:
3 (1) Prevent the installation or functioning of any otherwise-functional part, including a
4 non-manufacturer approved replacement part or component;
5 (2) Inhibit or reduce the functioning of any part, such that replacement by an independent
6 repair provider or the device owner would cause the device to operate with reduced functionality
7 or performance;
8 (3) Create false, misleading, deceptive, or non-dismissible alerts or warnings about parts;
9 (4) Charge additional fees or increased prices for future repairs; or
10 (5) Limit who can purchase parts or perform repair services.
11 (c) For equipment that requires deactivating a lock for purposes of repair, the original
12 equipment manufacturer shall make available to any owner, or independent repair provider, with
13 the express permission of the owner, on fair and reasonable terms, any special documentation, tools,
14 and parts needed to access and reset the lock or function when disabled in the course of diagnosis,
15 maintenance, or repair of such equipment. This documentation, tools, and parts may be made
16 available through an appropriate secure release system.
17 6-61-4. Enforcement by attorney general.
18 If the attorney general determines that a failure to provide documentation, parts, or tools as
19 described in § 6-61-3 constitutes an unfair method of competition, false advertising, or unfair or
20 deceptive trade practices under chapter 13.1 of title 6, all remedies, penalties, and authority granted
21 to the attorney general by that chapter shall be available to the attorney general for the enforcement
22 of this chapter.
23 6-61-5. Limitations.

25 to divulge any trade secret to any owner or independent service provider, except as necessary to
26 perform diagnosis, maintenance, or repair on fair and reasonable terms.
27 (b) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to alter the terms of any arrangement
28 described in § 6-61-3(a) in force between an authorized repair provider and an original equipment
29 manufacturer, including, but not limited to, the performance or provision of warranty or recall
30 repair work by an authorized repair provider on behalf of an original equipment manufacturer and
31 pursuant to such arrangement, except that any provision in such terms that purports to waive, avoid,
32 restrict or limit the original equipment manufacturer's obligations to comply with this chapter shall
33 be void and unenforceable.
34 (c) No original equipment manufacturer or authorized repair provider shall be liable for
LC000700 - Page 4 of 6
1 any damage or injury to any digital electronic equipment caused by an independent repair provider
2 or owner which occurs during the course of repair, diagnosis, or maintenance and is not attributable
3 to the original equipment manufacturer or authorized repair provider other than if the failure is
4 attributable to design or manufacturing defects.
5 (d) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require a manufacturer to make available
6 special documentation, tools, and parts that would disable or override anti-theft security measures
7 set by the owner of the product without the owner's authorization.
8 (e) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require a manufacturer to sell a part if the
9 part is no longer available to the manufacturer.
