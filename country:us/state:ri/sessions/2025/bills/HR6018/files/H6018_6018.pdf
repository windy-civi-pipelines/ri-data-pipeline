Introduced By: Representatives Shallcross Smith, Boylan, Tanzi, Alzate, and Slater
Date Introduced: February 28, 2025
Referred To: House Finance
1 WHEREAS, The Gloria Gemma Breast Cancer Resource Foundation ("Gloria Gemma"),
2 an independent, 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, has served as a beacon of hope over the last
3 twenty-one years for people touched by cancer throughout Rhode Island and surrounding
4 communities; and
5 WHEREAS, According to the National Cancer Institute, 6,400 Rhode Islanders are
6 diagnosed with cancer annually or 6 percent of the population, and the World Population Review
7 ranks Rhode Island tenth out of fifty states for the highest incidence of all cancers combined; and
8 WHEREAS, The National Cancer Institute reported that "as of January 2022, it is
9 estimated that there are 18.1 million cancer survivors in the United States representing
10 approximately 5.4 percent of the population, projected to increase by 24.4 percent, to 22.5
11 million, by 2032"; and
12 WHEREAS, Gloria Gemma has earned a stellar reputation as a leader in cancer
13 rehabilitation and survivorship, which has captured the attention of national organizations; and
14 WHEREAS, Depression is a common comorbidity in cancer cases, affecting more than
15 10 percent of patients. A cancer diagnosis is life-changing and is a source of considerable
16 psychological and emotional stress, according to the National Institute of Health; and
17 WHEREAS, Affording mental health services becomes increasingly difficult for 25
18 percent to 50 percent of cancer patients who experience financial hardship; and
19 WHEREAS, Gloria Gemma's approach to emotional, physical, and spiritual healing is to
20 provide innovative programming delivered with compassionate care; and

1 WHEREAS, The Gloria Gemma Foundation provides free programs and services that
2 improve the mental, emotional and physical wellbeing of cancer patients in Rhode Island,
3 enabling them to return to work and live productive lives; and
4 WHEREAS, Gloria Gemma provides up-to-date cancer education to the community to
5 reduce their risks of developing cancer, and education to survivors to help them reduce their risks
6 of recurrence; and
7 WHEREAS, In early summer 2025, the Foundation will open a cancer survivorship and
8 wellbeing center open to people with all cancer types; and
9 WHEREAS, Evidence for integrative interventions in cancer care is growing, and
10 research supports the benefits of integrative interventions that the Foundation provides across the
11 cancer care continuum; and
12 WHEREAS, The organization believes that cancer survivorship should be accessible to
13 all, regardless of where people come from or who they are; and
14 WHEREAS, As there is no finite timeline on cancer survivorship, as it is a perpetual
15 process, the organization ensures all people can participate in the programs for as long as they
16 feel they need them; and
17 WHEREAS, Gloria Gemma is pushing the boundaries of traditional support and
18 providing creative programming that promotes healing of the whole person and generates social
19 networking opportunities for patients and survivors to connect with one another; now, therefore
20 be it
21 RESOLVED, That there is hereby appropriated, out of any money in the treasury not
22 otherwise appropriated for the fiscal year 2025-2026, the sum of five hundred thousand dollars
23 ($500,000) to provide operational support for the Gloria Gemma Foundation and the
24 organization’s cancer survivorship and wellbeing center; and the state controller is hereby
25 authorized and directed to draw their orders upon the general treasurer for payment of said sum,
26 or so much thereof as may be from time required, upon receipt of properly authenticated
27 vouchers.
