23 Providence middle schools; and

27 and in his position as the Superintendent of Public Schools in North Providence; and
28 WHEREAS, The Rhode Island School Superintendents Association "Superintendent of
29 the Year" Award annually "recognizes outstanding achievement in school district leadership,
30 dedication to the education of all children, commitment to the community, and service to the
