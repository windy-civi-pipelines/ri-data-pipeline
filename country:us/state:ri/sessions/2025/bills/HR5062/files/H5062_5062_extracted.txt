Date Introduced: January 15, 2025
Referred To: House read and passed
1 WHEREAS, This House was deeply saddened to hear of the passing of the Honorable
2 John E. Faria, the beloved husband of Patricia Pastore, OCDS, for sixty-three years, and the
3 devoted father of Kimberly, Jeffrey and his wife, Dede, and Johnathan and his wife, Tracey. He
4 was also the very proud grandfather of Kyle and his wife, Kim, Jared, Tyler and Kaia, and one
5 great-grandchild, Alaina; and
6 WHEREAS, Mr. Faria was born and remained a lifelong resident of the Town of Bristol.
7 He was the son of the late John P. and Edwina Faria, who had been Portuguese immigrants, and
8 the brother of the late Adam Faria. He was a graduate of Colt Memorial High School, and soon
9 thereafter, joined the United States Navy, serving with honor as a Gunners Mate Second Class
10 and for three years on the Intrepid in the Mediterranean Sea; and
11 WHEREAS, A life-long Democrat, the Honorable John Faria was a member and later
12 Chairman of the Bristol Democratic Town Committee for nineteen years. He was also elected as
13 a member and ultimately served as President of the Bristol Town Council from 1968 thru 1971,
14 and in a special election on November 2, 1971, was elected to the District 45 seat of the Rhode
15 Island Senate, serving constituency in the Towns of Warren and Bristol until January of 1973;
16 and
17 WHEREAS, Later in the 1970s, Mr. Faria attended Roger Williams College, graduating
18 with a Bachelor’s degree in accounting, and for nineteen years, worked for the RI Department of
19 Administration. In addition, for more than forty years during the tax season, he had diligently
1 spent countless long evenings preparing the income taxes for more than five hundred families;
2 and
3 WHEREAS, Devoted to his community in myriad ways, Mr. Faria served and was a

6 Columbus, Co-Chairman of Bristol’s Tricentennial Celebration, and for the last twenty-seven
7 years, as a member and later as Chairman of the Bristol Housing Authority; and
8 WHEREAS, Proud of his heritage, Mr. Faria served the Social Security Administration
9 of the US Department of Health, Education and Welfare as a citizenship instructor for immigrants
10 wishing to become United States citizens. He earned both the respect and gratitude of many
11 generations for his assistance in becoming Americans and had whole-heartedly stated that “We
12 were all immigrants at one time in this country and it is immigrants who have made America
13 what it is today, and it distresses me to see how immigrants are now being treated, no matter their
14 country of origin”; and
15 WHEREAS, The Honorable John Faria led a life replete with accolades,
16 accomplishments and admiration. He was a devoted family man, a dedicated representative for
17 his community and our State, and a widely-respected gentleman, who annually hosted State and
18 local Governors, Senators, Congressmen and local officials on his family’s homestead, located at
19 the starting point of Bristol’s historic 4th of July Parade route, and he is deeply missed by all who
20 had been fortunate to have been part of his glorious life; now, therefore be it
21 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
22 extends deepest condolences and sympathy on the passing of the Honorable John E. Faria; and be
23 it further
24 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
25 transmit a duly certified copy of this resolution to Patricia Pastore, OCDS and Family.
