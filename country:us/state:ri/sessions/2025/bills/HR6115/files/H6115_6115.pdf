Date Introduced: March 20, 2025
Referred To: House read and passed
1 WHEREAS, Alzheimer's disease is a degenerative brain disease, and the most common
2 form of dementia that results in loss of memory and other cognitive function, and eventually
3 death; and
4 WHEREAS, Alzheimer's disease is the seventh leading cause of death in the United
5 States and the fifth leading cause of death for persons aged 65 and over; and
6 WHEREAS, It is estimated that one in three seniors dies from Alzheimer's disease or
7 another dementia, more than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined; and
8 WHEREAS, An estimated 7 million people in the United States are living with
9 Alzheimer's disease, and this number is anticipated to increase to 12.7 million by 2050; and
10 WHEREAS, The direct costs to the United States caring for individuals living with
11 Alzheimer's disease in 2024 was estimated to be $360 billion, increasing to nearly $1 trillion by
12 2050, making it the most expensive disease in America; and
13 WHEREAS, More than 24,000 Rhode Islanders are living with Alzheimer's disease, and
14 an estimated 36,000 family caregivers provide approximately 51 million hours of unpaid care
15 valued at more than $1.1 billion; and
16 WHEREAS, Alzheimer's disease is the fifth leading cause of death in Rhode Island for
17 persons 65 years of age or older; and
18 WHEREAS, Older Black Americans face nearly 2 times, and Latino Americans face
19 nearly 1.5 times higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease; and

1 WHEREAS, Rhode Island's per capita Medicare spending on people with dementia is
2 $30,782, and Rhode Island's Medicaid costs of caring for people with Alzheimer's disease is
3 nearly $500 million; and
4 WHEREAS, Caregiving for individuals with Alzheimer's disease often takes an
5 enormous toll on family members; caregivers themselves often suffer more stress, depression, and
6 health problems than caregivers of people with other illnesses; and
7 WHEREAS, An increasing number of individuals are developing younger-onset
8 Alzheimer's disease, a form of the disease that occurs prior to age 65 and can be particularly
9 difficult on family dynamics and economics due to its early occurrence; and
10 WHEREAS, As the population of older adults in Rhode Island continues to grow, there
11 will be an increased demand for residential, home-based, and community-based services that will
12 in turn mean an increased demand for direct care workers, including home health aides, certified
13 nursing assistants, and personal care aides; and
14 WHEREAS, Advocates are visiting the State House today, to raise awareness and inform
15 legislators of the challenges they face navigating Alzheimer's and all other dementias; now,
16 therefore be it
17 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
18 proclaims March 20, 2025, as "Alzheimer's Awareness Day" in the State of Rhode Island; and be
19 it further
20 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
21 transmit a duly certified copy of this resolution to Donna McGowan, Executive Director,
22 Alzheimer's Association, Rhode Island Chapter.
