10 These coverage changes must be approved by the insurance division with respect to those
11 types of insurance defined in § 27-8-1(1) — (8), issued to non-business insured and bodily injury
12 and property damage liability coverage issued to non-business insured. There shall be no liability
13 on the part of, and no cause of action of any nature shall arise against, the commissioner of
14 insurance or any insurer, their authorized representatives, agents, or employees, or any firm, person,
15 or corporation furnishing to the insurer or commissioner information as to the reasons for
16 cancellation or nonrenewal; for any statement made by any of them in any written notice of
17 cancellation or nonrenewal; or in any other communication, oral or written, specifying the reasons
18 for cancellation or nonrenewal; or for the providing of information pertaining to the cancellation
19 or nonrenewal; or for statements made, or evidence submitted, at any hearing conducted in
20 connection with the cancellation or nonrenewal.
21 (b) The commissioner shall promulgate regulations with respect to personal motor vehicle
22 insurance, homeowners insurance, and residential fire insurance, or any components of that
23 insurance requiring notification to policyholders upon renewal of any coverage reductions,
24 elimination, or increased deductibles not at the request of the insured.
25 (c) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, on and after September 1, 2025, any increase
26 of more than twenty percent (20%) in the cost of renewal of homeowner’s insurance shall require
27 two (2) months’ advance notice be provided by the insurer to the policyholder. If an insurer is
28 failing to renew a homeowner’s policy, the notice of non-renewal shall be delivered to the
29 policyholder no less than two (2) months in advance of the policy expiration.
30 (d) On and after September 1 2025, annual home owner policy renewal premium increases
31 shall be capped at a maximum of five (5%) percent for any policyholder who is sixty-five (65)
32 years of age or older and has household income equal to or less than the Rhode Island income limits
33 for low- and moderate-income households as published by RI Housing.
34 (e) Any violation of the provisions of this section shall constitute a deceptive trade practice
