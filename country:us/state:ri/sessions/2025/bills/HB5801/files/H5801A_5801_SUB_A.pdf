7 throughout the development; are compatible in scale and , meaning that: (1) The size of the low-
8 and moderate-income units shall not be less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the size of the

19 restricted, and neither age-restricted housing units nor any building or phase containing age-
20 restricted housing units must be compatible in scale and architectural style to other housing unit
21 types to the extent the age-restricted housing units are designed to meet the physical or social needs
22 of older persons or necessary to provide housing opportunities for older persons.
23 (IV) There Whether there will be no significant negative impacts on the health and safety
24 of current or future residents of the community, in areas including, but not limited to, safe
25 circulation of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, provision of emergency services, sewerage disposal,
26 availability of potable water, adequate surface water run-off, and the preservation of natural,
27 historical, or cultural features that contribute to the attractiveness of the community.
28 (V) All Whether the proposed land developments and all or subdivisions lots will have
29 adequate and permanent physical access to a public street in accordance with the requirements of
30 § 45-23-60(a)(5), or the local review board has approved other access, such as a private road.
31 (VI) The Whether the proposed development will not result in the creation of individual

33 regulations and building standards would be impracticable, unless created only as permanent open
34 space or permanently reserved for a public purpose on the approved, recorded plans.

10 (i) Submission requirements. Applications for preliminary plan review under this chapter
11 shall include:
12 (A) A letter of eligibility issued by the Rhode Island housing and mortgage finance
13 corporation, or in the case of projects primarily funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and
14 Urban Development or other state or federal agencies, an award letter indicating the subsidy, or
15 application in such form as may be prescribed for a municipal government subsidy; and
16 (B) A letter signed by the authorized representative of the applicant, setting forth the
17 specific sections and provisions of applicable local ordinances and regulations from which the
18 applicant is seeking adjustments; and
19 (C) A proposed timetable for the commencement of construction and completion of the
20 project; and
21 (D) Those items required by local regulations promulgated pursuant to applicable state law,
22 with the exception of evidence of state or federal permits; and for comprehensive permit
23 applications included in the checklist for the preliminary plan review in the local regulations
24 promulgated pursuant to chapter 23 of this title; and
25 (E) Notwithstanding the submission requirements set forth above, the local review board
26 may request additional, reasonable documentation throughout the public hearing, including, but not
27 limited to, opinions of experts, credible evidence of application for necessary federal and/or state
28 permits, statements and advice from other local boards and officials.
29 (ii) Certification of completeness. The preliminary plan application must be certified
30 complete or incomplete by the administrative officer according to the provisions of § 45-23-36;
31 provided, however, that the certificate shall be granted within twenty-five (25) days of submission
32 of the application. The running of the time period set forth herein will be deemed stopped upon the
33 issuance of a written certificate of incompleteness of the application by the administrative officer
34 and will recommence upon the resubmission of a corrected application by the applicant. However,
LC002161/SUB A - Page 22 of 30

1 in no event will the administrative officer be required to certify a corrected submission as complete
2 or incomplete less than ten (10) days after its resubmission. If the administrative officer certifies
3 the application as incomplete, the officer shall set forth in writing with specificity the missing or
4 incomplete items.
5 (iii) Review of applications. An application filed in accordance with this chapter shall be
6 reviewed in accordance with the following provisions:
7 (A) Public hearing. A public hearing shall be noticed and held as soon as practicable after
8 the issuance of a certificate of completeness.
9 (B) Notice. Public notice for the public hearing will be the same notice required under local
10 regulations for a public hearing for a preliminary plan promulgated in accordance with § 45-23-42.
11 The cost of notice shall be paid by the applicant.
12 (C) Timeframe for review. The local review board shall render a decision on the
13 preliminary plan application within ninety (90) days of the date the application is certified
14 complete, or within a further amount of time that may be consented to by the applicant through the
15 submission of a written consent.
16 (D) Failure to act. Failure of the local review board to act within the prescribed period
17 constitutes approval of the preliminary plan, and a certificate of the administrative officer as to the
18 failure of the local review board to act within the required time and the resulting approval shall be
19 issued on request of the applicant. Further, if the public hearing is not convened or a decision is not
20 rendered within the time allowed in subsections (d)(2)(iii)(A) and (d)(2)(iii)(C) of this section, the
21 application is deemed to have been allowed and the preliminary plan approval shall be issued
22 immediately.
23 (E) Required findings for approval. In approving an application, the local review board
24 shall make positive findings, supported by legally competent evidence on the record that discloses
25 the nature and character of the observations upon which the fact finders acted, on each of the
26 following standard provisions, where applicable:
27 (I) The proposed development is consistent with local needs as identified in the local
28 comprehensive community plan with particular emphasis on the community’s affordable housing
29 plan and/or has satisfactorily addressed the issues where there may be inconsistencies.
30 (II) The proposed development is in compliance with the standards and provisions of the
31 municipality’s zoning ordinance and subdivision regulations, and/or where adjustments are
32 requested by the applicant, that local concerns that have been affected by the relief granted do not
33 outweigh the state and local need for low- and moderate-income housing. For cities and towns that
34 have low- or moderate-income housing in excess of ten percent (10%) of its year-round housing
LC002161/SUB A - Page 23 of 30

1 units, where adjustments are requested, in addition to the above-showing, the proposed
2 development must show it has mitigated any impact of the proposed development on the general
3 character of the surrounding area.
4 (III) All low- and moderate-income housing units proposed are integrated throughout the
5 development; are compatible in scale and architectural style to the market rate units within the
6 project; and will be built and occupied prior to, or simultaneous with the construction and
7 occupancy of any market rate units.
8 (IV) There will be no significant negative impacts on the health and safety of current or
9 future residents of the community, in areas including, but not limited to, safe circulation of
10 pedestrian and vehicular traffic, provision of emergency services, sewerage disposal, availability
11 of potable water, adequate surface water run-off, and the preservation of natural, historical, or
12 cultural features that contribute to the attractiveness of the community.
13 (V) All proposed land developments and all subdivisions lots will have adequate and
14 permanent physical access to a public street in accordance with the requirements of § 45-23-
15 60(a)(5).
16 (VI) The proposed development will not result in the creation of individual lots with any
17 physical constraints to development that building on those lots according to pertinent regulations
18 and building standards would be impracticable, unless created only as permanent open space or
19 permanently reserved for a public purpose on the approved, recorded plans.
20 (F) Required findings for denial. In reviewing the comprehensive permit request, the
21 local review board may deny the request for any of the following reasons: (I) If the city or town
22 has an approved affordable housing plan and is meeting housing needs, and the proposal is
23 inconsistent with the affordable housing plan; provided that, the local review board also finds that
24 the municipality has made significant progress in implementing that housing plan; (II) The proposal
25 is not consistent with local needs, including, but not limited to, the needs identified in an approved
26 comprehensive plan, and/or local zoning ordinances and procedures promulgated in conformance
27 with the comprehensive plan; (III) The proposal is not in conformance with the comprehensive
28 plan; (IV) The community has met or has plans to meet the goal of ten percent (10%) of the year-
29 round units or, in the case of an urban town or city, fifteen percent (15%) of the occupied rental
30 housing units as defined in § 45-53-3(5)(i) being low- and moderate-income housing; provided
31 that, the local review board also finds that the community has achieved or has made significant
32 progress towards meeting the goals required by this section; or (V) Concerns for the environment
33 and the health and safety of current residents have not been adequately addressed.
34 (iv) Vesting. The approved preliminary plan is vested for a period of two (2) years with
LC002161/SUB A - Page 24 of 30

1 the right to extend for two (2), one-year extensions upon written request by the applicant, who must
2 appear before the planning board for each annual review and provide proof of valid state or federal
3 permits as applicable. Thereafter, vesting may be extended for a longer period, for good cause
4 shown, if requested, in writing by the applicant, and approved by the local review board. The
5 vesting for the preliminary plan approval includes all ordinance provisions and regulations at the
6 time of the approval, general and specific conditions shown on the approved preliminary plan
7 drawings and supporting material.
8 (3) Final plan review. The second and final stage of review for the comprehensive permit
9 project shall be done administratively, unless an applicant has requested and been granted any
10 waivers from the submission of checklist items for preliminary plan review, and then, at the local
11 review board’s discretion, it may vote to require the applicant to return for final plan review and
12 approval.
13 (i) Submission requirements. Applications for final plan review under this chapter shall
14 include:
15 (A) All required state and federal permits must be obtained prior to the final plan approval
16 or the issuance of a building permit; and
17 (B) A draft monitoring agreement which identifies an approved entity that will monitor the
18 long-term affordability of the low- and moderate-income units pursuant to § 45-53-3.2; and
19 (C) A sample land lease or deed restriction with affordability liens that will restrict use as
20 low- and moderate-income housing in conformance with the guidelines of the agency providing
21 the subsidy for the low- and moderate-income housing, but for a period of not less than thirty (30)
22 years; and
23 (D) Those items required by local regulations promulgated pursuant to applicable state law
24 included in the checklist for final plan review in the local regulations promulgated pursuant to
25 chapter 23 of this title, including, but not limited to:
26 (I) Arrangements for completion of the required public improvements, including
27 construction schedule and/or financial guarantees; and
28 (II) Certification by the tax collector that all property taxes are current; and
29 (III) For phased projects, the final plan for phases following the first phase, shall be
30 accompanied by copies of as-built drawings not previously submitted of all existing public
31 improvements for prior phases.
32 (ii) Certification of completeness. The final plan application must be certified complete
33 or incomplete by the administrative officer according to the provisions of § 45-23-36; provided
34 however, that the certificate shall be granted within twenty-five (25) days of submission of the
LC002161/SUB A - Page 25 of 30

1 application. The running of the time period set forth herein will be deemed stopped upon the
2 issuance of a written certificate of incompleteness of the application by the administrative officer
3 and will recommence upon the resubmission of a corrected application by the applicant. However,
4 in no event will the administrative officer be required to certify a corrected submission as complete
5 or incomplete less than ten (10) days after its resubmission. If the administrative officer certifies
6 the application as incomplete, the officer shall set forth in writing with specificity the missing or
7 incomplete items.
8 (iii) Review of applications.
9 (A) Timeframe for review. The reviewing authority shall render a decision on the final
10 plan application within forty-five (45) days of the date the application is certified complete.
11 (B) Modifications and changes to plans:
12 (I) Minor changes, as defined in the local regulations, to the plans approved at preliminary
13 plan may be approved administratively, by the administrative officer, whereupon final plan
14 approval may be issued. The changes may be authorized without additional public hearings, at the
15 discretion of the administrative officer. All changes shall be made part of the permanent record of
16 the project application. This provision does not prohibit the administrative officer from requesting
17 a recommendation from either the technical review committee or the local review board. Denial of
18 the proposed change(s) shall be referred to the local review board for review as a major change.
19 (II) Major changes, as defined in the local regulations, to the plans approved at preliminary
20 plan may be approved only by the local review board and must follow the same review and public
21 hearing process required for approval of preliminary plans as described in subsection (d)(2)(iii) of
22 this section.
23 (III) The administrative officer shall notify the applicant in writing within fourteen (14)
24 days of submission of the final plan application if the administrative officer is referring the
25 application to the local review board under this subsection.
26 (C) Decision on final plan. An application filed in accordance with this chapter shall be
27 approved by the administrative officer unless such application does not satisfy conditions set forth
28 in the preliminary plan approval decision or such application does not have the requisite state and/or
29 federal approvals or other required submissions, does not post the required improvement bonds, or
30 such application is a major modification of the plans approved at preliminary plan.
31 (D) Failure to act. Failure of the reviewing authority to act within the prescribed period
32 constitutes approval of the final plan, and a certificate of the administrative officer as to the failure
33 to act within the required time and the resulting approval shall be issued on request of the applicant.
34 (iv) Vesting. The approved final plan is vested for a period of two (2) years with the right
LC002161/SUB A - Page 26 of 30

1 to extend for one one-year extension upon written request by the applicant, who must appear before
2 the planning board for the extension request. Thereafter, vesting may be extended for a longer
3 period, for good cause shown, if requested, in writing by the applicant, and approved by the local
4 review board.
5 (4) Infeasibility of conditions of approval. The burden is on the applicant to show, by
6 competent evidence before the local review board, that proposed conditions of approval are
7 infeasible, as defined in § 45-53-3. Upon request, the applicant shall be provided a reasonable
8 opportunity to respond to such proposed conditions prior to a final vote on the application.
9 (5) Fees. Municipalities may impose fees on comprehensive permit applications that are
10 consistent with but do not exceed fees that would otherwise be assessed for a project of the same
11 scope and type, but not proceeding under this chapter; provided, however, the imposition of such
12 fees shall not preclude a showing by an applicant that the fees make the project financially
13 infeasible.
14 (6) Recording of written decisions. All written decisions on applications under this
15 chapter shall be recorded in the land evidence records within twenty (20) days after the local review
16 board’s vote or the administrative officer’s decision, as applicable. A copy of the recorded decision
17 shall be mailed within one business day of recording, by any method that provides confirmation of
18 receipt, to the applicant and to any objector who has filed a written request for notice with the
19 administrative officer.
20 (7) Local review board powers. The local review board has the same power to issue
21 permits or approvals that any local board or official who would otherwise act with respect to the
22 application, including, but not limited to, the power to attach to the permit or approval, conditions,
23 and requirements with respect to height, site plan, size or shape, or building materials, as are
24 consistent with the terms of this section.
25 (8) Majority vote required. All local review board decisions on comprehensive permits
26 shall be by majority vote of the members present at the proceeding.
27 (9) Construction timetable. A comprehensive permit shall expire unless construction is
28 started within twelve (12) months and completed within sixty (60) months of the recording of the
29 final plan unless a longer and/or phased period for development is agreed to by the local review
30 board and the applicant. Low- and moderate-income housing units shall be built and occupied prior
31 to, or simultaneous with the construction and occupancy of market rate units.
32 (10) For-profit developers — Limits. A town with an approved affordable housing plan
33 and that is meeting local housing needs, as defined in this chapter, may by council action limit the
34 annual total number of dwelling units in comprehensive permit applications from for-profit
LC002161/SUB A - Page 27 of 30

1 developers to an aggregate of one percent (1%) of the total number of year-round housing units in
2 the town, as recognized in the affordable housing plan and notwithstanding the timetables set forth
3 elsewhere in this section, the local review board shall have the authority to consider comprehensive
4 permit applications from for-profit developers, which are made pursuant to this paragraph,
5 sequentially in the order in which they are submitted.
6 (11)(10) Report. The local review board of a town with an approved affordable housing
7 plan shall report the status of implementation to the housing resources commission, including the
8 disposition of any applications made under the plan, as of June 30, 2006, by September 1, 2006,
9 and for each June 30 thereafter by September 1 through 2010. The housing resources commission
10 shall prepare by October 15 and adopt by December 31, a report on the status of implementation,
11 which shall be submitted to the governor, the speaker and the president of the senate, and shall find
12 which towns are not in compliance with implementation requirements.
13 (12)(11) Remanded applications. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 45-53-4 in effect
14 on February 13, 2004, a local review board shall commence hearings within thirty (30) days of
15 receiving an application remanded pursuant to § 45-53-5 or, effective January 1, 2024, § 45-53-
16 5.1. In any town with more than one remanded application, applications may be scheduled for
17 hearing in the order in which they were received, and may be taken up sequentially, with the thirty-
18 day (30) requirement for the initiation of hearings, commencing upon the decision of the earlier
19 filed application.
20 (e)(1) The general assembly finds and declares that in January 2004 towns throughout
21 Rhode Island have been confronted by an unprecedented volume and complexity of development
22 applications as a result of private for-profit developers using the provisions of this chapter and that
23 in order to protect the public health and welfare in communities and to provide sufficient time to
24 establish a reasonable and orderly process for the consideration of applications made under the
25 provisions of this chapter, and to have communities prepare plans to meet low- and moderate-
26 income housing goals, that it is necessary to impose a moratorium on the use of comprehensive
27 permit applications as herein provided by private for-profit developers; a moratorium is hereby
28 imposed on the use of the provisions of this chapter by private for-profit developers, which
29 moratorium shall be effective on passage and shall expire on January 31, 2005, and may be revisited
30 prior to expiration and extended to such other date as may be established by law. Notwithstanding
31 the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, private for-profit developers may not utilize the
32 procedure of this chapter until the expiration of the moratorium.
33 (2) No for-profit developer shall submit a new application for comprehensive permits until
34 July 1, 2005, except by mutual agreement with the local review board.
LC002161/SUB A - Page 28 of 30

1 (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (e)(2) of this section, a local review board
2 in a town which has submitted a plan in accordance with subsection (f) of this section, shall not be
3 required to accept an application for a new comprehensive permit from a for-profit developer until
4 October 1, 2005.
5 (f) Towns and cities that are not in conformity with the provisions of § 45-53-3(5)(i) shall
6 prepare by December 31, 2004, a comprehensive plan housing element for low- and moderate-
7 income housing as specified by § 45-53-3(5)(ii), consistent with applicable law and regulation.
8 That the secretary of the planning board or commission of each city or town subject to the
9 requirements of this paragraph shall report in writing the status of the preparation of the housing
10 element for low- and moderate-income housing on or before June 30, 2004, and on or before
11 December 31, 2004, to the secretary of the state planning council, to the chair of the house
12 committee on corporations and to the chair of the senate committee on commerce, housing and
13 municipal government.
14 (g) If any provision of this section or the application thereof shall for any reason be judged
15 invalid, the judgment shall not affect, impair, or invalidate the remainder of this section or of any
16 other provision of this chapter, but shall be confined in its effect to the provision or application
17 directly involved in the controversy giving rise to the judgment, and a moratorium on the
18 applications of for-profit developers pursuant to this chapter shall remain and continue to be in
19 effect for the period commencing on the day this section becomes law [February 13, 2004] and
20 continue until it shall expire on January 31, 2005, or until amended further.
21 (h) In planning for, awarding, and otherwise administering programs and funds for housing
22 and for community development, state departments, agencies, boards and commissions, and public
23 corporations, as defined in chapter 18 of title 35, shall among the towns subject to the provision of
24 § 45-53-3(5)(ii), give priority to the maximum extent allowable by law to towns with an approved
25 affordable housing plan. The director of administration shall adopt not later than January 31, 2005,
26 regulations to implement the provisions of this section.
27 (i) Multi-family rental units built under a comprehensive permit may be calculated towards
28 meeting the requirements of a municipality’s low- or moderate-income housing inventory, as long
29 as the units meet and are in compliance with the provisions of § 45-53-3.1.
30 SECTION 3. Section 1 of this act shall take effect upon passage and section 2 of this act
31 shall take effect on January 1, 2026.
