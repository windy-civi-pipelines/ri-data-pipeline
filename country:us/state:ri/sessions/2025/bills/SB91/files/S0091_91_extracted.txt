Introduced By: Senators Kallman, Sosnowski, DiMario, Euer, Lawson, Britto, Gu, Gallo,
McKenney, and Valverde
Date Introduced: January 31, 2025
Referred To: Senate Environment & Agriculture
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Findings and purpose.
2 The purpose of this chapter is to understand and reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of
3 buildings in Rhode Island, consistent with an Act on Climate, chapter 6.2-9 of title 42. Of the
4 building stock in 2050, approximately seventy percent (70%) has already been built, and addressing
5 these existing buildings is critical to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. While significant
6 retrofits to existing buildings will eventually be needed, this chapter establishes a program for the
7 energy benchmarking of large buildings in Rhode Island and a standard for their energy
8 performance and requires that the construction or alteration of new buildings be electric-ready.
9 Further, the intent of the legislature is to ensure that the Executive Climate Change Coordinating
10 Council (EC4) has dedicated resources sufficient to administer its responsibilities under this chapter
11 to enable swift and steady progress towards Rhode Island's net-zero mandate.
12 SECTION 2. Title 23 of the General Laws entitled "HEALTH AND SAFETY" is hereby
13 amended by adding thereto the following chapter:

3 and may partner with nonprofit organizations and associations to make such an application if
4 beneficial.
5 (f) In administering this section, the EC4 may:
6 (1) Designate subcategories of buildings based on common characteristics such as building
7 use, and may establish different reporting requirements for subcategories; and
8 (2) Consider whether tenant-occupied units or spaces are separately metered and may
9 address such conditions in any forms, instructions, or responses to questions.
10 (g) The EC4 shall provide to owners instructions regarding tenant energy consumption
11 data, including best practices for lease provisions and for estimates where obtaining metered data
12 is not practicable.
13 (h) Not later than the deadlines provided in subsections (k)(1) through (k)(3) of this section,
14 beginning in the year indicated, the owner of each covered property shall submit to the EC4 energy
15 use information for each covered property. Such submission shall include additional required
16 information, if any, identified by the EC4 and shall be in the form and manner, if any, prescribed
17 by the EC4. The failure of the EC4 to issue guidance shall not excuse owners of this obligation.
18 (i) When an owner submits required information accompanied by evidence of data
19 verification by a third party per regulations issued pursuant to this section, the owner shall have an
20 additional three (3) months beyond the dates indicated in subsection (k)(2) of this section to report.

3 than one hundred thousand (100,000) customers shall make available to owners of covered
4 properties anonymized and aggregated usage data for owner's covered property for the purpose of
5 compliance with this chapter. By nature of being aggregated, the intent is to anonymize individual
6 tenant energy use information, and not disclose this or any other personal information related to
7 tenant customers or their accounts.
8 (m) To the extent that gas and electric companies incur new or additional expenses to
9 collect, aggregate, organize, or provide energy use information under this chapter, prior to filing
10 for cost recovery, shall first demonstrate good faith efforts to secure federal, state, or other relevant
11 funding options. Thereafter, such additional expenses shall be eligible for cost recovery through
12 rates charged to customers under the appropriate cost recovery mechanisms as determined by the
13 public utilities commission.
14 (n) Electric and gas distribution utilities shall collaborate with the EC4 to identify best
15 practices for collecting and managing aggregated whole building data.
16 (o) The EC4 shall endeavor to ensure that electric and gas distribution companies or other
17 energy efficiency program administrator provide owners of buildings subject to this section with
18 up-to-date information about energy efficiency opportunities or actions available to increase energy
19 efficiency, including incentives in utility-administered or other energy efficiency programs and
20 changes in energy assessment technology.
21 23-27.5-5. Municipal implementation of building energy benchmarking
22 requirements.
23 (a) The EC4 shall establish procedures, including a process and conditions, for a
24 municipality to apply to the EC4 for the right to implement, in place of the EC4, the building energy
25 benchmarking requirements. Such conditions shall include, at a minimum, acceptance of
26 responsibility to collect the information specified by the EC4 from the covered property owners on
27 the schedule specified by the EC4, and the provision of benchmarking data to the EC4 annually.
28 (b) The EC4 shall review any application from a municipality to implement the building
29 energy benchmarking requirements and the EC4 may deny a request if it is not satisfied that the
30 conditions in subsection (a) of this section are met. A denial shall include a finding of facts and
31 final determination that the municipal plan does not meet the requirements of this section.
32 (c) A municipality that is approved to implement the building energy benchmarking
33 requirements shall be authorized to assess any fines related to the program as provided in the
34 approval by the EC4. Funds collected by a municipality shall be retained by the municipality.
LC000179 - Page 8 of 16
1 (d) The EC4 shall evaluate any municipal programs established under this subsection at
2 least once every five (5) years and may withdraw its approval if municipal programs fail to comply
3 with those conditions.
4 (e) In the case of a municipality that has initiated a building energy benchmarking
5 requirement prior to the enactment of this law, the municipality may continue such program in lieu
6 of the benchmarking requirements to be established by the EC4. In such case, the municipality must
7 notify the EC4 of such intent within one hundred eighty (180) days of the enactment of this chapter
8 and must provide benchmarking data to the EC4 annually thereafter.
9 23-27.5-6. Building performance improvement.
10 (a) On a regular basis, the EC4 shall evaluate data relevant to understanding the energy use
11 and greenhouse gas emissions of buildings in Rhode Island, including, but not limited, to the
12 benchmarking data collected under this chapter. The EC4 shall publish reports summarizing the
13 data and the status of building emissions in Rhode Island biennially. Beginning no later than August
14 31, 2029, and annually thereafter, the EC4 shall post benchmarking data for the prior calendar year.
15 Such posted benchmarking data shall include, at a minimum, for each covered property required to
16 submit energy use information for the given calendar year, the address of the covered property and
17 its energy performance rating or assessment score.
18 (b) No later than August 31, 2029, the EC4 shall publish a report including a summary of
19 its activities and progress under this chapter and detailing recommended measures, policies and
20 programs to achieve building emission reductions aligned with Rhode Island's net zero goal. The
21 EC4 shall issue supplemental reports biennially for a period of twenty (20) years.
22 (c) Performance metrics shall include site energy use intensity and may also include
23 greenhouse gas emissions or other metrics relevant to the purpose of this chapter.
24 (d) No later than June 30, 2030, the EC4 shall select performance metrics and set a building
25 performance standard for each property type or subcategory.
26 (e) The EC4 shall set final building performance standards that shall collectively cause the
27 aggregate greenhouse gas emissions attributable to all covered properties to be reduced in line with
28 reaching net zero by 2050.
29 (f) The EC4 shall set interim building performance standards for covered properties that
30 are applicable at the end of each five (5) year period between adoption and 2050. In doing so the
31 EC4 may use a straight-line trajectory, from the covered property's baseline performance for each
32 performance metric to the final building performance standard for that performance metric such
33 that each calculated performance metric shall improve in equal increments during each five (5) year
34 period. The EC4 may use other means to calculate interim building performance standards if it
LC000179 - Page 9 of 16
1 deems the straight-line trajectory approach ill-suited for a covered property type.
2 (g) As of June 30, 2035, and at the end of every five (5) year period thereafter, the owner
3 of a covered property shall demonstrate progress toward each applicable final building performance
4 standard by achieving the interim building performance standard(s) set by the EC4 for the covered
5 property.
6 (h) If the owner of a covered property believes that the owner cannot reasonably meet one
7 or more of the applicable interim or final building performance standards, then the owner may
8 propose an alternative building performance action plan to the EC4. If the EC4 approves an
9 alternative building performance action plan for a covered property, then the owner shall be
10 responsible only to comply with the provisions of the alternative building performance action plan
11 until the next compliance date.
12 (i) The EC4 shall issue forms, guidance and promulgate regulations necessary to implement
13 this section including requirements for building performance action plans.
14 (j) In consultation with the EJAB, the EC4 shall provide technical assistance for owners
15 lacking the financial, operational, or technical capacity to meet interim or final building
16 performance standards. To the extent possible, such assistance shall include information on
17 potential loan, grant, and other financing options for owners.
18 (k) The EC4 shall coordinate with utility companies, energy efficiency program
19 administrators, the public utilities commission, state agencies, and local governments, as
20 appropriate, to support the implementation of its recommendations pursuant to this section.
21 (l) In the case of a municipality that has initiated a building energy performance
22 requirement prior to the enactment of this law, the municipality may continue such program in lieu
23 of the requirements to be established by the EC4 under this section. In such case, the municipality
24 must notify the EC4 of such intent within one hundred eighty (180) days of the enactment of this
25 chapter and must provide program and performance information to the EC4 annually thereafter.
26 23-27.5-7. Compliance assurance.
27 (a) The EC4 shall establish a program to maximize owner compliance with this chapter.
28 The EC4 shall issue forms, guidance and promulgate regulations as necessary to implement the
29 compliance program, and shall revise such forms, guidance and regulations from time to time as
30 needed.
31 (b) The EC4 may grant an extension, adjustment or exemption to an interim or final
32 building performance standards for a covered property whose owner submits a request, together
33 with documentation, in a form and date prescribed by the EC4, if the covered property meets any
34 of the following criteria:
LC000179 - Page 10 of 16
1 (1) A demolition permit was issued, or demolition is planned, that will prevent achievement
2 of the next interim building performance standard;
3 (2) The covered building did not have a certificate of occupancy or temporary certificate
4 of occupancy for all twelve (12) months of the baseline year prior to the interim building
5 performance standard compliance schedule;
6 (3) The covered property is in financial hardship, as defined guidance or regulations issued
7 by the EC4; or
8 (4) The EC4 determines that strict compliance with the provisions of this law would cause
9 financial hardship or would not be in the public interest.
10 Any approved alternative, extension, adjustment or exemption shall apply only to the
11 specific interim or final building performance standard and shall expire no later than the end of the
12 relevant five (5) year period.
13 (c) The EC4 shall establish penalties for violations of this chapter through promulgation of
14 regulations issued pursuant to this chapter. In doing so, the EC4 shall endeavor to minimize
15 disproportionate impacts on communities impacted by poverty and environmental injustice. The
16 EC4 may coordinate with the department of environmental management (DEM) for enforcement
17 of the building performance standards, and the standards and requirements herein.
18 (d) Pursuant to each of the benchmarking requirements and the building performance
19 standards established under this chapter, the EC4 shall establish in regulations the process and
20 criteria for a building owner to apply for, and for the EC4 to grant or deny:
21 (1) A deadline extension; and/or
22 (2) A hardship waiver.
23 (e) The EC4 shall establish penalties for covered properties for violation of benchmarking
24 requirements and for violation of building performance standards. Such payment amounts or
25 formula shall reflect:
26 (1) The total number of annual benchmarking submissions which a covered property has
27 failed to achieve;
28 (2) The total number of interim and final building performance standards which a covered
29 property has failed to achieve;
30 (3) The assessed value of the covered property; and
31 (4) The magnitude of non-compliance under each performance metric.
32 (f) An owner whose covered property fails to comply with benchmarking requirements or
33 meet an interim or final building performance standard by the applicable compliance date shall be
34 required to make a penalty payment. Any owner who does not reside or conduct their business in
LC000179 - Page 11 of 16
1 the covered property, but leases the covered property to a tenant or multiple tenants, shall remain
2 the party responsible for ensuring compliance with this section. Any penalty payments rendered as
3 a result of non-compliance shall not be passed on to any tenant who may lease the covered property
4 in order to offset the cost to the owner.
5 (g) The BPS fund is hereby established as a permanent designated fund managed by the
6 EC4. The BPS fund shall be used to support the building benchmarking and performance
7 improvement program established in this law.
8 (1) All funds collected from payment of penalties assessed shall be deposited into the BPS
9 fund.
10 (2) All funds deposited into the BPS fund, and any interest earned on the funds, shall not
11 revert to the unrestricted fund balance of the general fund at the end of a fiscal year, or at any other
12 time, but shall be continually available for the uses and purposes set forth in this chapter without
13 regard to fiscal year limitation.
14 (3) Additional funds from other sources may also be deposited into the BPS fund.
15 23-27.5-8. Rules and regulations.
16 The EC4 shall promulgate rules and regulations to implement and enforce the provisions
17 of this chapter.
18 23-27.5-9. Appeals.
19 An owner aggrieved by this section or compliance orders resulting therefrom may appeal
20 pursuant to the provisions of chapter 35 of title 42 ("administrative procedures").

IN GENERAL ASSEMBLY
JANUARY SESSION, A.D. 2025
____________
A N A C T
RELATING TO HEALTH AND SAFETY -- BUILDING DECARBONIZATION ACT OF 2024
Introduced By: Senators Kallman, Sosnowski, DiMario, Euer, Lawson, Britto, Gu, Gallo,
McKenney, and Valverde
Date Introduced: January 31, 2025
Referred To: Senate Environment & Agriculture
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Findings and purpose.
2 The purpose of this chapter is to understand and reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of
3 buildings in Rhode Island, consistent with an Act on Climate, chapter 6.2-9 of title 42. Of the
4 building stock in 2050, approximately seventy percent (70%) has already been built, and addressing
5 these existing buildings is critical to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. While significant
6 retrofits to existing buildings will eventually be needed, this chapter establishes a program for the
7 energy benchmarking of large buildings in Rhode Island and a standard for their energy
8 performance and requires that the construction or alteration of new buildings be electric-ready.
9 Further, the intent of the legislature is to ensure that the Executive Climate Change Coordinating
10 Council (EC4) has dedicated resources sufficient to administer its responsibilities under this chapter
11 to enable swift and steady progress towards Rhode Island's net-zero mandate.
12 SECTION 2. Title 23 of the General Laws entitled "HEALTH AND SAFETY" is hereby

3 than one hundred thousand (100,000) customers shall make available to owners of covered
4 properties anonymized and aggregated usage data for owner's covered property for the purpose of
5 compliance with this chapter. By nature of being aggregated, the intent is to anonymize individual
6 tenant energy use information, and not disclose this or any other personal information related to
7 tenant customers or their accounts.
8 (m) To the extent that gas and electric companies incur new or additional expenses to
9 collect, aggregate, organize, or provide energy use information under this chapter, prior to filing
10 for cost recovery, shall first demonstrate good faith efforts to secure federal, state, or other relevant
11 funding options. Thereafter, such additional expenses shall be eligible for cost recovery through
12 rates charged to customers under the appropriate cost recovery mechanisms as determined by the
13 public utilities commission.
14 (n) Electric and gas distribution utilities shall collaborate with the EC4 to identify best
15 practices for collecting and managing aggregated whole building data.
16 (o) The EC4 shall endeavor to ensure that electric and gas distribution companies or other
17 energy efficiency program administrator provide owners of buildings subject to this section with
18 up-to-date information about energy efficiency opportunities or actions available to increase energy
19 efficiency, including incentives in utility-administered or other energy efficiency programs and
20 changes in energy assessment technology.
21 23-27.5-5. Municipal implementation of building energy benchmarking
22 requirements.
23 (a) The EC4 shall establish procedures, including a process and conditions, for a
24 municipality to apply to the EC4 for the right to implement, in place of the EC4, the building energy
25 benchmarking requirements. Such conditions shall include, at a minimum, acceptance of
26 responsibility to collect the information specified by the EC4 from the covered property owners on
27 the schedule specified by the EC4, and the provision of benchmarking data to the EC4 annually.
28 (b) The EC4 shall review any application from a municipality to implement the building
29 energy benchmarking requirements and the EC4 may deny a request if it is not satisfied that the
30 conditions in subsection (a) of this section are met. A denial shall include a finding of facts and
31 final determination that the municipal plan does not meet the requirements of this section.
32 (c) A municipality that is approved to implement the building energy benchmarking
33 requirements shall be authorized to assess any fines related to the program as provided in the
34 approval by the EC4. Funds collected by a municipality shall be retained by the municipality.
LC000179 - Page 8 of 16

1 (d) The EC4 shall evaluate any municipal programs established under this subsection at
2 least once every five (5) years and may withdraw its approval if municipal programs fail to comply
3 with those conditions.
4 (e) In the case of a municipality that has initiated a building energy benchmarking
5 requirement prior to the enactment of this law, the municipality may continue such program in lieu
6 of the benchmarking requirements to be established by the EC4. In such case, the municipality must
7 notify the EC4 of such intent within one hundred eighty (180) days of the enactment of this chapter
8 and must provide benchmarking data to the EC4 annually thereafter.
9 23-27.5-6. Building performance improvement.
10 (a) On a regular basis, the EC4 shall evaluate data relevant to understanding the energy use
11 and greenhouse gas emissions of buildings in Rhode Island, including, but not limited, to the
12 benchmarking data collected under this chapter. The EC4 shall publish reports summarizing the
13 data and the status of building emissions in Rhode Island biennially. Beginning no later than August
14 31, 2029, and annually thereafter, the EC4 shall post benchmarking data for the prior calendar year.
15 Such posted benchmarking data shall include, at a minimum, for each covered property required to
16 submit energy use information for the given calendar year, the address of the covered property and
17 its energy performance rating or assessment score.
18 (b) No later than August 31, 2029, the EC4 shall publish a report including a summary of
19 its activities and progress under this chapter and detailing recommended measures, policies and
20 programs to achieve building emission reductions aligned with Rhode Island's net zero goal. The
21 EC4 shall issue supplemental reports biennially for a period of twenty (20) years.
22 (c) Performance metrics shall include site energy use intensity and may also include
23 greenhouse gas emissions or other metrics relevant to the purpose of this chapter.
24 (d) No later than June 30, 2030, the EC4 shall select performance metrics and set a building
25 performance standard for each property type or subcategory.
26 (e) The EC4 shall set final building performance standards that shall collectively cause the
27 aggregate greenhouse gas emissions attributable to all covered properties to be reduced in line with
28 reaching net zero by 2050.
29 (f) The EC4 shall set interim building performance standards for covered properties that
30 are applicable at the end of each five (5) year period between adoption and 2050. In doing so the
31 EC4 may use a straight-line trajectory, from the covered property's baseline performance for each
32 performance metric to the final building performance standard for that performance metric such
33 that each calculated performance metric shall improve in equal increments during each five (5) year
34 period. The EC4 may use other means to calculate interim building performance standards if it
LC000179 - Page 9 of 16

1 deems the straight-line trajectory approach ill-suited for a covered property type.
2 (g) As of June 30, 2035, and at the end of every five (5) year period thereafter, the owner
3 of a covered property shall demonstrate progress toward each applicable final building performance
4 standard by achieving the interim building performance standard(s) set by the EC4 for the covered
5 property.
6 (h) If the owner of a covered property believes that the owner cannot reasonably meet one
7 or more of the applicable interim or final building performance standards, then the owner may
8 propose an alternative building performance action plan to the EC4. If the EC4 approves an
9 alternative building performance action plan for a covered property, then the owner shall be
10 responsible only to comply with the provisions of the alternative building performance action plan
11 until the next compliance date.
12 (i) The EC4 shall issue forms, guidance and promulgate regulations necessary to implement
13 this section including requirements for building performance action plans.
14 (j) In consultation with the EJAB, the EC4 shall provide technical assistance for owners
15 lacking the financial, operational, or technical capacity to meet interim or final building
16 performance standards. To the extent possible, such assistance shall include information on
17 potential loan, grant, and other financing options for owners.
18 (k) The EC4 shall coordinate with utility companies, energy efficiency program
19 administrators, the public utilities commission, state agencies, and local governments, as
20 appropriate, to support the implementation of its recommendations pursuant to this section.
21 (l) In the case of a municipality that has initiated a building energy performance
22 requirement prior to the enactment of this law, the municipality may continue such program in lieu
23 of the requirements to be established by the EC4 under this section. In such case, the municipality
24 must notify the EC4 of such intent within one hundred eighty (180) days of the enactment of this
25 chapter and must provide program and performance information to the EC4 annually thereafter.
26 23-27.5-7. Compliance assurance.
27 (a) The EC4 shall establish a program to maximize owner compliance with this chapter.
28 The EC4 shall issue forms, guidance and promulgate regulations as necessary to implement the
29 compliance program, and shall revise such forms, guidance and regulations from time to time as
30 needed.
31 (b) The EC4 may grant an extension, adjustment or exemption to an interim or final
32 building performance standards for a covered property whose owner submits a request, together
33 with documentation, in a form and date prescribed by the EC4, if the covered property meets any
34 of the following criteria:
LC000179 - Page 10 of 16

1 (1) A demolition permit was issued, or demolition is planned, that will prevent achievement
2 of the next interim building performance standard;
3 (2) The covered building did not have a certificate of occupancy or temporary certificate
4 of occupancy for all twelve (12) months of the baseline year prior to the interim building
5 performance standard compliance schedule;
6 (3) The covered property is in financial hardship, as defined guidance or regulations issued
7 by the EC4; or
8 (4) The EC4 determines that strict compliance with the provisions of this law would cause
9 financial hardship or would not be in the public interest.
10 Any approved alternative, extension, adjustment or exemption shall apply only to the
11 specific interim or final building performance standard and shall expire no later than the end of the
12 relevant five (5) year period.
13 (c) The EC4 shall establish penalties for violations of this chapter through promulgation of
14 regulations issued pursuant to this chapter. In doing so, the EC4 shall endeavor to minimize
15 disproportionate impacts on communities impacted by poverty and environmental injustice. The
16 EC4 may coordinate with the department of environmental management (DEM) for enforcement
17 of the building performance standards, and the standards and requirements herein.
18 (d) Pursuant to each of the benchmarking requirements and the building performance
19 standards established under this chapter, the EC4 shall establish in regulations the process and
20 criteria for a building owner to apply for, and for the EC4 to grant or deny:
21 (1) A deadline extension; and/or
22 (2) A hardship waiver.
23 (e) The EC4 shall establish penalties for covered properties for violation of benchmarking
24 requirements and for violation of building performance standards. Such payment amounts or
25 formula shall reflect:
26 (1) The total number of annual benchmarking submissions which a covered property has
27 failed to achieve;
28 (2) The total number of interim and final building performance standards which a covered
29 property has failed to achieve;
30 (3) The assessed value of the covered property; and
31 (4) The magnitude of non-compliance under each performance metric.
32 (f) An owner whose covered property fails to comply with benchmarking requirements or
33 meet an interim or final building performance standard by the applicable compliance date shall be
34 required to make a penalty payment. Any owner who does not reside or conduct their business in
LC000179 - Page 11 of 16

1 the covered property, but leases the covered property to a tenant or multiple tenants, shall remain
2 the party responsible for ensuring compliance with this section. Any penalty payments rendered as
3 a result of non-compliance shall not be passed on to any tenant who may lease the covered property
4 in order to offset the cost to the owner.
5 (g) The BPS fund is hereby established as a permanent designated fund managed by the
6 EC4. The BPS fund shall be used to support the building benchmarking and performance
7 improvement program established in this law.
8 (1) All funds collected from payment of penalties assessed shall be deposited into the BPS
9 fund.
10 (2) All funds deposited into the BPS fund, and any interest earned on the funds, shall not
11 revert to the unrestricted fund balance of the general fund at the end of a fiscal year, or at any other
12 time, but shall be continually available for the uses and purposes set forth in this chapter without
13 regard to fiscal year limitation.
14 (3) Additional funds from other sources may also be deposited into the BPS fund.
15 23-27.5-8. Rules and regulations.
16 The EC4 shall promulgate rules and regulations to implement and enforce the provisions
17 of this chapter.
18 23-27.5-9. Appeals.
19 An owner aggrieved by this section or compliance orders resulting therefrom may appeal
20 pursuant to the provisions of chapter 35 of title 42 ("administrative procedures").
21 SECTION 3. Chapter 23-27.3 of the General Laws entitled "State Building Code" is hereby
22 amended by adding thereto the following sections:
23 23-27.3-130. Electric-ready new buildings.

LC000179 - Page 13 of 16

1 (1) The awarding authority of any project under this chapter shall take all necessary actions
2 to ensure that each contractor and subcontractor involved in new public building construction
3 projects or alteration projects over five million dollars ($5,000,000) requires all contractors and
4 subcontractor on the project to have or be affiliated with a non-provisionally approved registered
5 apprenticeship program conforming to the standards set forth in 29 CFR § 29.5. and also require
6 that not less than fifteen percent (15%) of the total hours worked by the contractors' and
7 subcontractors' employees to be completed by apprentices registered in registered apprenticeship
8 programs as defined herein. The awarding agency may lower the fifteen percent (15%) requirement
9 only if it determines in writing that compliance is not feasible or that it would be unduly cost
10 prohibitive to the project.
11 (2) The awarding authority of any project under this chapter shall conduct an independent,
12 objective, reasoned study, using reviewable criteria, to determine whether adoption of a project
13 labor agreement on the proposed project or projects will help achieve the goals of the state
14 purchases act, for all new public building construction projects or alteration projects over twenty-
15 five million dollars ($25,000,000).
16 23-27.3-130.4. Exemptions.
17 (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter, a permit for construction of a new
18 mixed-fuel building may be issued upon a finding by the permitting body that constructing an all-
19 electric building or project is physically or technically infeasible and that a modification is
20 warranted. Financial considerations shall not be a sufficient basis to determine physical or technical
21 infeasibility. Modifications shall only be issued under this exception where the permitting body
22 finds that:
23 (1) Sufficient evidence was submitted to substantiate the infeasibility of an all-electric
24 building or project design. Such evidence shall show that the building either:
25 (i) Cannot satisfy necessary building code requirements without the usage of gas or oil
26 piping systems, fixtures and/or infrastructure; or
27 (ii) If the building is specifically designated for occupancy by commercial or industrial
28 uses which cannot feasibly operate using commercially available all-electric appliances; or
29 (iii) If mixed fuel is used to meet building energy needs and said building or group of
30 buildings are for the sole use as a hospital, medical facility, or laboratory for biological research.
31 (2) The installation of natural gas or oil piping systems, fixtures and/or infrastructure is
32 strictly limited to the system and area of the building for which an all-electric building or project
33 design is infeasible.
34 (3) The area or service within the project where gas or oil piping systems, fixtures and/or
LC000179 - Page 14 of 16

1 infrastructure are installed is all-electric ready.
2 (4) The project's modified design provides equivalent health, safety, and fire protection to
3 an all-electric building or project design.
4 23-27.3-130.5. Rules and regulations.
5 The state building code commission shall propose guidelines for electric-ready buildings
6 by September 1, 2025, and shall make all efforts to promulgate final rules by December 1, 2025.
7 SECTION 4. This act shall take effect upon passage.
