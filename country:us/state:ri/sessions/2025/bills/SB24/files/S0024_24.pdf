RELATING TO HEALTH AND SAFETY -- HIGH HEAT WASTE FACILITY ACT
Introduced By: Senators Ujifusa, Euer, Valverde, Pearson, Bell, Murray, Zurier, and
Kallman
Date Introduced: January 23, 2025
Referred To: Senate Environment & Agriculture
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Findings.
2 (1) As stated in §§ 23-19-3(14) and (16), solid waste incineration releases more than four
3 hundred (400) toxic pollutants including lead, mercury, dioxins, and acid gasses; poses
4 unacceptable threats to the health and safety of Rhode Islanders and the environment; and is the
5 most costly method of waste disposal;
6 (2) Energy derived from the combustion of solid waste, and from the combustion of fuels
7 derived from solid waste, is not renewable energy; and
8 (3) It is in the best interests of the health, safety, and welfare of residents and visitors to
9 Rhode Island to protect our communities, environment, climate, and natural resources by
10 prohibiting the construction and operation of solid waste incinerators, waste-to-fuel facilities,
11 waste-to-chemical facilities, and other high-heat waste facilities.
12 SECTION 2. Title 23 of the General Laws entitled "HEALTH AND SAFETY" is hereby
13 amended by adding thereto the following chapter:
14 CHAPTER 19.19
15 HIGH HEAT WASTE FACILITY ACT
16 23-19.19-1. Definitions.
17 (1) "Construction and demolition (C&D) debris" has the same meaning as set forth in § 23-
18 18.9-7.
19 (2) "Depolymerization" means a process through which heat, pressure, and/or solvents are

1 used to break plastic polymers into oligomers and/or monomers.
2 (3) "Gasification" means a process through which materials are exposed to heat, converting
3 carbon-based materials to synthetic fuels, chemical feedstocks, waxes, lubricants, or other
4 substances and solid residues, slag, ash, char, liquid wastes, and/or wastewater.
5 (4) "Hazardous waste" has the same meaning as set forth in § 23-19.1-4.
6 (5) "High-heat waste facility" means a facility which:
7 (i) Uses any disposal, treatment, recycling, or manufacturing process including, but not
8 limited to, combustion, incineration, gasification, pyrolysis, hydropyrolysis, solvolysis, or
9 depolymerization, that exposes solid waste, segregated solid waste, recyclable materials,
10 construction and demolition (C&D) debris, post-use polymers, or recovered feedstock to
11 temperatures above four hundred degrees Fahrenheit (400⁰ F); or
12 (ii) Combusts chemicals, feedstocks, fuels, monomers, oligomers, hydrocarbons, or waste
13 residues derived from any process that exposes solid waste, segregated solid waste, recyclable
14 materials, construction and demolition (C&D) debris, post-use polymers, or recovered feedstock to
15 temperatures above four hundred degrees Fahrenheit (400⁰ F).
16 (iii) "High-heat waste facility" also includes advanced recycling facilities, chemical
17 recycling facilities, molecular recycling facilities, and any other facility that uses a thermochemical
18 process to convert post-use polymers, plastic, or recovered feedstock into fuels, chemical
19 feedstocks, monomers, oligomers, hydrocarbons, waxes, lubricants, feedstocks, fuels, or
20 hydrocarbons.
21 (6) "Hydropyrolysis" means a process through which materials are exposed to heat in the
22 presence of hydrogen, converting carbon-based materials to synthetic fuels, chemical feedstocks,
23 waxes, lubricants, or other substances and solid residues, slag, ash, char, liquid wastes, and/or
24 wastewater.
25 (7) "Plastic" means a synthetic material made from linking monomers through a chemical
26 reaction to create a polymer chain, including material derived from either petroleum or a
27 biologically based polymer, such as corn or other plant sources.
28 (8) "Post-use polymer" means a plastic polymer previously used in any industrial,
29 commercial, agricultural, or domestic activity.
30 (9) "Pyrolysis" means a process through which materials are exposed to heat in the absence
31 of oxygen, converting carbon-based materials to synthetic fuels, chemical feedstocks, waxes,
32 lubricants, or other substances and solid residues, slag, ash, char, liquid wastes, and/or wastewater.
33 (10) "Recovered feedstock" means material derived and separated from solid waste,
34 segregated solid waste, recyclable materials, or construction and demolition (C&D) debris for use

1 as a feedstock or raw material in a high-heat waste facility.
2 (11) "Recyclable materials" has the same meaning as set forth in § 23-18.9-7.
3 (12) "Segregated solid waste" has the same meaning as set forth in § 23-18.9-7.
4 (13) "Solid waste" has the same meaning as set forth in § 23-18.9-7.
5 (14) "Solvolysis" means a process through which materials are combined with a solvent
6 and subjected to heat and/or high pressure.
7 23-19.19-2. Prohibition on new high-heat waste facilities.
8 Notwithstanding any other law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, no permit or license shall
9 be issued for the construction or operation of a new high-heat waste facility, and no application for
10 a permit or license for such a facility shall be granted or issued by the state.
11 SECTION 3. This act shall take effect upon passage.
