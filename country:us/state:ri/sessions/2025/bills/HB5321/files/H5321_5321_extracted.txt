IN GENERAL ASSEMBLY
JANUARY SESSION, A.D. 2025
____________
A N A C T
Introduced By: Representatives Cruz, Diaz, Kislak, Ajello, Morales, Messier, Sanchez,
Potter, Giraldo, and Speakman
Date Introduced: February 05, 2025
Referred To: House Finance
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Legislative findings.
2 (1) High-quality and affordable child care is critical to supporting children and families
3 throughout Rhode Island and ensuring a functioning labor market and economy in the state.
4 (2) Providing universal access to affordable, quality child care will address staffing
5 shortages across the economy, can reduce state government expenditures in other areas such as
6 Medicaid and food assistance, and will increase tax revenue as parents of young children are able
7 to stay in the workforce and earn incomes.
8 (3) Child care in the United States is currently a broken market, with the cost of care being
9 both too expensive for many families who need it to afford and the wages of child care educators
10 being too low to attract and retain skilled staff.
11 (4) To create a child care system that supports our Rhode Island families, workers, and
12 economy we must recognize that child care is a public good akin to kindergarten through grade
13 twelve (K-12) education. This means assisting families to be able to choose sustainable, quality
14 child care for their children and supporting child care providers, centers, family child care homes,
15 and child care educators to be able to provide high-quality care.
16 (5) According to a September 2021 report from the US Department of the Treasury, one
17 out of every one hundred ten (110) U.S. workers and one out of every fifty-five (55) working
18 women works in the early education and child care sector.
19 (6) The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has established clear guidelines
1 for establishing whether child care is affordable, which state that families should pay no more than
2 seven percent (7%) of their family income towards child care. Using that standard, most families
3 with young children in Rhode Island require assistance to afford child care.
4 SECTION 2. Title 40 of the General Laws entitled "HUMAN SERVICES" is hereby
5 amended by adding thereto the following chapter:
6 CHAPTER 6.7
7 RHODE ISLAND CHILD CARE FOR ALL ACT
8 40-6.7-1. The office for early learning.
9 (a) By April 1, 2026, the executive branch shall produce a report outlining the costs and
10 staffing requirements to create an office for early learning (the "office") and describing the
11 transition plan for how responsibilities previously managed by other departments shall be
12 transferred to the office.
13 (b) Effective June 30, 2027, the office for early learning shall be established within the
14 executive branch of state government, to serve as the principal agency for managing a statewide
15 early learning system. The office shall have the following powers and duties in accordance with
16 the following schedule:
17 (1) On or about June 30, 2027, to assume functions related to early childcare set forth in
18 chapter 12 of title 42, to be transferred from the department of human services, including the
19 administration of the child care assistance program, the quality rating and improvement system for
20 child care and early learning programs, and child care licensing;
21 (2) The Rhode Island head start collaboration office shall be transferred to the office for
22 early learning.
23 (3) On or about June 30, 2027, to assume functions related to pre-kindergarten set forth in
24 chapter 87 of title 16, to be transferred from the department of education;
25 (4) On or before December 1, 2027, to provide the senate and house of representatives a
26 comprehensive study of the existing early childhood education infrastructure, a review of roles,
27 functions, and programs of the office for early learning, and a workforce training plan in
28 collaboration with the department of labor and training and the department of education; and
29 (5) To be responsible for the development, sustainability and continuous improvement of
30 a mixed-delivery system of high-quality, accessible and affordable child care for children from
31 infancy through age twelve (12), as well as free, high-quality, accessible pre-kindergarten for
32 children ages three (3) and four (4).
33 (c) The department of administration shall furnish the office with suitable offices and
34 telephone service in the state house, state office building, or some other convenient location, for
LC000523 - Page 2 of 11
1 the transaction of its business.
2 40-6.7-2. Direct support to child care providers program.
3 (a) The office for early learning shall establish programs of annual funding to early
4 education and care providers to meet the full range of costs of high quality early education and care
5 to the extent that fees, whether subsidized or unsubsidized, charged for the children receiving early
6 education and care services do not meet these costs. This funding shall be used to address the
7 following priorities:
8 (1) Expanding affordability of early education and care to families by reducing the
9 percentage of early education and care costs that must be covered by fees charged for children
10 receiving early education and care, whether subsidized or unsubsidized.
11 (2) Enabling early education and care providers to provide high-quality early education and
12 care and to comply fully with all applicable health, safety, educational, quality-assurance, and other
13 requirements imposed by the office consistent with this chapter to ensure the well-being and
14 promote healthy development and learning of children.
15 (3) Ensuring all early education and care providers are able to attract and retain qualified
16 and skilled educators for children from birth through kindergarten entry with compensation that is
17 competitive with similarly qualified kindergarten through grade twelve (K-12) staff by providing
18 resources through wage supplements or other strategies. Early education and care providers
19 receiving funding shall ensure that the compensation of the educators they employ is in line with
20 the benchmarks set by the early educator and care provider compensation task force as set forth in
21 this section.
22 (4) Maintaining and increasing the supply of early education and care spaces in ways that
23 address shortages in available spaces related to: location within the state, child age range, adequate
24 staffing and supports to achieve best practices for serving children with developmental delays and
25 disabilities, ability to promote the development of children who are multilingual learners, and
26 ability to provide care during nonstandard hours.
27 (5) Enabling early education and care providers to address emergency situations, during
28 which the cost of care significantly increases due to additional federal, state, or office requirements,
29 or the loss of fees due to absence or unenrollment jeopardizes early education and care providers'
30 ability to retain their facilities and staff.
31 (6) Enabling early education and care providers to maintain or increase capacity to provide
32 direct services and to partner with early intervention programs and local school districts to ensure
33 children from birth through kindergarten entry who have developmental delays and disabilities
34 have access to high-quality services required under the federal Individuals with Disabilities
LC000523 - Page 3 of 11
1 Education Act. Additional services that early care and education providers shall be supported to
2 provide enrolled children and their families, can also include social work services, health and
3 mental health services, and other supports for families, parents, and caregivers.
4 (b) The office for early learning shall conduct regular cost of care surveys by which the
5 rates paid to early education and care providers shall be determined. The rate determination shall
6 be based in part on the recommendations of the early educator and care provider compensation task
7 force, as set forth in this section, to allow providers to meet the compensation benchmarks outlined
8 by the task force.
9 (c) The office for early learning shall require early education and care providers to meet
10 conditions for receiving funding under this section, including to:
11 (1) Provide data that the office for early learning requires, as needed to carry out the office's
12 assessment and reporting requirements under this chapter;
13 (2) Have a current Rhode Island child care license; and
14 (3) Comply with all requirements of the funding and ensure funds are used solely for
15 eligible activities and costs that advance affordability, access, equity, and quality.
16 (d) The office for early learning shall determine the amount of funding to be paid under
17 this section to an early education and care provider and shall take into account the following factors:
18 (1) The provider's existing enrollment of children, broken down by age range;
19 (2) Economies of scale, such that smaller providers may have higher costs in some areas
20 necessitating proportionately higher funding; and
21 (3) Any variation in costs to the provider due to location within the state.
22 (e) The office for early learning shall establish a program of annual grants to early
23 education and child care providers who may apply for the grants to assist with special categories
24 of care that present particular challenges to providing at a rate that is affordable to families. The
25 types of care eligible for these grants may include infant care, care for children with physical,
26 intellectual, or developmental disabilities, and non-traditional hour care.
27 (f) The office for early learning shall accord to the early education and care providers to
28 which the office allocates funding under this section a presumption of annual renewal if the
29 provider has complied with all requirements and the appropriations for this section are not reduced
30 such that renewal of all providers is not possible.
31 (g) In the event of insufficient funding for all eligible early education and care providers,
32 the office for early learning shall select providers based on the following criteria:
33 (1) The number of children with physical, developmental, or intellectual disabilities,
34 children who are homeless, and children who are at risk for involvement with or in the care of the
LC000523 - Page 4 of 11
1 department of children, youth and families, currently enrolled with the provider;
2 (2) Whether the provider, if funded, would have the capacity and expertise to serve children
3 with developmental delays or disabilities, or children who are multilingual learners or whose
4 parents or caregivers have limited English proficiency;
5 (3) Whether the provider, if funded, would have the capacity and expertise to serve children
6 and families with physical, developmental, or intellectual disabilities as defined by statute, children
7 who are homeless, and children who are at risk for involvement with or in the care of the department
8 of children, youth and families;
9 (4) Whether the provider, if funded, would increase services in locations within the state
10 that have shortages of spaces for particular age groups, such as infants and toddlers, or that have
11 overall shortages of early education and care spaces or unmet needs for nonstandard hours of care;
12 and
13 (5) Whether the provider, if funded, would implement a proposed quality improvement
14 plan or other innovations that increase the quality of its early education and care services.
15 (h) The office for early learning shall adopt rules and regulations implementing the
16 provisions of the section, after providing the opportunity for public comment, to be accepted
17 through both testimony at public hearings and written comments, and after consideration of these
18 comments.

24 earnings of each adult family member. Earnings of a child under age eighteen (18) years shall not
25 be counted. Income shall also include unearned income subject to exclusions as determined by
26 office regulations.
27 (b) In determining eligibility for child care assistance for children of members of reserve
28 components called to active duty during a time of conflict, the office shall freeze the family
29 composition and the family income of the reserve component member as it was in the month prior
30 to the month of leaving for active duty. This freeze shall continue until the individual is officially
31 discharged from active duty.

IN GENERAL ASSEMBLY
JANUARY SESSION, A.D. 2025
____________
A N A C T
RELATING TO HUMAN SERVICES -- RHODE ISLAND CHILD CARE FOR ALL ACT
Introduced By: Representatives Cruz, Diaz, Kislak, Ajello, Morales, Messier, Sanchez,
Potter, Giraldo, and Speakman
Date Introduced: February 05, 2025
Referred To: House Finance
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Legislative findings.
2 (1) High-quality and affordable child care is critical to supporting children and families
3 throughout Rhode Island and ensuring a functioning labor market and economy in the state.
4 (2) Providing universal access to affordable, quality child care will address staffing
5 shortages across the economy, can reduce state government expenditures in other areas such as
6 Medicaid and food assistance, and will increase tax revenue as parents of young children are able
7 to stay in the workforce and earn incomes.
8 (3) Child care in the United States is currently a broken market, with the cost of care being
9 both too expensive for many families who need it to afford and the wages of child care educators
10 being too low to attract and retain skilled staff.
11 (4) To create a child care system that supports our Rhode Island families, workers, and
12 economy we must recognize that child care is a public good akin to kindergarten through grade
13 twelve (K-12) education. This means assisting families to be able to choose sustainable, quality
14 child care for their children and supporting child care providers, centers, family child care homes,
15 and child care educators to be able to provide high-quality care.
16 (5) According to a September 2021 report from the US Department of the Treasury, one
17 out of every one hundred ten (110) U.S. workers and one out of every fifty-five (55) working
18 women works in the early education and child care sector.
19 (6) The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has established clear guidelines

1 for establishing whether child care is affordable, which state that families should pay no more than
2 seven percent (7%) of their family income towards child care. Using that standard, most families
3 with young children in Rhode Island require assistance to afford child care.
4 SECTION 2. Title 40 of the General Laws entitled "HUMAN SERVICES" is hereby
5 amended by adding thereto the following chapter:
6 CHAPTER 6.7
7 RHODE ISLAND CHILD CARE FOR ALL ACT
8 40-6.7-1. The office for early learning.
9 (a) By April 1, 2026, the executive branch shall produce a report outlining the costs and
10 staffing requirements to create an office for early learning (the "office") and describing the
11 transition plan for how responsibilities previously managed by other departments shall be

3 (a) The office for early learning shall establish programs of annual funding to early
4 education and care providers to meet the full range of costs of high quality early education and care
5 to the extent that fees, whether subsidized or unsubsidized, charged for the children receiving early
6 education and care services do not meet these costs. This funding shall be used to address the
7 following priorities:
8 (1) Expanding affordability of early education and care to families by reducing the
9 percentage of early education and care costs that must be covered by fees charged for children
10 receiving early education and care, whether subsidized or unsubsidized.
11 (2) Enabling early education and care providers to provide high-quality early education and
12 care and to comply fully with all applicable health, safety, educational, quality-assurance, and other
13 requirements imposed by the office consistent with this chapter to ensure the well-being and
14 promote healthy development and learning of children.
15 (3) Ensuring all early education and care providers are able to attract and retain qualified
16 and skilled educators for children from birth through kindergarten entry with compensation that is
17 competitive with similarly qualified kindergarten through grade twelve (K-12) staff by providing
18 resources through wage supplements or other strategies. Early education and care providers
19 receiving funding shall ensure that the compensation of the educators they employ is in line with
20 the benchmarks set by the early educator and care provider compensation task force as set forth in
21 this section.
22 (4) Maintaining and increasing the supply of early education and care spaces in ways that
23 address shortages in available spaces related to: location within the state, child age range, adequate
24 staffing and supports to achieve best practices for serving children with developmental delays and
25 disabilities, ability to promote the development of children who are multilingual learners, and
26 ability to provide care during nonstandard hours.
27 (5) Enabling early education and care providers to address emergency situations, during
28 which the cost of care significantly increases due to additional federal, state, or office requirements,
29 or the loss of fees due to absence or unenrollment jeopardizes early education and care providers'
30 ability to retain their facilities and staff.
31 (6) Enabling early education and care providers to maintain or increase capacity to provide
32 direct services and to partner with early intervention programs and local school districts to ensure
33 children from birth through kindergarten entry who have developmental delays and disabilities
34 have access to high-quality services required under the federal Individuals with Disabilities
LC000523 - Page 3 of 11

1 Education Act. Additional services that early care and education providers shall be supported to
2 provide enrolled children and their families, can also include social work services, health and
3 mental health services, and other supports for families, parents, and caregivers.
4 (b) The office for early learning shall conduct regular cost of care surveys by which the
5 rates paid to early education and care providers shall be determined. The rate determination shall
6 be based in part on the recommendations of the early educator and care provider compensation task
7 force, as set forth in this section, to allow providers to meet the compensation benchmarks outlined
8 by the task force.
9 (c) The office for early learning shall require early education and care providers to meet
10 conditions for receiving funding under this section, including to:
11 (1) Provide data that the office for early learning requires, as needed to carry out the office's
12 assessment and reporting requirements under this chapter;
13 (2) Have a current Rhode Island child care license; and
14 (3) Comply with all requirements of the funding and ensure funds are used solely for
15 eligible activities and costs that advance affordability, access, equity, and quality.
16 (d) The office for early learning shall determine the amount of funding to be paid under
17 this section to an early education and care provider and shall take into account the following factors:
18 (1) The provider's existing enrollment of children, broken down by age range;
19 (2) Economies of scale, such that smaller providers may have higher costs in some areas
20 necessitating proportionately higher funding; and
21 (3) Any variation in costs to the provider due to location within the state.
22 (e) The office for early learning shall establish a program of annual grants to early
23 education and child care providers who may apply for the grants to assist with special categories
24 of care that present particular challenges to providing at a rate that is affordable to families. The
25 types of care eligible for these grants may include infant care, care for children with physical,
26 intellectual, or developmental disabilities, and non-traditional hour care.
27 (f) The office for early learning shall accord to the early education and care providers to
28 which the office allocates funding under this section a presumption of annual renewal if the
29 provider has complied with all requirements and the appropriations for this section are not reduced
30 such that renewal of all providers is not possible.
31 (g) In the event of insufficient funding for all eligible early education and care providers,
32 the office for early learning shall select providers based on the following criteria:
33 (1) The number of children with physical, developmental, or intellectual disabilities,
34 children who are homeless, and children who are at risk for involvement with or in the care of the
LC000523 - Page 4 of 11

1 department of children, youth and families, currently enrolled with the provider;
2 (2) Whether the provider, if funded, would have the capacity and expertise to serve children
3 with developmental delays or disabilities, or children who are multilingual learners or whose
4 parents or caregivers have limited English proficiency;
5 (3) Whether the provider, if funded, would have the capacity and expertise to serve children
6 and families with physical, developmental, or intellectual disabilities as defined by statute, children
7 who are homeless, and children who are at risk for involvement with or in the care of the department
8 of children, youth and families;
9 (4) Whether the provider, if funded, would increase services in locations within the state
10 that have shortages of spaces for particular age groups, such as infants and toddlers, or that have
11 overall shortages of early education and care spaces or unmet needs for nonstandard hours of care;
12 and
13 (5) Whether the provider, if funded, would implement a proposed quality improvement
14 plan or other innovations that increase the quality of its early education and care services.
15 (h) The office for early learning shall adopt rules and regulations implementing the
16 provisions of the section, after providing the opportunity for public comment, to be accepted
