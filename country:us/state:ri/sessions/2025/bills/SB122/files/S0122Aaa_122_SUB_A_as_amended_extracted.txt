13 by purchase contracts, lease purchase agreements, installment sales contracts, and/or land contracts,
14 and may accept donations and transfers from municipalities, other quasi-public entities, nonprofit
15 entities, or the state upon such terms and conditions as agreed to by the corporation and the
16 respective municipality, entity or state. Nothing herein shall prevent the corporation from accepting

5 operations or interests for the land bank, the corporation or the state.
6 42-55.2-6. Property in the land bank exempt from legal process.
7 (a) Any land deposited into the land bank inventory shall not be subject to attachment,
8 execution or any judicial or administrative process during the period it is held by the corporation,

11 penalties, assessments or other charges shall be made against the land bank, the corporation or the
12 state for any reason during the period the property is held in the land bank.
13 (b) In the event there is a division in the freehold interest where only a portion of the rights
14 related to the property is located in the land bank, the remainder may be made subject to legal
15 process as long as such process does not act to divest the land bank of any of its attributes of
16 ownership or ability to develop the property.

19 corporation may petition the superior court for partition in which after the required notice and
20 service of process is completed upon confirmatory motion, the land bank shall be awarded and
21 receive the whole fee simple interest by way of an interim order or a final judgment. An interim
22 order or a final judgment constitutes a recordable order which shall be considered binding in the
23 chain of title and any of the remainder portion claimed by another owner or creditor shall be subject
24 to owelty under the law or in equity based on the value of the interest transferred to the land bank.
25 Neither the corporation nor any land subject to such a partition action shall be restrained nor
26 enjoined and no equitable order shall issue to prevent the development of the property by the
27 corporation or its applicant or assignee.

33 municipality shall provide to the corporation and the department of housing by October 1 an
34 inventory of any additional municipal real estate assets which are not under current or planned use
LC000177/SUB A/2 - Page 3 of 6
1 as of July 1 of that year.
2 (b) The department of housing and the corporation will work with municipalities to
3 determine if properties reported under subsection (a) of this section are appropriate for
4 redevelopment as affordable housing, and if so, how to facilitate that process.
5 SECTION 2. Section 37-7-6 of the General Laws in Chapter 37-7 entitled "Management
6 and Disposal of Property" is hereby amended to read as follows:
7 37-7-6. Transfer of land between departments and agencies.

11 improvements thereon and other real property, title to which is vested in the state of Rhode Island,
12 or the title to which will be vested in the state upon completion of any condemnation or other
13 proceeding then pending, from the department, board, bureau, commission, or agency exercising
14 custody, control, or supervision to another department, board, bureau, commission, or agency of
15 the state government. Such transfer may also be made to the Rhode Island housing and mortgage
16 finance corporation (as established in chapter 55 of title 42) or any of its subsidiaries for the
17 purposes of developing or redeveloping the property as affordable or mixed-income housing. The
18 corporation shall offer reasonable compensation, as informed by an appraisal or other independent
19 valuation, for the transfer of state-owned group homes as defined in § 40.1-24-1(6).
