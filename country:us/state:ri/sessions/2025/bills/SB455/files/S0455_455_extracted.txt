4 (a)(1) For decedents whose death occurs on or after January 1, 1992, but prior to January
5 1, 2002, a tax is imposed upon the transfer of the net estate of every resident or nonresident decedent

11 taxes allowed by 26 U.S.C. § 2011 as it was in effect as of January 1, 2001; provided, however,
12 that the tax shall be imposed only if the net taxable estate shall exceed six hundred seventy-five
13 thousand dollars ($675,000). Any scheduled increase in the unified credit provided in 26 U.S.C. §
14 2010 in effect on January 1, 2001, or thereafter, shall not apply.
15 (3) For decedents whose death occurs on or after January 1, 2010, and prior to January 1,
16 2015, a tax is imposed upon the transfer of the net estate of every resident or nonresident decedent

18 taxes allowed by 26 U.S.C. § 2011 as it was in effect as of January 1, 2001; provided, however,
1 that the tax shall be imposed only if the net taxable estate shall exceed eight hundred and fifty
2 thousand dollars ($850,000); provided, further, beginning on January 1, 2011, and each January 1
3 thereafter until January 1, 2015, said amount shall be adjusted by the percentage of increase in the
4 Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U) as published by the United States
5 Department of Labor Statistics determined as of September 30 of the prior calendar year; said
6 adjustment shall be compounded annually and shall be rounded up to the nearest five dollar ($5.00)
7 increment. Any scheduled increase in the unified credit provided in 26 U.S.C. § 2010 in effect on
8 January 1, 2003, or thereafter, shall not apply.
9 (4) For decedents whose death occurs on or after January 1, 2015, a tax is imposed upon

12 § 2011, as it was in effect as of January 1, 2001; provided, however, that a Rhode Island credit shall
13 be allowed against any tax so determined in the amount of sixty-four thousand four hundred
14 ($64,400). Any scheduled increase in the unified credit provided in 26 U.S.C. § 2010 in effect on
15 January 1, 2003, or thereafter, shall not apply; provided, further, beginning on January 1, 2016, and
16 each January 1 thereafter, said Rhode Island credit amount under this section shall be adjusted by
17 the percentage of increase in the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U) as
18 published by the United States Department of Labor Statistics determined as of September 30 of
19 the prior calendar year; said adjustment shall be compounded annually and shall be rounded up to
20 the nearest five dollar ($5.00) increment.
21 (5) For decedents whose death occurs on or after January 1, 2026, a tax is imposed upon
22 the transfer of the net estate of every resident or nonresident decedent as a tax upon the right to
23 transfer. The tax shall be imposed only if the net taxable estate shall exceed three million six
24 hundred thousand dollars ($3,600,000); provided, further, beginning on January 1, 2027, and each
25 January 1, thereafter, said amount shall be increased by one million dollars ($1,000,000).
26 (b) If the decedent’s estate contains property having a tax situs not within the state, then
27 the tax determined by this section is reduced to an amount determined by multiplying the tax by a
28 fraction whose numerator is the gross estate excluding all property having a tax situs not within the
29 state at the decedent’s death and whose denominator is the gross estate. In determining the fraction,
30 no deductions are considered and the gross estate is not reduced by a mortgage or other
31 indebtedness for which the decedent’s estate is not liable.
32 (c)(1) The terms “gross taxable estate,” “federal gross estate” or “net taxable estate” used
33 in this chapter or chapter 23 of this title has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context
34 in the laws of the United States, unless a different meaning is clearly required by the provisions of

2 Internal Revenue Code or other laws of the United States means the Internal Revenue Code of
3 1954, 26 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.
4 (2) For decedents whose death occurs on or after January 1, 2002, the terms “gross taxable
5 estate” “federal gross estate” or “net taxable estate” used in this chapter or chapter 23 of this title

11 (d) All values are as finally determined for federal estate tax purposes.
12 (e) Property has a tax situs within the state of Rhode Island:
13 (1) If it is real estate or tangible personal property and has actual situs within the state of
14 Rhode Island; or
15 (2) If it is intangible personal property and the decedent was a resident.
