COMMEMORATING MAY OF 2025, AS "BRAIN CANCER AND TUMOR AWARENESS
MONTH" IN THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND
Introduced By: Representatives Tanzi, Shekarchi, Blazejewski, Chippendale, Fogarty,
Felix, Ackerman, Ajello, Shallcross Smith, and Cortvriend
Date Introduced: May 27, 2025
Referred To: House read and passed
1 WHEREAS, According to the National Brain Tumor Society, brain tumors and cancers
2 affect Americans at all ages and from all walks of life and the disease has an agonizing impact on
3 the quality of life for both patients and their families; and
4 WHEREAS, Brain tumors are the most common solid cancer in people ages 19 and
5 younger in the United States and are the leading cause of cancer-related death among children
6 and adolescents under 19; and
7 WHEREAS In Rhode Island, a brain tumor is diagnosed in approximately 200 Rhode
8 Islanders annually; and
9 WHEREAS, Approximately 72 percent of all brain tumors are benign, and 28 percent are
10 malignant. Both types have similar signs and symptoms; and
11 WHEREAS, A benign tumor may not be cancerous but can be life-threatening by
12 growing in the brain, and pressing on nearby sections of the brain causing serious injury; and
13 WHEREAS, Malignant or cancerous brain tumors can increase and spread to other brain
14 tissue, causing severe brain damage or death. Both types, malignant and benign tumors, need
15 treatment to prevent further brain injury; and
16 WHEREAS, A primary malignant brain tumor is a rare type of cancer accounting for
17 about 25,400 diagnosed annually in the United States. The most common types are known as
18 secondary tumors, meaning they have metastasized or spread to the brain from other parts of the
19 body such as the lungs, breasts, colon, or prostate; and

1 WHEREAS, All brain tumors, both cancerous and benign, can take a toll on a person's
2 speech, vision, hearing, memory, thoughts, and feelings. The essential parts of our life that make
3 us unique and make us who we are as human beings come from the brain; and
4 WHEREAS, Brain Cancer and Tumor Awareness Month is a time to learn and support
5 not only brain cancer and tumor research and treatment but also a time to raise awareness and
6 support for our friends and neighbors who are on a journey they never thought they would have to
7 take; now, therefore be it
8 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
9 commemorates May of 2025 as "Brain Cancer and Tumor Awareness Month" and urges all
10 Rhode Islanders to understand the importance of research, funding, and support for those who are
11 fighting this unthinkable disease; and be it further
12 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
13 transmit duly certified copies of this resolution to the Rhode Island Brain and Spine Tumor
14 Foundation, and the American Brain Tumor Association.
