IN GENERAL ASSEMBLY

AND INVESTMENT ACT
Introduced By: Senators Ujifusa, Lauria, Lawson, Mack, Paolino, Kallman, Bissaillon,
Ciccone, Quezada, and Valverde
Date Introduced: February 26, 2025
Referred To: Senate Commerce
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Sections 39-28-1 and 39-28-2 of the General Laws in Chapter 39-28 entitled
2 "Broadband Deployment and Investment Act" are hereby amended to read as follows:
3 39-28-1. Findings.
4 The Rhode Island general assembly finds that growth and enhancement of services using
5 internet protocol technology provide Rhode Island consumers more choice in voice, data, and video
6 services than at any other time. The proliferation of new technologies and applications and the
7 growing number of providers developing and offering innovative services using internet protocol
8 are due in large part to little barrier to investment, including freedom from state laws and
9 regulations governing traditional telephone service, that these technologies have enjoyed in Rhode
10 Island, as well as recognition that federal law is more uniform in its oversight of internet protocol-
11 enabled services. The economic benefits, including consumer choice, new jobs, and significant
12 capital investment, will be jeopardized and competition minimized by the imposition of traditional
13 state entry, rate, and service-term regulation on voice over internet protocol service and internet
14 protocol-enabled service. The general assembly finds that the broadband infrastructure which
15 delivers Internet connectivity has become essential for the social, physical, and economic well-
16 being of all Rhode Islanders. This infrastructure enables critical activities and services across
17 numerous sectors that society depends upon including, but not limited to: food delivery, finding
18 housing, providing healthcare, education, environmental monitoring, public safety, energy
1 monitoring, financial services, operating businesses, and government services. The general
2 assembly must ensure broadband services in Rhode Island are reliable, secure, affordable,
3 accessible, and robust for all residents and businesses alike. In order to meet this objective,
4 information must continue to be collected, analyzed, made publicly available, and used to plan and
5 implement policies that effectively protect and seek to improve broadband service in Rhode Island,
6 including creation of a broadband regulatory authority.
7 39-28-2. Definitions.
8 For the purpose of this chapter, the following terms shall have the following meanings:
9 (1) “Voice over internet protocol service” or “VoIP service” means any service that:
10 (i) Enables real-time, two-way voice communications that originate from or terminate at
11 the user’s location in internet protocol or any successor protocol;
12 (ii) Uses a broadband connection from the user’s location; and
13 (iii) Permits users generally to receive calls that originate on the public switched telephone
14 network and to terminate calls to the public switched telephone network.
15 "Broadband" means high-speed Internet access that provides a continuous, reliable
16 connection currently defined by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Broadband can
17 be delivered through technologies such as optical fiber, coaxial cable, fixed wireless, satellite, or
18 cellular networks.
19 (2) “Internet protocol-enabled service” or “IP-enabled service” means any service,
20 capability, functionality, or application provided, except that as provided in subsection (1), using
21 internet protocol, or any successor protocol, that enables an end-user to send or receive a
22 communication in internet protocol format or any successor format.
23 "Internet" means a global network of interconnected computer systems and servers that
24 communicate using Internet protocol (IP) or its successors, enabling the transmission of data, voice,
25 video, and multimedia content. It supports a wide variety of services, including web browsing,
26 email, file sharing, voice over Internet protocol (VoIP), streaming, messaging, and other digital
27 communications and content access.
28 SECTION 2. Sections 39-28-3, 39-28-4, 39-28-5 and 39-28-6 of the General Laws in
29 Chapter 39-28 entitled "Broadband Deployment and Investment Act" are hereby repealed.
30 39-28-3. Regulation.
31 Notwithstanding any general or public law to the contrary, and with the exception of the
32 provisions of § 39-28-4, no department, agency, commission, or political subdivision of Rhode
33 Island shall enact, adopt, or enforce, either directly or indirectly, any law, rule, regulation,
34 ordinance, standard, order, or other provision having the force or effect of law that regulates, or has
LC001576 - Page 2 of 6
1 the effect of regulating, the entry, rates, terms, or conditions of VoIP service or IP-enabled service.
2 39-28-4. Unaffected fees.
3 Nothing in this act shall be construed to affect, mandate, or prohibit the assessment of
4 nondiscriminatory enhanced 911 fees, telecommunications relay service fees, or the
5 telecommunications education access fund surcharge under § 39-1-61.
6 39-28-5. Rights or obligations of carriers.
7 Nothing in this act shall be construed to modify or affect the rights or obligations of any
8 carrier pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 251 or 47 U.S.C. § 252.
9 39-28-6. Effect on tax obligations or authority.
10 Nothing in this act shall be construed to modify or affect any tax obligations imposed by §
11 44-13-4 or the authority of the department of revenue to enforce any such obligations.
12 SECTION 3. Chapter 42-64 of the General Laws entitled "Rhode Island Commerce
13 Corporation" is hereby amended by adding thereto the following section:
