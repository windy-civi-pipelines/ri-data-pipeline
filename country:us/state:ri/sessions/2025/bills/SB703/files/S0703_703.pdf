RELATING TO BUSINESSES AND PROFESSIONS -- PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS
***
1 This act would alter the continuing medical education requirements of physician assistants
2 to fifty (50) credits submitted biannually. This act would also allow physician assistants to render
3 charitable care without a collaborating physician when the physician assistant has appropriate
4 professional liability insurance coverage. This act would alter “The School and Youth Programs
5 Concussion Act” and “The Sudden Cardiac Arrest Prevention Act” to permit physician assistants
6 to clear student athletes to return to athletic activities after being removed from such activities for
7 evoking symptoms of a concussive or cardiac origin. This act would further prohibit restrictive
8 covenants and non-compete agreements that would prohibit physician assistants from practicing in
9 a certain geographic area, advising or treating a patient with whom a relationship was established
10 while the physician assistant was employed by the party to the agreement, or establishing a
11 relationship with another employer. The prohibition of the foregoing would not apply to
12 agreements involving the purchase and sale of a practice.
13 This act would take effect upon passage.
