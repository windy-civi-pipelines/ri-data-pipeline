19 (6) The patient’s right to privacy and confidentiality shall extend to all records pertaining

1 to the patient’s treatment except as otherwise provided by law.
2 (7) The healthcare facility shall respond in a reasonable manner to the request of a patient’s
3 physician, certified nurse practitioner, and/or a physician’s assistant for medical services to the
4 patient. The healthcare facility shall also respond in a reasonable manner to the patient’s request
5 for other services customarily rendered by the healthcare facility to the extent the services do not

7 assistant or are not inconsistent with the patient’s treatment.
8 (8) Before transferring a patient to another facility, the healthcare facility must first inform

12 treatment and the nature of the relationship between the institutions and the healthcare facility.
13 (10)(i) Except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph, if the healthcare facility
14 proposes to use the patient in any human-subjects research, it shall first thoroughly inform the
15 patient of the proposal and offer the patient the right to refuse to participate in the project.
16 (ii) No facility shall be required to inform prospectively the patient of the proposal and the
17 patient’s right to refuse to participate when an institutional review board approves the human-
18 subjects research pursuant to the patient consent and/or de-identification requirements of 21 C.F.R.
19 Pt. 50 and/or 45 C.F.R. Pt. 46 (relating to the informed consent of human subjects).
20 (11) Upon request, the patient shall be allowed to examine and shall be given an
21 explanation of the bill rendered by the healthcare facility irrespective of the source of payment of
22 the bill.
23 (12) Upon request, the patient shall be permitted to examine any pertinent healthcare
24 facility rules and regulations that specifically govern the patient’s treatment.

26 or expression, sexual orientation, race, color, marital status, familial status, disability, religion,
27 national origin, source of income, source of payment, or profession.
28 (14) Patients shall be provided with a summarized medical bill within thirty (30) days of
29 discharge from a healthcare facility. Upon request, the patient shall be furnished with an itemized
30 copy of the patient’s bill. When patients are residents of state-operated institutions and facilities,
