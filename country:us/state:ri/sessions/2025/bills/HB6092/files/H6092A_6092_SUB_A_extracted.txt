11 signatures on them are invalid or insufficient.

12 establishment of the online nomination paper portal provided, however, the secretary of state is

33 unable to write may sign by making his or her mark “X” on the nomination paper in the presence
34 of two (2) witnesses who shall subscribe their names on the paper as witnesses to the signing. For

18 17-14-12. Filing of nomination papers.

20 portal, for state offices or officers and all certified lists of candidates for local offices or officers

8 this section shall be construed to prevent the secretary of state or the local board, as the case may
9 be, from disqualifying a candidate based on the determination of the secretary of state or the local
10 board, acting on its own motion, that the candidate is ineligible or the nomination papers or the
11 signatures on them are invalid or insufficient.
12 SECTION 2. Chapter 17-14 of the General Laws entitled "Nomination of Party and
13 Independent Candidates" is hereby amended by adding thereto the following sections:

18 for at the general election.
19 (b) Once established, the online nomination paper portal would provide voters the ability
20 to electronically sign the nomination papers for candidates for any office the voter may lawfully

6 (f) The online nomination paper portal may be fully implemented for the nomination paper
7 process for the 2028 presidential preference primary and all subsequent elections thereafter. This

10 preference primary.

12 establishment of the online nomination paper portal provided, however, the secretary of state is
13 authorized to utilize federal funds and/or grant funding for the establishment of an online
14 nomination paper portal.
15 (h) The secretary of state may promulgate rules and regulations to establish, maintain, and
16 implement an online nomination paper portal as prescribed in this section.

22 17-14-10.1. Voter attestation when using an online nomination paper portal.
23 Once established, voters using an online nomination paper portal shall affirm, subject to
24 penalty of perjury, that the information the voter has provided via an online nomination paper portal
25 is true and accurate to the best of their knowledge and belief. Voters using an online nomination
26 paper portal shall meet all of the requirements prescribed by § 17-14-4.2(d).
