4 WHEREAS, This event is held to discuss the challenges and advocate for resources to
5 meet the needs of Rhode Island's children and their families and to highlight the work of various
6 organizations and programs in our State that work every day to improve the lives of children,

8 WHEREAS, The world's health care crisis brought to the forefront our State's urgent and
9 critical need and reliance upon safe and continuous child care; and
10 WHEREAS, Research on the human brain reveals that an overwhelming amount of a
11 person's lifetime brain development occurs during early childhood, before the age of three; and
12 WHEREAS, To be prepared for success, our children must receive high-quality child
13 care from caregivers who have the appropriate skills, education, and training; and
14 WHEREAS, A child care teacher's day is spent interacting with children and caring for

16 fundamentals about others, as well as the world around them; and
17 WHEREAS, High quality child care is sensitive, responsive, personal, and
18 developmentally appropriate. It provides the proper nurturing that children need at one of the
19 most critical and vulnerable times in their lives; and

1 WHEREAS, It is of immense importance to our State's economy and to Rhode Island's
2 families that their children receive the highest quality care and are challenged at an early age, in

5 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
