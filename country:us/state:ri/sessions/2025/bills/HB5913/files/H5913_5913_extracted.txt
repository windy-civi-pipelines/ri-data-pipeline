28 (I) Seven million five hundred thousand dollars ($7,500,000);
29 (II) Five percent of the revenue that the nonreference drug holder projected or forecasted
30 it would receive in the first three (3) years of sales of its version of the reference drug documented
31 at least twelve (12) months before the settlement. If no projections or forecasts are available, the
32 compensation does not exceed two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000).
33 (b) An agreement resolving or settling a patent infringement claim that permits a
34 nonreference drug filer to begin selling, offering for sale, or distributing the nonreference drug
LC001823 - Page 4 of 8
1 product if the reference drug holder seeks approval to launch, obtains approval to launch, or
2 launches a different dosage, strength, or form of the reference drug having the same active
3 ingredient before the date set by the agreement for entry of the nonreference drug filer. A different
4 form of the reference drug does not include an authorized generic version of the reference drug.
5 (c) An agreement by the reference drug holder not to interfere with the nonreference drug
6 filer’s ability to secure and maintain regulatory approval to market the nonreference drug product
7 or an agreement to facilitate the nonreference drug filer’s ability to secure and maintain regulatory
8 approval to market the nonreference drug product.
9 (d) An agreement resolving a patent infringement claim in which the reference drug holder
10 forgives the potential damages accrued by a nonreference drug holder for an at-risk launch of the
11 nonreference drug product that is the subject of that claim.
12 (e) Parties to an agreement are not in violation of subsection (a)(1)(i) of this section if they
13 can demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that either of the following are met:
14 (1) The value received by the nonreference drug filer is a fair and reasonable compensation
15 solely for other goods or services that the nonreference drug filer has promised to provide; or
16 (2) The agreement has directly generated procompetitive benefits and the procompetitive
17 benefits of the agreement outweigh the anticompetitive effects of the agreement.
18 (f) In determining whether the parties to the agreement have met their burden under
19 subsection (e) of this section, the factfinder shall not presume any of the following:
20 (1) That entry into the marketplace could not have occurred until the expiration of the
21 relevant patent exclusivity or that the agreement’s provision for entry of the nonreference drug
22 product before the expiration of any patent exclusivity means that the agreement is procompetitive
23 within the meaning of subsection (e) of this section;
24 (2) That any patent is enforceable and infringed by the nonreference drug filer in the
25 absence of a final adjudication binding on the filer of those issues;
26 (3) That the agreement caused no delay in entry of the nonreference drug filer’s drug
27 product because of the lack of federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of that or of
28 another nonreference drug product;
29 (4) That the agreement caused no harm or delay due to the possibility that the nonreference
30 drug filer’s drug product might infringe some patent that has not been asserted against the
31 nonreference drug filer or that is not subject to a final and binding adjudication on that filer as to
32 the patent’s scope, enforceability, and infringement.
33 (5) This subsection shall not be construed to preclude a party from introducing evidence
34 regarding subsections (f)(1) through (f)(4) of this section, inclusive, and shall not be construed to
LC001823 - Page 5 of 8
1 preclude the factfinder from making a determination regarding subsections (f)(1) to (f)(4) of this
2 section, inclusive, based on the full scope of the evidence.
3 (g) In determining whether the parties to the agreement have met their burden under
4 subsection (e)(2) of this section, the factfinder shall presume that the relevant product market is
5 that market consisting of the brand or reference drug of the company alleging patent infringement
6 and the drug product of the nonreference company accused of infringement and any other biological
7 product that is licensed as biosimilar or is an AB-rated generic to the reference product.
8 (h) This section does not modify, impair, limit, or supersede the applicability of chapter 36
9 of title 6 ("antitrust law"), chapter 13 of title 6 ("unfair sales practices"), chapter 13.1 of title 6
10 ("deceptive trade practices"), or the availability of damages or remedies provided therein. This
11 section does not modify, impair, limit, or supersede the right of any drug company applicant to
12 assert claims or counterclaims against any person, under the antitrust laws or other laws relating to
13 unfair competition of the federal antitrust law or state law.
14 (i)(1) Each person that violates or assists in the violation of this section shall forfeit and
15 pay a civil penalty sufficient to deter violations of this section, as follows:
16 (i) If the person who violated this section received any value due to that violation, an
17 amount up to three (3) times the value received by the party that is reasonably attributable to the
18 violation of this section, or twenty million dollars ($20,000,000), whichever is greater;
19 (ii) If the violator has not received anything of value as described in subsection (f)(1)(i) of
20 this section, an amount up to three (3) times the value given to other parties to the agreement
21 reasonably attributable to the violation of this section, or twenty million dollars ($20,000,000),
22 whichever is greater;
23 (iii) For purposes of this section, “reasonably attributable to the violation” shall be
24 determined by Rhode Island’s share of the market for the brand drug at issue in the agreement.
25 (2) Any penalty described herein shall accrue only to the State of Rhode Island and shall
26 be recovered in a civil action brought by the attorney general in its own name, or by any of its
27 attorneys designated by it for that purpose, against any party to an agreement that violates this
28 section.
29 (3) Each party that violates or assists in the violation of this section shall be liable for any
30 damages, penalties, costs, fees, injunctions, or other remedies that may be just and reasonable and
31 available under chapter 36 of title 6 ("antitrust law"), chapter 13 of title 6 ("unfair sales practices"),
32 chapter 13.1 of title 6 ("deceptive trade practices"), as applicable.
33 (4) If the State of Rhode Island is awarded penalties herein, it may not recover penalties
34 pursuant to another law identified in subsection (e)(1) of this section. This section shall not be
LC001823 - Page 6 of 8
1 construed to foreclose the State of Rhode Island’s ability to claim any relief or damages available,
2 other than those that are penalties.
3 (5) An action to enforce a cause of action for a violation of this section shall be commenced
4 within four (4) years after the cause of action accrued.
5 23-25.7-4. Severability.
6 The provisions of this chapter are severable. If any provision of this chapter or its
7 application is held invalid, that invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications that can
8 be given effect without the invalid provision or application.
9 SECTION 2. This act shall take effect upon passage.

RELATING TO HEALTH AND SAFETY -- PRESERVING ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE
DRUGS
***
1 This act would provide that an agreement resolving or settling, on a final or interim basis,
2 a patent infringement claim, in connection with the sale of a pharmaceutical product, is to be
3 presumed to have anticompetitive effects if a nonreference drug filer receives anything of value, as
4 defined, from another company asserting patent infringement and if the nonreference drug filer
5 agrees to limit or forego research, development, manufacturing, marketing, or sales of the
6 nonreference drug filer’s product for any period of time, as specified. The act would provide various
7 exceptions to this prohibition, including, among others, if the agreement has directly generated
8 procompetitive benefits and the procompetitive benefits of the agreement outweigh the
9 anticompetitive effects of the agreement. The act would make a violation of these provisions
10 punishable by a civil penalty that is recoverable only in a civil action brought by the attorney
11 general, as specified.
12 This act would take effect upon passage.

32 compensation does not exceed two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000).
33 (b) An agreement resolving or settling a patent infringement claim that permits a
34 nonreference drug filer to begin selling, offering for sale, or distributing the nonreference drug
LC001823 - Page 4 of 8

1 product if the reference drug holder seeks approval to launch, obtains approval to launch, or
2 launches a different dosage, strength, or form of the reference drug having the same active
3 ingredient before the date set by the agreement for entry of the nonreference drug filer. A different
4 form of the reference drug does not include an authorized generic version of the reference drug.
5 (c) An agreement by the reference drug holder not to interfere with the nonreference drug
6 filer’s ability to secure and maintain regulatory approval to market the nonreference drug product
7 or an agreement to facilitate the nonreference drug filer’s ability to secure and maintain regulatory
8 approval to market the nonreference drug product.
9 (d) An agreement resolving a patent infringement claim in which the reference drug holder
10 forgives the potential damages accrued by a nonreference drug holder for an at-risk launch of the
11 nonreference drug product that is the subject of that claim.
12 (e) Parties to an agreement are not in violation of subsection (a)(1)(i) of this section if they
13 can demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that either of the following are met:
14 (1) The value received by the nonreference drug filer is a fair and reasonable compensation
15 solely for other goods or services that the nonreference drug filer has promised to provide; or
16 (2) The agreement has directly generated procompetitive benefits and the procompetitive
17 benefits of the agreement outweigh the anticompetitive effects of the agreement.
18 (f) In determining whether the parties to the agreement have met their burden under
19 subsection (e) of this section, the factfinder shall not presume any of the following:
20 (1) That entry into the marketplace could not have occurred until the expiration of the
21 relevant patent exclusivity or that the agreement’s provision for entry of the nonreference drug
22 product before the expiration of any patent exclusivity means that the agreement is procompetitive
23 within the meaning of subsection (e) of this section;
24 (2) That any patent is enforceable and infringed by the nonreference drug filer in the
25 absence of a final adjudication binding on the filer of those issues;
26 (3) That the agreement caused no delay in entry of the nonreference drug filer’s drug
27 product because of the lack of federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of that or of
28 another nonreference drug product;
29 (4) That the agreement caused no harm or delay due to the possibility that the nonreference
30 drug filer’s drug product might infringe some patent that has not been asserted against the
31 nonreference drug filer or that is not subject to a final and binding adjudication on that filer as to
32 the patent’s scope, enforceability, and infringement.
33 (5) This subsection shall not be construed to preclude a party from introducing evidence
34 regarding subsections (f)(1) through (f)(4) of this section, inclusive, and shall not be construed to
LC001823 - Page 5 of 8

1 preclude the factfinder from making a determination regarding subsections (f)(1) to (f)(4) of this
2 section, inclusive, based on the full scope of the evidence.
3 (g) In determining whether the parties to the agreement have met their burden under
4 subsection (e)(2) of this section, the factfinder shall presume that the relevant product market is
5 that market consisting of the brand or reference drug of the company alleging patent infringement
6 and the drug product of the nonreference company accused of infringement and any other biological
7 product that is licensed as biosimilar or is an AB-rated generic to the reference product.
8 (h) This section does not modify, impair, limit, or supersede the applicability of chapter 36
9 of title 6 ("antitrust law"), chapter 13 of title 6 ("unfair sales practices"), chapter 13.1 of title 6
10 ("deceptive trade practices"), or the availability of damages or remedies provided therein. This
11 section does not modify, impair, limit, or supersede the right of any drug company applicant to
12 assert claims or counterclaims against any person, under the antitrust laws or other laws relating to
13 unfair competition of the federal antitrust law or state law.
14 (i)(1) Each person that violates or assists in the violation of this section shall forfeit and
15 pay a civil penalty sufficient to deter violations of this section, as follows:
16 (i) If the person who violated this section received any value due to that violation, an
17 amount up to three (3) times the value received by the party that is reasonably attributable to the
18 violation of this section, or twenty million dollars ($20,000,000), whichever is greater;
19 (ii) If the violator has not received anything of value as described in subsection (f)(1)(i) of
20 this section, an amount up to three (3) times the value given to other parties to the agreement
21 reasonably attributable to the violation of this section, or twenty million dollars ($20,000,000),
22 whichever is greater;
23 (iii) For purposes of this section, “reasonably attributable to the violation” shall be
24 determined by Rhode Island’s share of the market for the brand drug at issue in the agreement.
25 (2) Any penalty described herein shall accrue only to the State of Rhode Island and shall
26 be recovered in a civil action brought by the attorney general in its own name, or by any of its
27 attorneys designated by it for that purpose, against any party to an agreement that violates this
28 section.
29 (3) Each party that violates or assists in the violation of this section shall be liable for any
30 damages, penalties, costs, fees, injunctions, or other remedies that may be just and reasonable and
31 available under chapter 36 of title 6 ("antitrust law"), chapter 13 of title 6 ("unfair sales practices"),
32 chapter 13.1 of title 6 ("deceptive trade practices"), as applicable.
33 (4) If the State of Rhode Island is awarded penalties herein, it may not recover penalties
34 pursuant to another law identified in subsection (e)(1) of this section. This section shall not be
LC001823 - Page 6 of 8

1 construed to foreclose the State of Rhode Island’s ability to claim any relief or damages available,
2 other than those that are penalties.
3 (5) An action to enforce a cause of action for a violation of this section shall be commenced
4 within four (4) years after the cause of action accrued.
5 23-25.7-4. Severability.
6 The provisions of this chapter are severable. If any provision of this chapter or its
7 application is held invalid, that invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications that can
8 be given effect without the invalid provision or application.
9 SECTION 2. This act shall take effect upon passage.

EXPLANATION
BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL
OF
A N A C T
RELATING TO HEALTH AND SAFETY -- PRESERVING ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE
DRUGS
***
1 This act would provide that an agreement resolving or settling, on a final or interim basis,
2 a patent infringement claim, in connection with the sale of a pharmaceutical product, is to be
3 presumed to have anticompetitive effects if a nonreference drug filer receives anything of value, as
4 defined, from another company asserting patent infringement and if the nonreference drug filer
5 agrees to limit or forego research, development, manufacturing, marketing, or sales of the
6 nonreference drug filer’s product for any period of time, as specified. The act would provide various
7 exceptions to this prohibition, including, among others, if the agreement has directly generated
8 procompetitive benefits and the procompetitive benefits of the agreement outweigh the
9 anticompetitive effects of the agreement. The act would make a violation of these provisions
10 punishable by a civil penalty that is recoverable only in a civil action brought by the attorney
11 general, as specified.
12 This act would take effect upon passage.
