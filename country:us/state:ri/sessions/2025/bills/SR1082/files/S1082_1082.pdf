Introduced By: Senators Gallo, Lawson, LaMountain, Pearson, Ujifusa, Paolino, Felag,
Zurier, Britto, and Patalano
Date Introduced: May 22, 2025
Referred To: Recommended for Immediate Consideration
1 WHEREAS, People seldom talk about hearing and speech problems, but hearing,
2 language, voice, and speech disorders are serious, treatable conditions that affect an estimated 48
3 million Americans; and
4 WHEREAS, Hearing, language, and speech disorders take many forms: babies can be
5 born with these disorders, or an accidental injury or illness can cause them at any age. Whatever
6 their cause, hearing, language, and speech disorders have serious consequences; and
7 WHEREAS, Hearing, language, and speech disorders can limit academic achievement,
8 social adjustment, and career advancement; and
9 WHEREAS, Audiologists and speech-language pathologists are the professionals who
10 treat all types of hearing, language, speech, and related disorders; and
11 WHEREAS, Hearing, language, speech, and related disorders make it difficult for people
12 to express themselves or to understand the spoken or written word. Anyone of any age can have a
13 communication disorder. Hearing, language, and speech disorders are everybody's problem; and
14 WHEREAS, Audiologists and speech-language pathologists work in schools, private
15 practice, hospitals, clinics, and other health and education settings. They enable and empower
16 individuals with communication disorders to lead independent, productive, and fulfilling lives;
17 now, therefore be it
18 RESOLVED, That this Senate of the State of Rhode Island hereby commemorates May
19 of 2025, as "National Speech - Language - Hearing Month" in the State of Rhode Island, and

1 urges the Department of Human Services to conduct hearing screenings and other special events
2 to remind everyone that now is the best time to listen to sound advice about hearing. We
3 furthermore urge the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to encourage teachers,
4 hearing and speech specialists, principals, supervisors, and all the citizens of this state to
5 participate in this month-long campaign acknowledging the great strides and invaluable services
6 provided by these dedicated teachers and specialists, and to raise public awareness of hearing,
7 language, and speech disorders; and be it further
8 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
9 transmit duly certified copies of this resolution to the Director of the Rhode Island Department of
10 Human Services, the Commissioner of Elementary and Secondary Education for the State of
11 Rhode Island, and the President of the Rhode Island Speech and Language Association.
