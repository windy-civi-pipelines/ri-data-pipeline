SUPPORTING "PERIOD POVERTY AWARENESS WEEK" ON MAY 12-18, 2025, IN THE
STATE OF RHODE ISLAND
Introduced By: Senators Kallman, Lauria, Quezada, Valverde, DiMario, Vargas, Gallo,
Gu, Sosnowski, and Urso
Date Introduced: May 15, 2025
Referred To: Recommended for Immediate Consideration
1 WHEREAS, The United Nations has recognized access to menstrual hygiene and care as
2 a global public health priority and human rights issue; and
3 WHEREAS, In 2019, Rhode Island passed legislation eliminating the tax on period
4 supplies, a step in the right direction; however, there continues to exist negative financial, social,
5 educational, and medical ramifications for many women and girls, particularly those living in
6 poverty; and
7 WHEREAS, More than thirteen percent of Rhode Island women live below the Federal
8 Poverty Line and often struggle to purchase period products due to their or their family’s lack of
9 income; and
10 WHEREAS, In the United States, one in three teenaged young women have missed a
11 class due to a lack of access to adequate period supplies, and two in five menstruators struggle to
12 purchase period products; and
13 WHEREAS, For women and girls who live below the Federal Poverty Line, there is often
14 a no-win choice between paying for food or period products, and has too often resulted in the use
15 of alternate unsanitary practices and products putting their health at risk; and
16 WHEREAS, In addition, during menstruation, women are often forced to disrupt their
17 regular activity, resulting in missed work, missed opportunities, negative effects on their self-
18 esteem, and social stigma; and
19 WHEREAS, Adequate availability, dignity, and justice is deserved and must be inherent

1 to solving Period Poverty and menstrual social stigma in Rhode Island and across the globe; now,
2 therefore be it
3 RESOLVED, That this Senate of the State of Rhode Island hereby memorializes “Period
4 Poverty Awareness Week” on May 12th - 18th, 2025, and supports the global effort to raise
5 awareness about the need for period products to be more accessible and affordable, to break the
6 stigma of menstruation, and efforts to advocate for policy and funding to make these goals a
7 reality; and be it further
8 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
9 transmit duly certified copies of this resolution to Quinn Coleman, Service Director, Period
10 Equity at Brown University, Amenity Aid in Warwick, and the Rhode Island Foundation.
