3 27-9.1-4. “Unfair claims practices” defined. [Effective January 1, 2025.]
4 (a) Any of the following acts by an insurer, if committed in violation of § 27-9.1-3,

19 completed its investigation related to the claim or claims;

5 if the cost to rebuild or reconstruct the motor vehicle to its pre-accident condition is less than
6 seventy-five percent (75%) eighty percent (80%) of the “fair market value” of the motor vehicle
7 immediately preceding the time it was damaged;
8 (iv) If condition adjustments are made to the retail value of a motor vehicle designated a
9 total loss, all such adjustments must be in accordance with the standards set forth in the current
10 edition of a nationally recognized compilation of retail values, commonly used by the automotive
11 industry, used by the insurer to determine the retail value of the vehicle; and all such adjustments,
12 including prior damage deductions, must be itemized, fair, and reasonable; and
13 (v) When a vehicle is deemed a total loss, if the insurer is not retaining the salvage, the

18 dispose of or otherwise retain the salvage;
19 (30) Negotiating, or effecting the settlement of, a claim for loss or damage covered by an

23 (31) Refusing to pay an auto body repair shop for documented necessary sublet services
24 paid out to vendors or incurred by the auto body repair shop, for specialty or unique services

1 the insurer to issue a check or checks payable to the public adjuster for the public adjuster’s fee,
2 but not more than ten percent (10%) of the total amount of the settlement, and a separate check

23 repair program or any similar program thereto, the provisions of subsections (a)(20), (a)(21), and
24 (a)(22) of this section shall not apply.
25 (3) If the insured or claimant elects to have the vehicle repaired at a shop of the insured’s
26 or claimant’s choice, the insurer shall not limit or discount the reasonable repair costs based upon
27 the charges that would have been incurred had the vehicle been repaired by the insurer’s chosen
28 shop(s).
