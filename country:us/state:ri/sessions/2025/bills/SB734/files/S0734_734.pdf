6 As used in this chapter:
7 (1) “Assault weapon” means any weapon which automatically shoots, is designed to shoot,

9 of the trigger. This shall include the frame or receiver of any such weapon, any part designed and
10 intended solely and exclusively, or combination of parts designed and intended for use in
11 converting a weapon into a machinegun, and any combination of parts from which a machine gun
12 can be assembled if the parts are in the possession or under the control of an individual.
13 (2) “Automatically shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot” means

17 dealers license issued pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 923(a).
18 (4) “Machine gun” means any weapon as defined in § 11-47-2(10) and shall include any
19 bump-stock device or similar device or attachment which allows a semi-automatic weapon to shoot

1 more than one shot with a single pull of the trigger by harnessing the recoil energy of the semi-
2 automatic weapon to which it is affixed so that the trigger resets and continues firing without
3 additional physical manipulation of the trigger by the shooter.
4 (5) The term “single function of the trigger” means a single pull of the trigger or an
5 analogous motion.
6 11-47.2-2. Assault weapons prohibited.
7 (a) No person, except for a federally licensed firearm dealer in compliance with federal
8 law, shall manufacture, sell, offer to sell, transfer, purchase, possess, or have under their control an

14 (1) Any law enforcement officer exempt under §§ 11-47-9 and 11-47-9.1;
15 (2) A qualified law enforcement officer under 18 U.S.C. 926 (b)(c) and who is carrying the
16 identification required by 18 U.S.C. 926(B)(d);

20 assault weapon.
21 (c) For purposes of this section, a federally licensed firearm dealer who manufactures, sells,
22 offers to sell, transfers, purchases, possesses, or has under their control an assault weapon shall
23 follow all applicable provisions of 28 U.S.C §5849 and Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms rules and
24 regulations with respect to assault weapons.
