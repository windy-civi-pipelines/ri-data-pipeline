25 to § 40-11-3; or to appropriate law enforcement personnel or the office of healthy aging if the

2 (ii) A healthcare provider may disclose protected health information in response to a law

14 gender, race, hair and eye color, presence or absence of facial hair (beard or moustache), scars, and
15 tattoos.
16 (I) Except as permitted by this subsection, the healthcare provider may not disclose for the
17 purposes of identification or location under this subsection any protected health information related
18 to the patient’s DNA or DNA analysis, dental records, or typing, samples, or analysis of body fluids

20 (iii) A healthcare provider may disclose protected health information in response to a law
21 enforcement official’s request for such information about a patient who is, or is suspected to be, a
22 victim of a crime, other than disclosures that are subject to subsection (b)(4)(vii), if:
23 (A) The patient agrees to the disclosure; or
24 (B) The healthcare provider is unable to obtain the patient’s agreement because of
25 incapacity or other emergency circumstances provided that:
26 (1) The law enforcement official represents that the information is needed to determine
27 whether a violation of law by a person other than the victim has occurred, and such information is
28 not intended to be used against the victim;
29 (2) The law enforcement official represents that immediate law enforcement activity that
30 depends upon the disclosure would be materially and adversely affected by waiting until the patient
31 is able to agree to the disclosure; and
32 (3) The disclosure is in the best interests of the patient as determined by the healthcare
33 provider in the exercise of professional judgment;
34 (iv) A healthcare provider may disclose protected health information about a patient who
LC001364 - Page 3 of 10
1 has died to a law enforcement official for the purpose of alerting law enforcement of the death of
2 the patient if the healthcare provider has a suspicion that such death may have resulted from
3 criminal conduct;
4 (v) A healthcare provider may disclose to a law enforcement official protected health
5 information that the healthcare provider believes in good faith constitutes evidence of criminal
6 conduct that occurred on the premises of the healthcare provider;
7 (vi)(A) A healthcare provider providing emergency health care in response to a medical
8 emergency, other than such emergency on the premises of the covered healthcare provider, may
9 disclose protected health information to a law enforcement official if such disclosure appears
10 necessary to alert law enforcement to:
11 (1) The commission and nature of a crime;
12 (2) The location of such crime or of the victim(s) of such crime; and
13 (3) The identity, description, and location of the perpetrator of such crime.
14 (B) If a healthcare provider believes that the medical emergency described in subsection
15 (b)(4)(vi)(A) is the result of abuse, neglect, or domestic violence of the individual in need of
16 emergency health care, subsection (b)(4)(vi)(A) does not apply and any disclosure to a law
17 enforcement official for law enforcement purposes is subject to subsection (b)(4)(vii);
18 (vii)(A) Except for reports permitted by subsection (b)(4)(i), a healthcare provider may
19 disclose protected health information about a patient the healthcare provider reasonably believes to
20 be a victim of abuse, neglect, or domestic violence to law enforcement or a government authority,
21 including a social-service or protective-services agency, authorized by law to receive reports of
22 such abuse, neglect, or domestic violence:
23 (1) To the extent the disclosure is required by law and the disclosure complies with, and is
24 limited to, the relevant requirements of such law;
25 (2) If the patient agrees to the disclosure; or
26 (3) To the extent the disclosure is expressly authorized by statute or regulation and:
27 (i) The healthcare provider, in the exercise of professional judgment, believes the
28 disclosure is necessary to prevent serious harm to the patient or other potential victims; or
29 (ii) If the patient is unable to agree because of incapacity, a law enforcement or other public
30 official authorized to receive the report represents that the protected health information for which
31 disclosure is sought is not intended to be used against the patient and that an immediate enforcement
32 activity that depends upon the disclosure would be materially and adversely affected by waiting
33 until the patient is able to agree to the disclosure.
34 (B) A healthcare provider that makes a disclosure permitted by subsection (b)(4)(vii)(A)
LC001364 - Page 4 of 10
1 must promptly inform the patient that such a report has been, or will be, made, except if:
2 (1) The healthcare facility, in the exercise of professional judgment, believes informing the
3 patient would place the individual at risk of serious harm; or
4 (2) The healthcare provider would be informing a personal representative, and the
5 healthcare provider reasonably believes the personal representative is responsible for the abuse,
6 neglect, or other injury, and that informing such person would not be in the best interests of the
7 individual as determined by the covered entity in the exercise of professional judgment;
8 (viii) The disclosures authorized by this subsection shall be limited to the minimum amount
9 of information necessary to accomplish the intended purpose of the release of information;
10 (ix) If any staff member of the department of behavioral healthcare, developmental
11 disabilities and hospitals (BHDDH) who is authorized by its director makes a written demand for
12 records pursuant to either chapter 5, 24, 24.5, 26 or 27 of title 40.1 for any of the organization's or
13 client's or patient's records while BHDDH is investigating an alleged incident of abuse, neglect,
14 mistreatment, exploitation, death, or other violation of rights of an individual who has received or
15 is receiving services from either a facility or program subject to chapter 5 of title 40.1 ("mental
16 health law") or an organization licensed by BHDDH, the records identified in such written demand
17 for records shall be immediately produced to BHDDH; provided, however, that:
18 (A) The BHDDH written demand for records shall include notice that BHDDH has opened
19 an investigation with regard to abuse, neglect, mistreatment, exploitation, death, or violation of
20 rights of a patient or client of the facility, program or organization, and the notice shall include the
21 patient's or client's name if BHDDH is aware of the name.
22 (B) If the recipient of the written demand for records fails to comply, BHDDH may file in
23 the superior court a petition for writ of mandamus or similar petition for the records requested in
24 the written demand for records.
25 (C) For purposes of this section, BHDDH is designated as a health oversight agency as the
26 term is used in 42 CFR S 164.512, and is designated as both a social-service agency and protective
27 services agency as those terms are used in this section.
28 (5) Between, or among, qualified personnel and healthcare providers within the healthcare
29 system for purposes of coordination of healthcare services given to the patient and for purposes of

21 enforcement official’s request for such information about a patient who is, or is suspected to be, a
22 victim of a crime, other than disclosures that are subject to subsection (b)(4)(vii), if:
23 (A) The patient agrees to the disclosure; or
24 (B) The healthcare provider is unable to obtain the patient’s agreement because of
25 incapacity or other emergency circumstances provided that:
26 (1) The law enforcement official represents that the information is needed to determine
27 whether a violation of law by a person other than the victim has occurred, and such information is
28 not intended to be used against the victim;
29 (2) The law enforcement official represents that immediate law enforcement activity that
30 depends upon the disclosure would be materially and adversely affected by waiting until the patient
31 is able to agree to the disclosure; and
32 (3) The disclosure is in the best interests of the patient as determined by the healthcare
33 provider in the exercise of professional judgment;
34 (iv) A healthcare provider may disclose protected health information about a patient who
LC001364 - Page 3 of 10

1 has died to a law enforcement official for the purpose of alerting law enforcement of the death of
2 the patient if the healthcare provider has a suspicion that such death may have resulted from
3 criminal conduct;
4 (v) A healthcare provider may disclose to a law enforcement official protected health
5 information that the healthcare provider believes in good faith constitutes evidence of criminal
6 conduct that occurred on the premises of the healthcare provider;
7 (vi)(A) A healthcare provider providing emergency health care in response to a medical
8 emergency, other than such emergency on the premises of the covered healthcare provider, may
9 disclose protected health information to a law enforcement official if such disclosure appears
10 necessary to alert law enforcement to:
11 (1) The commission and nature of a crime;
12 (2) The location of such crime or of the victim(s) of such crime; and
13 (3) The identity, description, and location of the perpetrator of such crime.
14 (B) If a healthcare provider believes that the medical emergency described in subsection
15 (b)(4)(vi)(A) is the result of abuse, neglect, or domestic violence of the individual in need of
16 emergency health care, subsection (b)(4)(vi)(A) does not apply and any disclosure to a law
17 enforcement official for law enforcement purposes is subject to subsection (b)(4)(vii);
18 (vii)(A) Except for reports permitted by subsection (b)(4)(i), a healthcare provider may
19 disclose protected health information about a patient the healthcare provider reasonably believes to
20 be a victim of abuse, neglect, or domestic violence to law enforcement or a government authority,
21 including a social-service or protective-services agency, authorized by law to receive reports of
22 such abuse, neglect, or domestic violence:
23 (1) To the extent the disclosure is required by law and the disclosure complies with, and is
24 limited to, the relevant requirements of such law;
25 (2) If the patient agrees to the disclosure; or
26 (3) To the extent the disclosure is expressly authorized by statute or regulation and:
27 (i) The healthcare provider, in the exercise of professional judgment, believes the
28 disclosure is necessary to prevent serious harm to the patient or other potential victims; or
29 (ii) If the patient is unable to agree because of incapacity, a law enforcement or other public
30 official authorized to receive the report represents that the protected health information for which
31 disclosure is sought is not intended to be used against the patient and that an immediate enforcement
32 activity that depends upon the disclosure would be materially and adversely affected by waiting
33 until the patient is able to agree to the disclosure.
34 (B) A healthcare provider that makes a disclosure permitted by subsection (b)(4)(vii)(A)
LC001364 - Page 4 of 10

1 must promptly inform the patient that such a report has been, or will be, made, except if:
2 (1) The healthcare facility, in the exercise of professional judgment, believes informing the
3 patient would place the individual at risk of serious harm; or
4 (2) The healthcare provider would be informing a personal representative, and the
5 healthcare provider reasonably believes the personal representative is responsible for the abuse,
6 neglect, or other injury, and that informing such person would not be in the best interests of the
7 individual as determined by the covered entity in the exercise of professional judgment;
8 (viii) The disclosures authorized by this subsection shall be limited to the minimum amount
9 of information necessary to accomplish the intended purpose of the release of information;
10 (ix) If any staff member of the department of behavioral healthcare, developmental

15 is receiving services from either a facility or program subject to chapter 5 of title 40.1 ("mental
16 health law") or an organization licensed by BHDDH, the records identified in such written demand
17 for records shall be immediately produced to BHDDH; provided, however, that:
18 (A) The BHDDH written demand for records shall include notice that BHDDH has opened
19 an investigation with regard to abuse, neglect, mistreatment, exploitation, death, or violation of
20 rights of a patient or client of the facility, program or organization, and the notice shall include the
21 patient's or client's name if BHDDH is aware of the name.
22 (B) If the recipient of the written demand for records fails to comply, BHDDH may file in
23 the superior court a petition for writ of mandamus or similar petition for the records requested in
24 the written demand for records.
25 (C) For purposes of this section, BHDDH is designated as a health oversight agency as the
26 term is used in 42 CFR S 164.512, and is designated as both a social-service agency and protective
27 services agency as those terms are used in this section.
