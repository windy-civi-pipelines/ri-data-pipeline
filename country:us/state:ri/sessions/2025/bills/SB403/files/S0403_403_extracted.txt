5 21-13.1-1. Legislative intent.
6 The general assembly recognizes it is in the public interest to protect the public health and

15 or town where the violation occurs, or by the state department of health, and the municipality or
16 department of health, after deducting the costs of trial and conviction, may retain the balance of the
17 fine or fines recovered for the use of the municipality or department.
