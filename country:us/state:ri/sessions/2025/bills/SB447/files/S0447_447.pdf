RELATING TO TAXATION -- PERSONAL INCOME TAX -- CHILD TAX CREDIT
Introduced By: Senators Vargas, Lawson, DiPalma, Murray, Acosta, Gu, Appollonio,
and Britto
Date Introduced: February 26, 2025
Referred To: Senate Finance
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Findings of fact.
2 (1) The health and wellbeing of Rhode Island children and their families are critical to the
3 future of our state;
4 (2) Children, youth, and their caregivers are experiencing challenges exacerbated by the
5 pandemic leading to increasing educational, behavioral health crises, as well as inflationary
6 pressures exacerbating homelessness, and food insecurity;
7 (3) Research has shown that child tax credits contribute to promotion of work, reduction
8 of poverty, and enhanced child development;
9 (4) Research has shown that child tax credits are associated with reductions in family
10 stressors and state-level maltreatment reports;
11 (5) Research has shown that child tax credit income is used to supplement basic household
12 needs and children's essentials;
13 (6) Fourteen states including Massachusetts have child tax credits and other states have
14 pending proposals in their state legislatures, including Connecticut. According to research by the
15 Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a combination of the existing federal child tax credit
16 and a state credit would slash child poverty rates.
17 SECTION 2. Section 44-30-2 of the General Laws in Chapter 44-30 entitled "Personal
18 Income Tax" is hereby amended to read as follows:

11 ($5.00), or ten dollars ($10.00) if married and filing a joint return, to the account for the public
12 financing of the electoral system. The first two dollars ($2.00), or four dollars ($4.00) if married
13 and filing a joint return, shall go to a political party as defined in § 17-12.1-12 to be designated by
14 the taxpayer or to a nonpartisan account if so indicated up to a total of two hundred thousand dollars
15 ($200,000) collectively for all parties and the nonpartisan account. The remainder shall be
16 deposited as general revenue.
17 (2) The credit for the public financing of the electoral system shall appear on the face of

21 party and the contributions made to the nonpartisan general account shall be allocated by the state

23 candidates for governor received in the previous election, after five percent (5%) of the amount in
24 the account is allocated to each party for each general officer elected in the previous statewide
25 election. Each political party may expend moneys received under this provision for all purposes
26 and activities permitted by the laws of Rhode Island and the United States, except that no such
27 moneys shall be utilized for expenditures to be directly made or incurred to support or defeat a
28 candidate in any election within the meaning of chapter 25 of title 17, or in any election for any
29 political party nomination, or for political party office within the meaning of chapter 12 of title 17.

31 forth in §§ 17-25-19 — 17-25-27.
32 (3) Child tax credit. A taxpayer that maintains a household that includes at least one
33 individual up to age eighteen (18) years, who qualifies as a dependent, as defined in section 26 U.S.
34 Code § 152, shall be allowed a tax credit for each such dependent, to be computed as provided in
LC000546 - Page 6 of 8

1 this chapter, against the tax imposed by chapters 30 of this title. The amount of the credit shall be:
2 (i) For dependent(s) up to age eighteen (18) a tax credit of one thousand dollars ($1,000)
3 shall be allowed per dependent;
4 (ii) No credit shall be allowed pursuant to this chapter unless the taxpayer claiming said
5 child tax credit has a total income for the taxable year that does not exceed one hundred thousand
6 dollars ($100,000) for a single-filer household and one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000)
7 for a dual-filer household.
8 (iii) If the amount of the credit allowed under this section exceeds the taxpayer’s tax
9 liability, the division of taxation shall treat the excess as an overpayment and shall pay the taxpayer
10 the entire amount of the excess.
11 (e) Tax adjustment.
12 (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, for taxable years
13 ending after December 31, 1980, in the event that during a period when the general assembly is not
14 in session a change is made in the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of the United States and
15 amendments thereto, or other provisions of the law of the United States relating to federal income
16 taxes, or the rules and regulations issued under these laws that alters the taxpayer’s federal income
17 tax liability, the tax administrator is directed to so change the Rhode Island personal income tax
18 rate of the taxpayer's federal income tax liability as to retain the tax product upon receipt of which
19 state appropriations were predicated.
20 (2) The rate so set by the tax administrator will be effective until such time as the general
21 assembly shall ratify this rate or set a different rate.
22 SECTION 3. This act shall take effect upon passage.
