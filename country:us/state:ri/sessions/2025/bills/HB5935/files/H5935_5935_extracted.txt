***
1 This act would allow the attorney general to enter in agreements with other states to
2 recognize a concealed handgun permit as valid. This act would authorize the State of Rhode Island
3 to recognize and honor a concealed weapon permit from out of state provided the license holder is
4 twenty-one (21) years of age or older, the reciprocal state or county provides a means of twenty-
5 four (24) hours instantaneous verification. Further, any active duty law enforcement officers having
6 a government issued identification card would have the right to carry a concealed firearm within
7 the State of Rhode Island. Additionally, this act would define "suitable person" for purposes of
8 possessing and having a concealed carry pistol permit and would establish reasons for applying for
9 a carry permit for both in-state and out-of-state residents. This act would also set forth what
10 information is required on applications for carry permits, establish an appeal process when an
11 application is denied and provide that records relating to carry permits and appeals would not be a
12 public record.
13 This act would take effect upon passage.

EXPLANATION
BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL
OF
A N A C T
RELATING TO CRIMINAL OFFENSES -- WEAPONS -- CONCEALED CARRY REFORM
***
1 This act would allow the attorney general to enter in agreements with other states to
2 recognize a concealed handgun permit as valid. This act would authorize the State of Rhode Island
3 to recognize and honor a concealed weapon permit from out of state provided the license holder is
4 twenty-one (21) years of age or older, the reciprocal state or county provides a means of twenty-
5 four (24) hours instantaneous verification. Further, any active duty law enforcement officers having
6 a government issued identification card would have the right to carry a concealed firearm within
7 the State of Rhode Island. Additionally, this act would define "suitable person" for purposes of
8 possessing and having a concealed carry pistol permit and would establish reasons for applying for
9 a carry permit for both in-state and out-of-state residents. This act would also set forth what
10 information is required on applications for carry permits, establish an appeal process when an
11 application is denied and provide that records relating to carry permits and appeals would not be a
12 public record.
13 This act would take effect upon passage.
