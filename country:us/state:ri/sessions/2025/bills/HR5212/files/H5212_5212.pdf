MAZZULLA ON WINNING THE 2024 NBA CHAMPIONSHIP
Introduced By: Representatives Shekarchi, Blazejewski, Fellela, Serpa, Costantino,
O'Brien, Hull, Solomon, Messier, and Chippendale
Date Introduced: January 28, 2025
Referred To: House read and passed
1 WHEREAS, The Boston Celtics, thanks to the sterling leadership and outstanding
2 coaching provided by Head Coach Joe Mazzulla, won a record-setting eighteenth NBA
3 championship in 2024; and
4 WHEREAS, Joe Mazzulla was born in Johnston and attended Bishop Hendricken High
5 School where he excelled at basketball, leading Hendricken to three Rhode Island State Titles,
6 with the last one taking place during his senior season when he hit a clutch last second shot to win
7 the championship; and
8 WHEREAS, After graduating from high school, Joe accepted a basketball scholarship
9 offer from the University of West Virginia, where he once again excelled on the court and led his
10 team to success at the highest levels, which included winning the 2002 National Invitation
11 Tournament, a second-round NCAA upset victory over a powerhouse Duke team, and a NCAA
12 Final Four appearance in his senior season which included a thrilling Elite Eight victory over a
13 loaded Kentucky Wildcats team. As a testament to the respect he earned from his teammates and
14 the coaching staff at West Virginia, he was selected to serve as the Captain of the West Virginia
15 Basketball team in his final season of NCAA competition; and
16 WHEREAS, After graduating from college, Joe entered the coaching profession, a
17 natural career path for someone of his character and vast leadership skills. He served as an
18 Assistant Coach at Glenville State, Fairmont State, and with the Maine Red Claws of the NBA G
19 League before he was named the Head Coach of Fairmont State in 2017. In his second season as

1 the Head Coach of Fairmont State, Coach Mazzulla led them to an appearance in the 2019 NCAA
2 Division II Tournament; and
3 WHEREAS, In 2019, Coach Mazzulla was hired to serve as an Assistant Coach with the
4 Boston Celtics. Two years later, on September 22, 2022, he was named the Interim Head Coach
5 of the Boston Celtics, where he immediately proceeded to impress the entire league with his
6 coaching acumen, amazing leadership abilities and superb play calling. Coach Mazzulla was
7 named the Eastern Conference Coach of the Month for October and November of 2022 and was
8 named the official Boston Celtics Head Coach on January 30, 2023. Coach Mazzulla proceeded
9 to lead the Celtics to an outstanding 57-15 record and a first-place finish in the Atlantic Division
10 as the Celtics reached the Eastern Conference Finals. Bigger things were yet to come during the
11 next NBA season; and
12 WHEREAS, In the 2023-2024 NBA season, Coach Mazzulla led the Boston Celtics to
13 the best record in the NBA with an outstanding 64-18 record, seven games better than the second-
14 best record in the NBA. Under his guidance, Jayson Tatum earned First-Team All-NBA honors,
15 and earned a selection to the All-Star game with teammate Jaylen Brown, with Jrue Holiday and
16 Derrick White earning NBA Second-Team All-Defensive Honors. Once again, Coach Mazzulla
17 earned Eastern Conference Coach of the Month awards, this time for December of 2023 and
18 March of 2024; and
19 WHEREAS, As good as the Celtics were in the regular season, they were even better in
20 the NBA playoffs. The team easily defeated bitter rival the Miami Heat, 4-1 in the first round of
21 the NBA playoffs. The Celtics then proceeded to quickly dispatch the Cleveland Cavaliers 4-1 in
22 the next round, and then swept the Indiana Pacers 4-0 in the Eastern Conference Finals to reach
23 the NBA Finals, where they faced the Dallas Mavericks and their phenom point guard, Luka
24 Dončić. In a highly anticipated NBA Finals, many were questioning whether the Celtics could
25 contain Dončić and the Mavericks high-powered offense, but the Celtics answered the call as they
26 dominated the series, holding Dallas to under 100 points in four of the five games as the Celtics
27 won The Finals series 4-1, earning an NBA record-setting 18th NBA Championship. Coach
28 Mazzulla also became the youngest coach to win an NBA Championship since Bill Russell in
29 1969, also for the Celtics; and
30 WHEREAS, Coach Mazzulla recently returned to Rhode Island on September 3, 2024,
31 visiting the State House with the championship trophy to celebrate his success with his family
32 and many friends as well as the many fans of the Boston Celtics located in our state. Coach
33 Mazzulla graciously thanked the people of Rhode Island for "contributing to the village that
34 helped raise him", and went on to talk about all the locals he bumped into on his return visit to
