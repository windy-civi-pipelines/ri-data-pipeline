14 and school librarians foster a love of reading and a love of learning that enables students to become
15 life-long learners.
16 (2) School libraries and school librarians are essential in the instruction of information
17 literacy and media literacy in the age of limitless information sources, social media, misinformation
18 and disinformation. School librarians teach students to identify, evaluate and use information in

3 databases, and technology vetted by school librarians. Library programs provide equitable
4 opportunity for all students to be able to read, locate, evaluate and interpret information accurately
5 for academic and professional success.
6 (4) Research consistently demonstrates that in schools with well-equipped and well-
7 stocked school libraries staffed by certified school librarians, students achieve higher scores on
