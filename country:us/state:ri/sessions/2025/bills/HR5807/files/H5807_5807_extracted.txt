15 Georgia. This program allowed Marines to volunteer their time helping children in primary,
16 secondary, and post-secondary schools within their communities. Dr. Parillon’s innovative work
17 with Mentors in Action earned her the honor of receiving Albany, Georgia’s, Forty Under 40
18 Award; and

1 notable keynote addresses and has served as a moderator at numerous public and private events.
