8 or both. For purposes of this section, a “child” is defined as any person who has not attained the
9 age of eighteen (18) years.
10 (d) A person is guilty of criminal storage of a firearm in the first degree if they commit the
11 crime of criminal storage in the second degree and the firearm obtained by a child or a person who

31 (f)(1) If the person who allegedly violated this section is the parent or guardian of a child
32 who is injured or who dies as the result of an accidental shooting, the attorney general shall consider
