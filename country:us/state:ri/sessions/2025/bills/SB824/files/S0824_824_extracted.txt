5 business has shared or sold the consumer health data and an active email address or other online
6 mechanism that the consumer may use to contact these third parties.
7 (2) A consumer has the right to withdraw consent from the regulated entity's or the small
8 business's collection and sharing of consumer health data concerning the consumer.
9 (3) A consumer has the right to have consumer health data concerning the consumer deleted
10 and may exercise that right by informing the regulated entity or the small business of the consumer's
11 request for deletion.
12 (i) A regulated entity or a small business that receives a consumer's request to delete any
13 consumer health data concerning the consumer shall:
14 (A) Delete the consumer health data from its records, including from all parts of the
15 regulated entity's or the small business's network, including archived or backup systems pursuant
16 subsection (a)(3)(B)(iii) of this section; and
17 (B) Notify all affiliates, processors, contractors, and other third parties with whom the
18 regulated entity or the small business has shared consumer health data of the deletion request.
19 (ii) All affiliates, processors, contractors, and other third parties that receive notice of a
20 consumer's deletion request shall honor the consumer's deletion request and delete the consumer
21 health data from its records, subject to the requirements of this chapter.
22 (iii) If consumer health data that a consumer requests to be deleted is stored on archived or
23 backup systems, then the request for deletion may be delayed to enable restoration of the archived
24 or backup systems; provided that, such delay may not exceed six (6) months from authenticating
25 the deletion request.
26 (4) A consumer may exercise the rights set forth in this chapter by submitting a request, at
27 any time, to a regulated entity or a small business. Such a request may be made by a secure and
28 reliable means established by the regulated entity or the small business and described in its
29 consumer health data privacy policy. The method shall take into account the ways in which
30 consumers normally interact with the regulated entity or the small business, the need for secure and
31 reliable communication of such requests, and the ability of the regulated entity or the small business
32 to authenticate the identity of the consumer making the request. A regulated entity or a small
33 business shall not require a consumer to create a new account in order to exercise consumer rights
34 pursuant to this chapter but may require a consumer to use an existing account.

1 (5) If a regulated entity or a small business is unable to authenticate the request using

4 provide additional information reasonably necessary to authenticate the consumer and the
5 consumer's request.
6 (6) Information provided in response to a consumer request shall be provided by a regulated
7 entity and a small business free of charge, up to twice annually per consumer. If requests from a
8 consumer are manifestly unfounded, excessive, or repetitive, the regulated entity or the small
9 business may charge the consumer a reasonable fee to cover the administrative costs of complying
10 with the request or decline to act on the request. The regulated entity and the small business bear
11 the burden of demonstrating the manifestly unfounded, excessive, or repetitive nature of the
12 request.
13 (7) A regulated entity and a small business shall comply with the consumer's requests under
14 subsection (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the request
15 submitted pursuant to the methods described in this section. A regulated entity and a small business
16 shall promptly take steps to authenticate a consumer request, but this does not extend the regulated
17 entity's and the small business's duty to comply with the consumer's request within forty-five (45)
18 days of receipt of the consumer's request. The response period may be extended once by forty-five
19 (45) additional days when reasonably necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of
20 the consumer's requests, so long as the regulated entity or the small business informs the consumer
21 of any such extension within the initial forty-five (45)-day response period, together with the reason
22 for the extension.
23 (b) A regulated entity shall comply with this section by January 1, 2026, and a small
24 business shall comply with this section beginning April 1, 2026.

30 necessary to provide a product or service that the consumer to whom such consumer health data
31 relates has requested from such regulated entity or small business; and
32 (2) Establish, implement, and maintain administrative, technical, and physical data security
33 practices that, at a minimum, satisfy reasonable standard of care within the regulated entity's or the

14 or processes consumer health data in a manner that is outside the scope of the processor's contract
15 with the regulated entity or the small business, the processor is considered a regulated entity or a

LC002361 - Page 9 of 17

1 23-101.1-5. Consumer rights and requests -- Refusal -- Appeal.
2 (a)(1) A consumer has the right to confirm whether a regulated entity or a small business
3 is collecting, sharing, or selling consumer health data concerning the consumer and to access such
4 data, including a list of all third parties and affiliates with whom the regulated entity or the small
5 business has shared or sold the consumer health data and an active email address or other online
6 mechanism that the consumer may use to contact these third parties.
7 (2) A consumer has the right to withdraw consent from the regulated entity's or the small
8 business's collection and sharing of consumer health data concerning the consumer.
9 (3) A consumer has the right to have consumer health data concerning the consumer deleted
10 and may exercise that right by informing the regulated entity or the small business of the consumer's
11 request for deletion.
12 (i) A regulated entity or a small business that receives a consumer's request to delete any
13 consumer health data concerning the consumer shall:
14 (A) Delete the consumer health data from its records, including from all parts of the
15 regulated entity's or the small business's network, including archived or backup systems pursuant
16 subsection (a)(3)(B)(iii) of this section; and
17 (B) Notify all affiliates, processors, contractors, and other third parties with whom the
18 regulated entity or the small business has shared consumer health data of the deletion request.
19 (ii) All affiliates, processors, contractors, and other third parties that receive notice of a
20 consumer's deletion request shall honor the consumer's deletion request and delete the consumer
21 health data from its records, subject to the requirements of this chapter.
22 (iii) If consumer health data that a consumer requests to be deleted is stored on archived or
23 backup systems, then the request for deletion may be delayed to enable restoration of the archived
24 or backup systems; provided that, such delay may not exceed six (6) months from authenticating
25 the deletion request.
26 (4) A consumer may exercise the rights set forth in this chapter by submitting a request, at
27 any time, to a regulated entity or a small business. Such a request may be made by a secure and
28 reliable means established by the regulated entity or the small business and described in its
29 consumer health data privacy policy. The method shall take into account the ways in which
30 consumers normally interact with the regulated entity or the small business, the need for secure and
31 reliable communication of such requests, and the ability of the regulated entity or the small business
32 to authenticate the identity of the consumer making the request. A regulated entity or a small
33 business shall not require a consumer to create a new account in order to exercise consumer rights
34 pursuant to this chapter but may require a consumer to use an existing account.
LC002361 - Page 10 of 17

1 (5) If a regulated entity or a small business is unable to authenticate the request using
2 commercially reasonable efforts, the regulated entity or the small business shall not be required to
3 comply with a request to initiate an action under this section and may request that the consumer
4 provide additional information reasonably necessary to authenticate the consumer and the
5 consumer's request.
6 (6) Information provided in response to a consumer request shall be provided by a regulated
7 entity and a small business free of charge, up to twice annually per consumer. If requests from a
8 consumer are manifestly unfounded, excessive, or repetitive, the regulated entity or the small
9 business may charge the consumer a reasonable fee to cover the administrative costs of complying
10 with the request or decline to act on the request. The regulated entity and the small business bear
11 the burden of demonstrating the manifestly unfounded, excessive, or repetitive nature of the
12 request.
13 (7) A regulated entity and a small business shall comply with the consumer's requests under
14 subsection (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the request
15 submitted pursuant to the methods described in this section. A regulated entity and a small business
16 shall promptly take steps to authenticate a consumer request, but this does not extend the regulated
17 entity's and the small business's duty to comply with the consumer's request within forty-five (45)
18 days of receipt of the consumer's request. The response period may be extended once by forty-five
19 (45) additional days when reasonably necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of
20 the consumer's requests, so long as the regulated entity or the small business informs the consumer
21 of any such extension within the initial forty-five (45)-day response period, together with the reason
22 for the extension.
23 (b) A regulated entity shall comply with this section by January 1, 2026, and a small
24 business shall comply with this section beginning April 1, 2026.
25 23-101.1-6. Data security practices.
26 A regulated entity, by January 1, 2026, and a small business, by April 1, 2026, shall:
27 (1) Restrict access to consumer health data by the employees, processors, and contractors
28 of such regulated entity or small business to only those employees, processors, and contractors for
29 which access is necessary to further the purposes for which the consumer provided consent or where
30 necessary to provide a product or service that the consumer to whom such consumer health data
31 relates has requested from such regulated entity or small business; and
32 (2) Establish, implement, and maintain administrative, technical, and physical data security
33 practices that, at a minimum, satisfy reasonable standard of care within the regulated entity's or the
34 small business's industry to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of consumer
LC002361 - Page 11 of 17

1 health data appropriate to the volume and nature of the consumer health data at issue.
2 23-101.1-7. Processors.
3 (a)(1) Effective January 1, 2026 for a regulated entity, and April 1, 2026 for a small
4 business, a processor may process consumer health data only pursuant to a binding contract
5 between the processor and the regulated entity or the small business that sets forth the processing
6 instructions and limit the actions the processor may take with respect to the consumer health data
7 it processes on behalf of the regulated entity or the small business.
8 (2) A processor may process consumer health data only in a manner that is consistent with
9 the binding instructions set forth in the contract with the regulated entity or the small business.
10 (b) A processor shall assist the regulated entity or the small business by appropriate
11 technical and organizational measures, insofar as this is possible, in fulfilling the regulated entity's
12 and the small business's obligations under this chapter.
13 (c) If a processor fails to adhere to the regulated entity's or the small business's instructions
14 or processes consumer health data in a manner that is outside the scope of the processor's contract
15 with the regulated entity or the small business, the processor is considered a regulated entity or a
16 small business with regard to such data and is subject to all the requirements of this chapter with
17 regard to such data.
18 23-101.1-8. Valid authorization to sell -- Defects -- Provision to consumer.
19 (a) Subject to the requirements of § 23-101.1-4, by January 1, 2026 for a regulated entity
20 and April 1, 2026 for a small business, it is unlawful for any person to sell or offer to sell consumer
21 health data concerning a consumer without first obtaining valid authorization from the consumer.
22 The sale of consumer health data shall be consistent with the valid authorization signed by the
23 consumer. This authorization shall be separate and distinct from the consent obtained to collect or
24 share consumer health data, as required under § 23-101.1-4.
25 (b) A valid authorization to sell consumer health data is a document consistent with this
26 section and shall be written in plain language. The valid authorization to sell consumer health data
27 shall contain the following:
28 (1) The specific consumer health data concerning the consumer that the person intends to
29 sell;
30 (2) The name and contact information of the person collecting and selling the consumer
31 health data;
32 (3) The name and contact information of the person purchasing the consumer health data
33 from the seller identified in subsection (b)(2) of this section;
34 (4) A description of the purpose for the sale, including how the consumer health data shall
LC002361 - Page 12 of 17

1 be gathered and how it will be used by the purchaser identified in subsection (b)(3) of this section
2 when sold;
3 (5) A statement that the provision of goods or services may not be conditioned on the
4 consumer signing the valid authorization;
5 (6) A statement that the consumer has a right to revoke the valid authorization at any time
6 and a description on how to submit a revocation of the valid authorization;
7 (7) A statement that the consumer health data sold pursuant to the valid authorization may
8 be subject to redisclosure by the purchaser and may no longer be protected by this section;
9 (8) An expiration date for the valid authorization that expires one year from when the
10 consumer signs the valid authorization; and
11 (9) The signature of the consumer and date.
12 (c) An authorization is not valid if the document has any of the following defects:
13 (i) The expiration date has passed;
14 (ii) The authorization does not contain all the information required under this section;
15 (iii) The authorization has been revoked by the consumer;
16 (iv) The authorization has been combined with other documents to create a compound
17 authorization; or
18 (v) The provision of goods or services is conditioned on the consumer signing the
19 authorization.
20 (d) A copy of the signed valid authorization shall be provided to the consumer.
21 (e) The seller and purchaser of consumer health data shall retain a copy of all valid
22 authorizations for sale of consumer health data for six (6) years from the date of its signature or the
23 date when it was last in effect, whichever is later.
24 23-101.1-10. Geofence restrictions.
25 It is unlawful for any person to implement a geofence around an entity that provides in-
26 person health care services where such geofence is used to:
27 (1) Identify or track consumers seeking health care services; or,
28 (2) Collect consumer health data from consumers.
29 23-101.1-11. Application of consumer protection act.
30 The legislature finds that the practices covered by this chapter are matters vitally affecting
31 the public interest for the purpose of applying chapter 13.1 of title 6. A violation of this chapter is
32 not reasonable in relation to the development and preservation of business, and is an unfair or
33 deceptive act in trade or commerce and an unfair method of competition for the purpose of applying
34 chapter 13.1 of title 6.
