9 As used in this chapter:
10 (1) "Artificial intelligence" means:
11 (i) An artificial system that:
12 (A) Performs tasks under varying and unpredictable circumstances without significant
13 human oversight or can learn from experience and improve such performance when exposed to
14 data sets;
15 (B) Is developed in any context, including, but not limited to, software or physical

17 communication or physical action; or
18 (C) Is designed to:

1 (I) Think or act like a human, including, but not limited to, a cognitive architecture or
2 neural network; or
3 (II) Act rationally, including, but not limited to, an intelligent software agent or embodied
4 robot that achieves goals using perception, planning, reasoning, learning, communication, decision-
5 making or action; or
6 (ii) A set of techniques, including, but not limited to, machine learning, that is designed to
7 approximate a cognitive task.
8 (2) "State agency" means any office, department, board, commission, bureau, division,
9 authority, or public corporation, agency or instrumentality of the state, including all branches of
10 the judiciary.
11 42-167-3. Artificial intelligence inventory.

21 (2) The department of administration shall make each inventory conducted pursuant to this
22 section publicly available on the state's open data portal.
23 (b) Beginning on February 1, 2027, the department of administration shall perform ongoing
