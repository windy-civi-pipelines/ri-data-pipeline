Introduced By: Representatives Shekarchi, Blazejewski, McNamara, Chippendale,
Ackerman, Solomon, Fogarty, Tanzi, Shallcross Smith, and Ajello
Date Introduced: January 23, 2025
Referred To: House read and passed
1 WHEREAS, It is with sadness that this House has learned of the passing of Alan Shawn
2 Feinstein, a champion for education and a renowned philanthropist. He was the beloved husband
3 of Pratarnporn (Chiemwichit) Feinstein, M.D. for sixty-one years, the devoted father of Leila
4 Feinstein and the late Richard and Ari Feinstein, and the very proud grandfather of Louis and
5 Arielle Feinstein, Chaya, Sakai and Desmond Forman; and
6 WHEREAS, Born in Milton, Massachusetts, Mr. Feinstein was the son of Louis and
7 Lillian Feinstein. He grew up in Dorchester and was the brother of the late Joel Feinstein and
8 Sandra Gamm, and the uncle of several nieces and nephews. He graduated from Boston
9 University, where he studied economics and journalism, and later attended Boston Teachers'
10 College at night and taught elementary and junior high school in Massachusetts and Rhode
11 Island; and
12 WHEREAS, In the 1960s, the Feinstein's moved to Rhode Island, making their home in
13 the City of Cranston. In addition to writing various newsletters and booklets, a successful
14 financial guide, a news column, a novel and several children’s books, he began to build his
15 wealth through the selling of various collectibles; and
16 WHEREAS, By the 1980s, Mr. Feinstein had become engrossed with the belief that “No
17 one should ever go hungry”, which led to his association with Brown University’s World Hunger
18 Program, a research and teaching center dedicated to studying the causes of and possible
19 solutions to hunger, which later moved to Tufts University. In 1991, he established the Feinstein
1 Foundation, which encouraged elementary through college students to do good deeds and help
2 those in need; and
3 WHEREAS, By 2008, more than 125,000 children were recognized as Feinstein Junior
4 Scholars for promising to do good deeds for others, and since its inception in 1996, the annual
5 "Feinstein Challenge" has raised over $2.5 billion for local school students, programs, and
6 organizations supporting the campaign to fight hunger; and
7 WHEREAS, Throughout his lifetime, Mr. Feinstein was honored with myriad awards
8 including, the Distinguished Services Award from the American History Society, the Longfellow
9 Humanitarian Award from the American Red Cross, was named Rhode Island Citizen of the Year
10 by the March of Dimes, was awarded the President's Medal at both Rhode Island College and
11 Brown University, and was named to the Rhode Island Hall of Fame. In addition, he has been
12 awarded numerous honorary doctorates, and has had several schools named in his honor
13 including the Feinstein High School in Providence, and most recently, the Alan Shawn Feinstein
14 Middle School in Coventry; and
15 WHEREAS, There is no doubt that Alan Shawn Feinstein, a steadfast gentleman, earned
16 the unqualified admiration and respect of all who were privileged to have known him, and his
17 integrity and generosity enriched the lives of generations of Rhode Islanders, and set a standard
18 for excellence in altruistic service that is an inspiration to us all; now, therefore be it
19 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
20 extends deepest sympathy and condolences to the family of Alan Shawn Feinstein. May his
21 memory be a blessing; and be it further
22 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
23 transmit duly certified copies of this resolution to Pratarnporn (Chiemwichit) Feinstein, M.D., and
24 Leila Feinstein and family.
