Introduced By: Representatives J. Lombardi, Hull, Ajello, and Felix
Date Introduced: January 22, 2025
Referred To: House Education
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Chapter 16-22 of the General Laws entitled "Curriculum [See Title 16
2 Chapter 97 - The Rhode Island Board of Education Act]" is hereby amended by adding thereto the
3 following sections:
4 16-22-39. Recommendations on the development of computer science curriculum.
5 (a) The council on elementary and secondary education ("council") shall develop
6 recommendations on a computer science curriculum to prepare students for successful
7 postsecondary education and careers in computer science, information technology, and related
8 fields. In developing these recommendations, the council shall consider policies and practices that
9 are designed to increase access to high-quality educational experiences that help more students
10 obtain careers in these fields.
11 (b) The council's recommendations shall identify:
12 (1) High school courses in computer science, including computer coding and computer
13 programming, of sufficient rigor that may be used to satisfy admissions requirements at state
14 colleges and universities, including requirements for mathematics and science;
15 (2) Common academic and technical skills needed for students to meet projected labor
16 market demands in computer science, information technology, and related fields in and outside of
17 the state;
18 (3) How middle and high school students, including underrepresented and nontraditional
19 students, can be encouraged to pursue further studies and careers in computer science, information

1 technology, and related fields;
2 (4) Secondary course sequences which prepare students to succeed in postsecondary
3 educational programs in computer science, information technology, and related fields;
4 (5) Gaps in current policy, curricula, programs, and practices at the state, school district,
5 and postsecondary level which inhibit students from pursuing advanced studies and careers in
6 computer science, information technology, and related fields;
7 (6) Appropriate educator qualifications and computer science pedagogy to maintain
8 technologically current instructional knowledge and practices in teacher preparation programs; and
9 (7) Common definitions for terms related to computer science, including terms such as
10 "computer coding" and "computer programming," for consistent use across both the Rhode Island
11 kindergarten through grade twelve (K-12) education system and the state's postsecondary education
12 system.
13 (c) By December 31, 2026, the council shall report its recommendations to the board of
14 education, the governor, and the general assembly.
15 16-22-40. Computer science and technology instruction.
16 (a) By June 30, 2027, the commissioner of elementary and secondary education
17 ("commissioner") shall develop academic standards for a computer science high school curriculum,
18 including standards and benchmarks for computer coding and computer programming, and identify
19 high school-level courses which incorporate those standards and prepare students for postsecondary
20 success in computer science, information technology, and related fields. In developing these
21 standards, the commissioner shall consider and incorporate the recommendations made by the
22 council on elementary and secondary education pursuant to ยง16-22-30, to the fullest extent the
23 commissioner deems practicable.
24 (b) The courses in the computer science curriculum should, to the extent academically
25 feasible, enable a student to utilize computer science courses to meet mathematics, and science
26 admission requirements at the state colleges and universities, including the Community College of
27 Rhode Island, Rhode Island College, and the University of Rhode Island.
28 (c) If a school district does not offer a course identified by the commissioner pursuant to
29 subsections (a) and (b) of this section, that district shall provide students access to the course
30 through a virtual school or education program, an online program, or through other means.
31 (d) If a student is enrolled in an identified course that satisfies a mathematics, or science
32 admissions requirement for a state postsecondary school, including the Community College of
33 Rhode Island, Rhode Island College, and the University of Rhode Island, the school district shall
34 notify the student that they should contact any private in-state or out-of-state public or private
LC000098 - Page 2 of 4

1 postsecondary institution to which that student is applying and inquire whether the course credit
2 satisfies any of the institution's admissions requirements.
3 (e) The commissioner shall annually report to the council on elementary and secondary
4 education, the governor, and the general assembly on:
5 (1) The courses identified by the commissioner that meet the academic standards for
6 computer science;
7 (2) The number of students, by district, including all public schools and charter public
8 schools, who are enrolled in courses identified by the commissioner that meet the academic
9 standards for computer science; and
10 (3) The number of teachers, educators and other individuals who hold a valid educator
11 certificate in computer science or a related field.
12 (f) The council on elementary and secondary education shall consult with the board of
13 education and school districts to develop strategies for recruiting qualified teachers to provide
14 computer science instruction, updating computer science educator certification requirements,
15 providing appropriate professional development to maintain technologically current instructional
16 knowledge and practices in the school districts, and identifying and streamlining traditional and
17 alternative pathways toward computer science educator certification.
18 SECTION 2. This act shall take effect upon passage.
