JANUARY SESSION, A.D. 2025
____________
A N A C T
Introduced By: Representatives DeSimone, Fellela, McNamara, Biah, Slater, Kazarian,
Hull, and O'Brien
Date Introduced: February 26, 2025
Referred To: House Corporations
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Legislative findings and purpose.
2 (a) The general assembly finds that:
3 (1) School psychologists are part of a comprehensive program to meet student needs,
4 consistent with 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1400 [the "Individuals with Disabilities Education Act"] and 20
5 U.S.C. Sec. 6301 [the "Every Student Succeeds Act"].
6 (2) School psychologists are an integral part of the school team and support student
7 learning, mental health and behavior to help students achieve academically, socially, behaviorally,
8 and emotionally.
9 (3) The National Association of School Psychologists recommends a maximum ratio of
10 five hundred (500) students per school psychologists in order to provide a comprehensive range of
11 school psychological services.
12 (4) There is a shortage of school psychologists in Rhode Island, with an estimated ratio of
13 763:1. Ratios in the urban districts average 1:1000.
14 (5) A shortage of school psychologists across the State of Rhode Island jeopardizes the
15 state's ability to provide essential services and supports to students, schools, and communities.
16 (6) Data indicate that shortages of school psychologists will persist into the future.
17 (7) There is an insufficient number of credentialed school psychology graduates produced
18 by the state's higher education institutions to fill existing gaps.
19 (8) Initiatives designed to promote and support the education and preparation of school
1 psychologists can help mitigate the problem of a shortage.
2 (9) Research and best practice show that after three (3) years of employment within a
3 school, school psychologists become imbedded in their community, resulting in lower turnover
4 within the profession.
5 (b) The purpose of this legislation is:
6 (1) To address the shortage of school psychologists in the State of Rhode Island.
7 (2) To address the shortage of school psychologists in the higher education pipeline.
8 (3) To create a pipeline for licensure through the department of health that would allow for
9 independent contracting, educational evaluations, consultation, and other services related to the
10 academic learning process.
11 (4) To improve the academic, behavioral, and social–emotional well-being of children and
12 youth by increasing access to high quality school-employed mental and behavioral health
13 professionals.
14 (5) To improve the academic, behavioral, and social-emotional well-being of children and
15 youth by increasing community access to high quality mental and behavioral health professionals
16 who specialize in school psychology, and psychoeducational evaluations.
17 (6) To ensure the state fulfills its obligations to state and federal laws that address students
18 with disabilities, school safety, school climate and social and emotional learning.

A N A C T
RELATING TO BUSINESSES AND PROFESSIONS -- PSYCHOLOGISTS
Introduced By: Representatives DeSimone, Fellela, McNamara, Biah, Slater, Kazarian,
Hull, and O'Brien
Date Introduced: February 26, 2025
Referred To: House Corporations
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Legislative findings and purpose.
2 (a) The general assembly finds that:
3 (1) School psychologists are part of a comprehensive program to meet student needs,
4 consistent with 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1400 [the "Individuals with Disabilities Education Act"] and 20
5 U.S.C. Sec. 6301 [the "Every Student Succeeds Act"].
6 (2) School psychologists are an integral part of the school team and support student
7 learning, mental health and behavior to help students achieve academically, socially, behaviorally,
8 and emotionally.
9 (3) The National Association of School Psychologists recommends a maximum ratio of
10 five hundred (500) students per school psychologists in order to provide a comprehensive range of
11 school psychological services.
12 (4) There is a shortage of school psychologists in Rhode Island, with an estimated ratio of
13 763:1. Ratios in the urban districts average 1:1000.
14 (5) A shortage of school psychologists across the State of Rhode Island jeopardizes the
15 state's ability to provide essential services and supports to students, schools, and communities.
16 (6) Data indicate that shortages of school psychologists will persist into the future.
17 (7) There is an insufficient number of credentialed school psychology graduates produced
18 by the state's higher education institutions to fill existing gaps.
19 (8) Initiatives designed to promote and support the education and preparation of school

1 psychologists can help mitigate the problem of a shortage.
2 (9) Research and best practice show that after three (3) years of employment within a
3 school, school psychologists become imbedded in their community, resulting in lower turnover
4 within the profession.
5 (b) The purpose of this legislation is:
6 (1) To address the shortage of school psychologists in the State of Rhode Island.
7 (2) To address the shortage of school psychologists in the higher education pipeline.
8 (3) To create a pipeline for licensure through the department of health that would allow for
9 independent contracting, educational evaluations, consultation, and other services related to the
10 academic learning process.
11 (4) To improve the academic, behavioral, and social–emotional well-being of children and
12 youth by increasing access to high quality school-employed mental and behavioral health
13 professionals.
14 (5) To improve the academic, behavioral, and social-emotional well-being of children and
15 youth by increasing community access to high quality mental and behavioral health professionals
16 who specialize in school psychology, and psychoeducational evaluations.
17 (6) To ensure the state fulfills its obligations to state and federal laws that address students
18 with disabilities, school safety, school climate and social and emotional learning.
19 SECTION 2. Sections 5-44-1, 5-44-12, 5-44-13 and 5-44-15 of the General Laws in
