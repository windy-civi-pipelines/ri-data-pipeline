WASTE DIVERSION
Introduced By: Senators Valverde, Kallman, Vargas, Euer, McKenney, Gu, DiMario,
Sosnowski, and Lauria
Date Introduced: January 31, 2025
Referred To: Senate Finance
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Legislative Findings.
2 The general assembly finds and declares that:
3 (1) Approximately one third of the material disposed of at the RI resource recovery central
4 landfill is compostable;
5 (2) The central landfill is estimated to be full by 2043;
6 (3) Rhode Island has one of the lowest municipal landfill tipping fees in New England;
7 (4) The general public is increasingly interested in diverting their food scraps;
8 (5) Compost added to soil increases soil organic matter, in turn improving soil’s ability to
9 sequester carbon, and reduces the need for synthetic nitrogen fertilizer, which can lead to reduced
10 emissions associated with the production and use of nitrogen fertilizer;
11 (6) Healthy agricultural soils sequester carbon and play a vital role in protecting our
12 waterways and the climate, and ensuring crop yields and farm profitability;
13 (7) Composting reduces greenhouse gas emissions, builds healthy soils, manages water
14 runoff and quality, and builds local economies;
15 (8) Enforcing a “Polluter Pays” principle via a surcharge on materials disposed is an
16 effective way to encourage waste diversion and raise funds to support development and expansion
17 of waste diversion programs and infrastructure;
18 (9) Several other states have instituted disposal surcharges to fund waste diversion and
1 litter abatement, including New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, North Carolina,
2 Ohio and Wisconsin; of these, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, and Wisconsin also fund other
3 environmental programs from disposal surcharges;
4 (10) Whole or pulverized shell has high value as a raw material and does not degrade, and
5 therefore, should not be disposed of in a landfill, but recycled or recovered from trash and reused;
6 (11) Reducing wasted food and increasing composting is in line with the goals of Rhode
7 Island’s 2021 Act on Climate.
8 SECTION 2. Title 42 of the General Laws entitled "STATE AFFAIRS AND
9 GOVERNMENT" is hereby amended by adding thereto the following chapter:
10 CHAPTER 6.3
11 COMPOSTING AND ORGANIC WASTE DIVERSION
12 42-6.3-1. Short title.

18 (b) Establishing the competitive composting and waste diversion grant fund ("CG fund")
19 as a special, nonlapsing fund; requiring interest earnings of the competitive composting and waste
20 diversion grant fund to be credited to the competitive composting and waste diversion grant fund.
21 (c) Establishing the municipal waste diversion grant fund ("MG fund") as a special,
22 nonlapsing fund, requiring interest earnings of the municipal waste diversion grant fund to be
23 credited to the municipal waste diversion grant fund.
24 (d) Establishing a solid waste disposal surcharge pursuant to the provisions of § 42-6-3-4,
25 to be collected and transferred, on a quarterly basis, to the office of the general treasurer, by Rhode
26 Island resource recovery corporation established pursuant to § 23-19-6, or other refuse disposal

IN GENERAL ASSEMBLY
JANUARY SESSION, A.D. 2025
____________
A N A C T
RELATING TO STATE AFFAIRS AND GOVERNMENT -- COMPOSTING AND ORGANIC
WASTE DIVERSION
Introduced By: Senators Valverde, Kallman, Vargas, Euer, McKenney, Gu, DiMario,
Sosnowski, and Lauria
Date Introduced: January 31, 2025
Referred To: Senate Finance
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Legislative Findings.
2 The general assembly finds and declares that:
3 (1) Approximately one third of the material disposed of at the RI resource recovery central
4 landfill is compostable;
5 (2) The central landfill is estimated to be full by 2043;
6 (3) Rhode Island has one of the lowest municipal landfill tipping fees in New England;
7 (4) The general public is increasingly interested in diverting their food scraps;
8 (5) Compost added to soil increases soil organic matter, in turn improving soil’s ability to
9 sequester carbon, and reduces the need for synthetic nitrogen fertilizer, which can lead to reduced
10 emissions associated with the production and use of nitrogen fertilizer;
11 (6) Healthy agricultural soils sequester carbon and play a vital role in protecting our
12 waterways and the climate, and ensuring crop yields and farm profitability;
13 (7) Composting reduces greenhouse gas emissions, builds healthy soils, manages water
14 runoff and quality, and builds local economies;
15 (8) Enforcing a “Polluter Pays” principle via a surcharge on materials disposed is an
16 effective way to encourage waste diversion and raise funds to support development and expansion
17 of waste diversion programs and infrastructure;
18 (9) Several other states have instituted disposal surcharges to fund waste diversion and

1 litter abatement, including New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, North Carolina,
2 Ohio and Wisconsin; of these, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, and Wisconsin also fund other
3 environmental programs from disposal surcharges;
4 (10) Whole or pulverized shell has high value as a raw material and does not degrade, and
5 therefore, should not be disposed of in a landfill, but recycled or recovered from trash and reused;
6 (11) Reducing wasted food and increasing composting is in line with the goals of Rhode
7 Island’s 2021 Act on Climate.
8 SECTION 2. Title 42 of the General Laws entitled "STATE AFFAIRS AND
9 GOVERNMENT" is hereby amended by adding thereto the following chapter:
10 CHAPTER 6.3
11 COMPOSTING AND ORGANIC WASTE DIVERSION
12 42-6.3-1. Short title.
13 This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Composting and Organic Waste
14 Diversion."
15 42-6.3-2. Purpose.
16 (a) Establishing the compost fund as a special, nonlapsing fund; requiring interest earnings
