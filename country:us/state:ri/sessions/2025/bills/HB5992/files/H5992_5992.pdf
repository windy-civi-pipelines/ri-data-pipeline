29 (18) from onset of pregnancy shall be eligible for cash assistance only if the family resides in the
30 home of an adult parent, legal guardian, or other adult relative. The assistance shall be provided to
31 the adult parent, legal guardian, or other adult relative on behalf of the individual and child unless
32 otherwise authorized by the department.

LC002071 - Page 8 of 12

1 department determines that the physical or emotional health or safety of the minor parent, or his or
2 her child, or the pregnant minor, would be jeopardized if he or she was required to live in the same
3 residence as his or her parent, legal guardian, or other adult relative (refusal of a parent, legal
4 guardian, or other adult relative to allow the minor parent or his or her child, or a pregnant minor,
5 to live in his or her home shall constitute a presumption that the health or safety would be so
6 jeopardized); or the minor parent or pregnant minor has lived apart from his or her own parent or
7 legal guardian for a period of at least one year before either the birth of any child to a minor parent
8 or the onset of the pregnant minor’s pregnancy; or there is good cause, under departmental

10 arrangement to the extent available.
11 (3) For purposes of this section, “supervised supportive-living arrangement” means an
12 arrangement that requires minor parents to enroll and make satisfactory progress in a program

21 that the family member has at the time the assignment is executed or may have while receiving
22 assistance under this chapter;
23 (2) Consent to and cooperate with the state in establishing the paternity and in establishing
24 and/or enforcing child support and medical support orders for all children in the family or assistance
25 unit in accordance with title 15 of the general laws, as amended, unless the parent or caretaker
26 relative is found to have good cause for refusing to comply with the requirements of this subsection.
27 (3) Absent good cause, as defined by the department of human services through the
28 rulemaking process, for refusing to comply with the requirements of subsections (l)(1) and (l)(2),
29 cash assistance to the family shall be reduced by twenty-five percent (25%) until the adult member
30 of the family who has refused to comply with the requirements of this subsection consents to and
31 cooperates with the state in accordance with the requirements of this subsection.
32 (4) As a condition of eligibility for cash and medical assistance under this chapter, each

10 the terms and conditions of the work requirements of § 40-5.2-12. An adult caretaker relative shall
11 be eligible for assistance as a member of the assistance unit so long as he or she meets all the
12 eligibility requirements of this chapter.
13 (c) The monthly amount of cash assistance shall be equal to the payment standard for the
14 family minus the countable income of the family in that month. The department is authorized to
15 reduce the amount of assistance in the month of application to reflect the number of the days
16 between the first day of the month and the effective date of the application.

33 receiving cash assistance pursuant to this chapter, the first fifty dollars ($50.00) one hundred dollars
