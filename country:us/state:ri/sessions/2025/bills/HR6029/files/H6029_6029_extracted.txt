Date Introduced: March 06, 2025
Referred To: House read and passed
1 WHEREAS, It is with deep sadness that this House of Representatives has learned of the
2 passing of Jeanette Restivo of North Providence. She was the beloved wife of the late Edmund
3 Restivo; and
4 WHEREAS, Jeanette Restivo, fondly known to family and friends as Jean, was born in
5 1937, a daughter of the late Cosmo and Felicia Lamantia, themselves Italian emigrates who came
6 to the United States from Italy in the 1920s; and
7 WHEREAS, In 1955, Jean met Edmund Restivo who quickly, after a short courtship,
8 became the love of her life. They wed and together raised six wonderful children who were
9 brought up surrounded by the deep love and nurturing provided by their immediate and extended
10 family; and
11 WHEREAS, Jean Restivo spent much of her life immersed in the vibrant Italian-
12 American communities of North Providence, and Providence, where she and her husband raised
13 their children. Thanks to Jean's outgoing magnetic personality and warmth and generosity of
14 spirit, her home became a beacon for her many friends and good neighbors. Jean always dazzled
15 people with her cooking skills, but for her, food was much more than tasty nourishment. Her food
16 was also good for the soul as it served as an effective way to bring people together for good
17 conversation or for comfort in times of hardship; and
18 WHEREAS, As word spread about Jean's incredible cooking skills, it became inevitable
19 that a cookbook, or rather five cookbooks, would get published. The first cookbook was titled
20 Cucina di Nonna, “My Grandmother’s Kitchen”, a cookbook filled with recipes Jeanette inherited
1 from her mother, children, friends and those she created on her own. In between discussing her
2 recipes in the book, Jean tells wonderfully illuminating stories about the many fond memories she
3 had about her family life; and
4 WHEREAS, Jeanette Restivo leaves behind five children, sons Edmund A. Restivo, Jr.,
5 and his wife Susan, Thomas M. Restivo, and his wife, Claire, and daughters, Teresa P. Eagan, and
6 her husband, Thomas, Jean F. Monti and her husband, Steven, and Susan M. Craven and her
7 husband, our colleague, the Honorable Robert E. Craven, Sr., Jean also leaves behind her sisters,
8 Mary Piccirillo and Doreen Pelagio, thirteen grandchildren, Alaina, Michael, Christopher, Jon,
9 Nicholas, Daniel, Amanda, Alexander, Matthew, Laura, Robert, David, and Joseph, and
10 seventeen great-grandchildren. Jeanette Restivo was predeceased by her brother, John Lamantia,
11 and her son, John M. Restivo; now, therefore be it
12 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
13 expresses its deepest condolences to the Restivo Family on the passing of Jeanette Restivo; and
14 RESOLVED, The Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to transmit
15 duly certified copies of this resolution to Edmund A. Restivo, Jr., Thomas M. Restivo, Teresa P.
16 Eagan, Jean F. Monti, and Susan M. Craven.
