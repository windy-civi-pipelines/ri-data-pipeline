17 (c) A landlord terminating a tenancy with a thirty (30) day notice without cause as
18 authorized by § 34-18-37, shall not reset the rent for the next tenancy in an amount greater than

5 (2) The landlord is providing reduced rent to the tenant as part of a federal, state or local
6 program or subsidy; or
7 (3) The landlord is granted an exemption by the secretary of housing. A landlord may be

17 (f)(1) A landlord that increases rent in violation of this section or a landlord which

25 are reckless or callous indifference to the requirements of this section, the court may award punitive
26 damage.
27 (g) A tenant is entitled to recovery under this section if the tenant commences an action
28 asserting the claim within one year after the tenant knew or should have known the landlord
29 terminated the tenancy in violation of this section.
30 (h) This section does not create a right to increase rent that does not otherwise exist.
31 (i) This section does not require a landlord to compromise, justify or reduce a rent increase
32 that the landlord otherwise is entitled to impose.
33 (j) The secretary of housing shall enforce the provisions of this section.
