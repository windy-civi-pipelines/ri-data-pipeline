3 provided at two (2) levels with the distinction being operations generating less than fifty thousand
4 dollars ($50,000) in average sales would be limited to an exemption on motor vehicles up to five
5 thousand dollars ($5,000) in value. Exempt would be machinery and equipment to include, but not

10 buildings at a rate that reflects the actual cost incurred by the municipality in providing services to
11 these buildings. Finally, this act would provide that forest product operations are permitted uses
12 within all zoning districts of a municipality except where prohibited for public health or safety
