10 codes as defined in this section, and providers with the following professional credentials:
11 physicians, certified nurse practitioners, and physician assistants; except that a specialty medical
12 provider including, but not limited to, an obstetrics/gynecology or behavioral health provider, may
13 be considered a primary care provider if they meet any criteria set forth, or are otherwise designated
14 as such, pursuant to guidance or regulations issued by the executive office of health and human
15 services pursuant to § 42-7.2-11.
16 (3) “Primary care services” means services described by the primary care billing and

11 (b) Achieving parity with Medicare rates for primary care services. The executive office of
12 health and human services shall pursue a Medicaid state plan amendment, waiver submission, or
13 any other necessary change in regulation or guidance, and shall allocate sufficient state general
14 revenue, to increase Medicaid payment rates for primary care services furnished by primary care
15 providers to equal no less than one hundred percent (100%) of Medicare rates. This increase shall

17 (c) Implementation. In implementing this section, the executive office of health and human

20 pursue any necessary amendment to, or any execution of, contracts with Medicaid managed care
21 organizations to promptly effectuate this provision. With respect to primary care services furnished
22 by primary care providers participating in the Medicaid accountable entity program, the executive
23 office of health and human services shall make any such payment adjustments as may be necessary
24 to ensure such entities receive an equivalent benefit, taking into account the financial methodology
25 of such program. With respect to primary care services furnished by primary care providers at
26 community health centers, the executive office of health and human services shall adjust the
27 alternative payment methodology under which community health centers are reimbursed as may
28 be necessary to ensure such centers receive an equivalent increase in reimbursement.
29 (d) Sunset. Unless extended by the general assembly, the provisions of this section shall
30 sunset and expire on June 30, 2027.
