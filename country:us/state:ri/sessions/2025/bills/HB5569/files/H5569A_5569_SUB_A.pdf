6 (a) The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public welfare by creating a
7 comprehensive legal framework within which pet insurance may be sold in this state.
8 (b) The requirements of this chapter shall apply to pet insurance policies that are issued to
9 any resident of this state and are sold, solicited, negotiated, or offered in this state, and policies or
10 certificates that are delivered or issued for delivery in this state.
11 (c) All other applicable provisions of this state’s insurance laws shall continue to apply to
12 pet insurance except that the specific provisions of this chapter shall supersede any general
13 provisions of law that would otherwise be applicable to pet insurance.
14 27-83-2. Definitions.
15 (a) If a pet insurer uses any of the terms in this chapter in a policy of pet insurance, the pet
16 insurer shall use the definition of each of those terms as set forth herein and include the definition
17 of the term(s) in the policy. The pet insurer shall also make the definition available through a clear
18 and conspicuous link on the main page of the pet insurer or pet insurer’s program administrator’s
19 website.

1 (b) Nothing in this chapter shall in any way prohibit or limit the types of exclusions pet
2 insurers may use in their policies or require pet insurers to have any of the limitations or exclusions
3 defined below.
4 (c) For purposes of this chapter:
5 (1) “Chronic condition” means a condition that can be treated or managed, but not cured.
6 (2) “Congenital anomaly or disorder” means a condition that is present from birth, whether
7 inherited or caused by the environment, which may cause or contribute to illness or disease.
8 (3) “Hereditary disorder” means an abnormality that is genetically transmitted from parent
9 to offspring and may cause illness or disease.
10 (4) “Orthopedic” refers to conditions affecting the bones, skeletal muscle, cartilage,
11 tendons, ligaments, and joints. It includes, but is not limited to, elbow dysplasia, hip dysplasia,
12 intervertebral disc degeneration, patellar luxation, and ruptured cranial cruciate ligaments. It does
13 not include cancers or metabolic, hemopoietic, or autoimmune diseases.
14 (5) “Pet insurance” means a property insurance policy that provides coverage for accidents
15 and illnesses of pets.
16 (6) “Preexisting condition” means any condition for which any of the following are true
17 prior to the effective date of a pet insurance policy or during any waiting period:
18 (i) A veterinarian provided medical advice;
19 (ii) The pet received previous treatment; or
20 (iii) Based on information from verifiable sources, the pet had signs or symptoms directly
21 related to the condition for which a claim is being made.
22 (iv) A condition for which coverage is afforded on a policy cannot be considered a
23 preexisting condition on any renewal of the policy.
24 (7) “Renewal” means to issue and deliver at the end of an insurance policy period a policy
25 which supersedes a policy previously issued and delivered by the same pet insurer or affiliated pet
26 insurer and which provides types and limits of coverage substantially similar to those contained in
27 the policy being superseded.
28 (8) “Veterinarian” means an individual who holds a valid license to practice veterinary

5 (i) Pays or indemnifies another as to loss from certain contingencies called "risks,"
6 including through reinsurance;
7 (ii) Pays or grants a specified amount or determinable benefit to another in connection with
8 ascertainable risk contingencies; or
9 (iii) Acts as a surety, it is transacting in the business of insurance and is subject to the
10 insurance code, as defined in § 27-54.1-1. This definition is not intended to classify a contract
11 directly between a service provider and a pet owner that only involves the two (2) parties as being
12 “the business of insurance,” unless other indications of insurance also exist.
