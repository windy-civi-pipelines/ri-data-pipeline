1 used in this chapter shall have the same meaning as defined in § 17-25-3.
2 (b) Any person, business entity or political action committee making independent
3 expenditures, electioneering communications, or covered transfers shall report all such campaign

13 report after each time the person, business entity or political action committee makes or contracts
14 to make independent expenditures, electioneering communications, or covered transfers
15 aggregating an additional one thousand dollars ($1,000) with respect to the same election as that to
16 which the initial report relates.

2 If the electronic campaign finance reporting system is not technologically capable of providing
3 such information to the public, the board shall create an interim procedure for the public to obtain
4 the information reported under this subsection.
5 (g) The report shall also include a statement identifying the candidate or referendum that
6 the independent expenditure or electioneering communication is intended to promote the success
7 or defeat, and affirm under penalty of false statement that the expenditure is not coordinated with
8 the campaign in question, and provide any information that the board of elections requires to

13 section.
14 (b) Self-dealing by any controlling person of contributions or donations received by a
15 committee is prohibited. For the purposes of this section, the use of a contribution or donation shall
16 be presumed to be self-dealing if the contribution or donation is used to make a significant
17 disbursement to a controlling person.

25 relied upon appropriate data as to fair market value prior to approving the disbursement;
26 (4) The agent documented the basis for the approval determination concurrently with
27 making that determination; and
28 (5) At the time the significant disbursement was made, the aggregate total of itemized
29 contributions to the committee during the election cycle exceeded the aggregate total of
30 disbursements to controlling persons by the committee during the election cycle.
31 (d) In addition to the presumption in subsection (b) of this section, the use of contributions
32 or donations for the following purposes to benefit a controlling person shall be considered self-
33 dealing and is specifically prohibited.
34 (1) Any residential or household items, supplies, or expenditures, including mortgage, rent,
LC002726 - Page 17 of 19

1 or utility payments for any part of any personal residence;
2 (2) Mortgage, rent, or utility payments for any part of any nonresidential property that is
3 owned by a controlling person and used for campaign purposes, to the extent the payments exceed

5 (3) Funeral, cremation, or burial expenses, including any expenses related to deaths within
6 a controlling person's family;
7 (4) Clothing, other than items of de minimis value that are used in the campaign;
8 (5) Tuition payments;
9 (6) Dues, fees, or gratuities at a country club, health club, recreational facility or other
10 nonpolitical organization, unless they are part of a specific fundraising event that takes place on the
11 organization's premises;
12 (7) Admission to a sporting event, concert, theater, or other form of entertainment unless
13 part of a specific campaign or officeholder activity; and
14 (8) Payment of any fines, fees, or penalties assessed pursuant to this chapter.
15 (e) For purposes of this section:
16 (1) "Agent" means any person with actual authority, whether express or implied, to engage
17 in activities on behalf of another person.
18 (2) "Committee" means an authorized campaign committee of a candidate or officeholder,
19 a political action committee, or a political party committee.
20 (3) "Controlling person" means any person who has authority or ability to direct or control
21 the committee's disbursements, any family member or business partner of such person, and any
22 business entity or other entity owned or controlled, in whole or in part, by such person, family
23 member, or business partner.
24 (4) "Significant disbursement" means a disbursement that exceeds one thousand dollars
25 ($1,000) or, when aggregated with all other disbursements by the committee to the recipient within
26 the calendar year, exceeds five thousand dollars ($5,000).

28 of campaign funds under § 17-25-7.2.
