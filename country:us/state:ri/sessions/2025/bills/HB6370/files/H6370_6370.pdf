4 (a) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, an insured under any insurance policy as set
5 out in the general laws or otherwise may bring an action against the insurer issuing the policy when
6 it is alleged the insurer wrongfully and in bad faith refused to pay or settle a claim made pursuant
7 to the provisions of the policy, or otherwise wrongfully and in bad faith refused to timely perform
8 its obligations under the contract of insurance. In any action brought pursuant to this section, an
9 insured may also make claim for compensatory damages, punitive damages, and reasonable
10 attorney fees. In all cases in which there has been no trial in the superior court on or before May
11 20, 1981, the question of whether or not an insurer has acted in bad faith in refusing to settle a claim
12 shall be a question to be determined by the trier of fact.
13 (b) The provisions of this section shall apply to all actions against insurers which have been
14 commenced and are pending in any state or federal court on May 20, 1981.
15 (c) A cause of action under this section is independent of a breach of contract claim, and
16 an insured is not required to establish a breach of contract before seeking recovery under this
17 section.

25 102 insured and of all others in the property, the actual cash value of
26 103 each item thereof and the amount of loss thereto, all encum-
27 104 brances thereon, all other contracts of insurance, whether valid

3 113 ery destroyed or damaged. The insured, as often as may be
4 114 reasonably required, shall exhibit to any person designated by
5 115 this company all that remains of any property herein described,

7 117 this company, and subscribe the same; and, as often as may be
8 118 reasonably required, shall produce for examination all books of
9 119 account, bills, invoices, and other vouchers, or certified copies

11 place as
12 121 may be designated by this company or its representative, and
13 122 shall permit extracts and copies thereof to be made.
14 123 Appraisal. In case the insured and this company shall
15 124 fail to agree as to the actual cash value or
16 125 the amount of loss, then, on the written demand of either, each
17 126 shall select a competent and disinterested appraiser and notify
18 127 the other of the appraiser selected within twenty (20) days of
19 128 that demand. The appraisers shall first select a competent and
20 129 disinterested umpire; and failing for fifteen (15) days to agree
21 130 upon the umpire, then, on request of the insured or this com-
22 131 pany, the umpire shall be selected by a judge of a court of
23 132 record in the state in which the property covered is located. The
24 133 appraisers shall then appraise the loss, stating separately actual
25 134 cash value and loss to each item; and, failing to agree, shall
26 135 submit their differences, only, to the umpire. An award in writ-
27 136 ing, so itemized, of any two (2) when filed with this company

32 140 the parties equally.

34 124 party may submit a written demand for appraisal. A denial of coverage does
LC002941 - Page 7 of 16

1 125 not relieve this company of its obligation to resolve disputes regarding the amount of loss
2 126 through appraisal.
3 127 Once appraisal is demanded, each party shall select an appraiser who is competent,
4 128 disinterested, and knowledgeable of the regulations promulgated under
5 129 § 27-9.1-8, or its successors, concerning the calculation of actual cash value, replacement
6 130 cost value, and consequential damage. Each party must notify the other of its selected
7 131 appraiser within twenty (20) days of the demand.
8 132 The appraisers shall have fifteen (15) days from their appointment to agree on a competent
9 133 and disinterested appraisal umpire; and failing, for any reason, for fifteen (15) days to
10 134 select an umpire, upon request of either the insured or this company, the umpire shall be
11 135 selected by a judge of a court of record in the state where the property covered is located.
12 136 The appraisers shall then appraise the loss, separately stating the actual cash value,
13 137 replacement cost value, and cause of the loss. If they fail to agree, only their differences
14 138 shall be submitted to the umpire. Actual cash value and replacement cost value shall be
15 139 determined in accordance with the regulations promulgated under
16 140 § 27-9.1-8, or its successors. The award shall include interest calculated from the date of
17 141 loss. A written award, so itemized, signed by any two (2) members of the appraisal panel,
18 142 filed with this company, shall determine the actual cash value and replacement cost value
19 143 of the loss. If this policy covers the appraised loss on a replacement cost basis, the
20 144 replacement cost value stated in the award shall be the amount due to the insured. This
21 145 company shall issue payment of the appraisal award within thirty (30) days of receiving
22 146 the award, unless the policy does not provide coverage for the cause of loss determined
23 147 by the award.
24 148 If this company disputes the validity of the appraisal award, it must, at the time of filing its
25 149 initial court action contesting the award or its initial defense against nonpayment of the
26 150 award, deposit the total amount of loss listed in the award into the court registry pending
27 151 resolution of the dispute.
28 152 Each appraiser shall be paid by the party selecting them, and the costs of the appraisal and
29 153 umpire shall be shared equally by the parties.
30 141154 Company's It shall be optional with this company to
31 142155 options. take all, or any part, of the property at the
32 143156 agreed or appraised value, and also to re-
33 144157 pair, rebuild, or replace the property destroyed or damaged with

4 149162 pany of any property.

6 151164 payable may be liable shall be payable sixty (60) thirty (30)

9 154167 made either by agreement between the insured and this com-
10 155168 pany expressed in writing or by the filing with this company
11 156169 of an award as herein provided.
12 157170 Suit. No suit or action on this policy for the recov-
13 158171 ery of any claim shall be sustainable in any
14 159172 court of law or equity unless all the requirements of this policy
15 160173 shall have been complied with, and unless commenced within
16 161174 twenty-four (24) months next after inception of the loss.
17 162175 Subrogation. This company may require from the insured
18 163176 an assignment of all rights of recovery.
