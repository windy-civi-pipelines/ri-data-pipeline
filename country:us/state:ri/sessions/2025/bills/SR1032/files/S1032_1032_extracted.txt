BE "COMPOSTING AWARENESS WEEK IN THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND"
Introduced By: Senators Valverde, Kallman, Lauria, Mack, Raptakis, Gu, Sosnowski,
DiPalma, Murray, and Rogers
Date Introduced: May 07, 2025
Referred To: Recommended for Immediate Consideration
1 WHEREAS, Compost, a mixture made of organic materials such as yard trimmings,
2 vegetable and fruit peels and scraps, other food scraps, flowers, eggshells, paper products,
3 nutshells, saw dust, wood chips, biosolids, manure, hay shavings, and leaves, is rich in moisture
4 and nutrients, and added to the soil in gardens and farms to help plants and crops grow; and
5 WHEREAS, Compost retains and transfers moisture through the soil to the plant, which
6 minimizes the need for irrigation, reduces water usage by up to 30 percent, conserves water
7 during droughts, and prevents flooding by retaining water that would otherwise enter drains and
8 sewers; and
9 WHEREAS, Compost is rich in nutrients and organisms beneficial for plant health and
10 growth, such as worms, centipedes, spiders, beetles, and fungal mycelium, which minimizes the
11 need for chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and reduces soil and water pollution; and
12 WHEREAS, Composting reduces waste by reusing and recycling organic materials,
13 which make up approximately 30 percent of all materials sent to landfills, and can help
14 communities that implement composting programs to efficiently divert waste from landfills and
15 become more sustainable; and
16 WHEREAS, The beneficial organisms and microbes in compost sequester and retain
17 carbon in the soil, and prevent carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases, which
18 would otherwise be produced in large amounts by decomposing waste in landfills, from being
19 released into the atmosphere; and
1 WHEREAS, Using compost in certain public works projects, such as the construction and
2 improvement of parks, trails, highways, and green spaces, can lead to large-scale reductions in
3 pollution, help prevent climate change, and lead to the creation of green jobs; and
4 WHEREAS, The threat of and importance of action against climate change was
5 recognized by the state through the 2021 Act on Climate, which recognizes that Rhode Island is
6 especially vulnerable to climate change caused by greenhouse gases; and
7 WHEREAS, The need to divert food waste and other organic materials to better and
8 higher uses has been recognized by the state through legislation including R.I. Gen. Law ยง 23-
9 18.9-17 that aims to help increase composting rates by requiring large food generators producing
10 more than 104 tons of food waste per year to recycle food waste through various methods,
11 including composting; now, therefore be it
12 RESOLVED, That this Senate of the State of Rhode Island hereby proclaims the week of
13 May 5th through May 12th of each year to be "Composting Awareness Week in the State of
14 Rhode Island"; and be it further
15 RESOLVED, That this Senate hereby recognizes the importance of composting in
16 nourishing essential plants and crops, mitigating the effects of climate change, conserving water,
17 preventing flooding, recycling waste, preventing pollution, and creating green jobs, and further
18 encourage composting by businesses and individuals; and be it further
19 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
20 transmit a duly certified copy of this resolution to Daniel McKee, Governor of the State of Rhode
21 Island.
