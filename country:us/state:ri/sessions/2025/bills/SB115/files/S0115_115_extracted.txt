IN GENERAL ASSEMBLY
JANUARY SESSION, A.D. 2025

Introduced By: Senators Lauria, Euer, Valverde, Murray, Felag, Pearson, Urso, and
Ujifusa
Date Introduced: January 31, 2025
Referred To: Senate Health & Human Services
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Findings of fact
2 The Rhode Island general assembly recognizes that glucagon auto-injectors are life-saving
3 medications, that must be administered quickly to be effective. Such administration is often done
4 by persons who are not health care professionals, and is done in an emergency situation.
5 Accordingly, it is in the best interests of the people of the state to promote the widespread
6 availability of glucagon, that does not require reconstitution. Hypoglycemia, or low blood glucose,
7 is a barrier to diabetes control, leads to worse clinical outcomes, stress, increased cost of care and
8 polypharmacy. For unconscious patients, and those unable to ingest oral glucose, glucagon in the
9 ambulatory setting is indicated, but often underutilized, due to excessive cost.
10 SECTION 2. Chapter 27-18 of the General Laws entitled "Accident and Sickness Insurance
11 Policies" is hereby amended by adding thereto the following section:
12 27-18-95. Glucagon hypoglycemia medications..
13 Every individual or group health insurance contract, plan, or policy that provides
14 prescription coverage and that is delivered, issued for delivery, prescribed, or renewed in this state
15 on or after January 1, 2026, shall provide coverage for at least one type of glucagon auto-injector,
16 nasal spray or formulation not requiring reconstitution. There shall be no copayment required and
17 no deductible shall need to be met, to obtain two (2) glucagon auto-injectors, nasal spray or non-
18 reconstituted formulation covered by the contract, plan, or policy, every twelve (12) month plan
19 year. A deductible may be applied to health plans that are paired with federally qualified health
1 savings account pursuant to 26 U.S.C § 223. Nothing in this section would prohibit a health plan
2 from implementing this benefit prior to January 1. 2026.
3 SECTION 3. Chapter 27-19 of the General Laws entitled "Nonprofit Hospital Service
4 Corporations" is hereby amended by adding thereto the following section:
5 27-19-87. Glucagon hypoglycemia medications..
6 Every individual or group health insurance contract, plan, or policy that provides
7 prescription coverage and that is delivered, issued for delivery, prescribed, or renewed in this state
8 on or after January 1, 2026, shall provide coverage for at least one type of glucagon auto-injector,
9 nasal spray or formulation not requiring reconstitution. There shall be no copayment required and
10 no deductible shall need to be met, to obtain two (2) glucagon auto-injectors, nasal spray or non-
11 reconstituted formulation covered by the contract, plan, or policy, every twelve (12) month plan
12 year. A deductible may be applied to health plans that are paired with federally qualified health
13 savings account pursuant to 26 U.S.C § 223. Nothing in this section would prohibit a health plan
14 from implementing this benefit prior to January 1. 2026.
15 SECTION 4. Chapter 27-20 of the General Laws entitled "Nonprofit Medical Service
16 Corporations" is hereby amended by adding thereto the following section:
17 27-20-83. Glucagon hypoglycemia medications..
18 Every individual or group health insurance contract, plan, or policy that provides
19 prescription coverage and that is delivered, issued for delivery, prescribed, or renewed in this state
20 on or after January 1, 2026, shall provide coverage for at least one type of glucagon auto-injector,
21 nasal spray or formulation not requiring reconstitution. There shall be no copayment required and
22 no deductible shall need to be met, to obtain two (2) glucagon auto-injectors, nasal spray or non-
23 reconstituted formulation covered by the contract, plan, or policy, every twelve (12) month plan
24 year. A deductible may be applied to health plans that are paired with federally qualified health
25 savings account pursuant to 26 U.S.C § 223. Nothing in this section would prohibit a health plan
26 from implementing this benefit prior to January 1. 2026.
27 SECTION 5. Chapter 27-41 of the General Laws entitled "Health Maintenance
28 Organizations" is hereby amended by adding thereto the following section:
29 27-41-100. Glucagon hypoglycemia medications..
30 Every individual or group health insurance contract, plan, or policy that provides
31 prescription coverage and that is delivered, issued for delivery, prescribed, or renewed in this state
