It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Section 27-18-57 of the General Laws in Chapter 27-18 entitled "Accident
2 and Sickness Insurance Policies" is hereby amended to read as follows:
3 27-18-57. F.D.A. approved prescription contraceptive drugs and devices.
4 (a) Every individual or group health insurance contract, plan, or policy issued pursuant to
5 this title that provides prescription coverage and is delivered, issued for delivery, or renewed,
6 amended or effective in this state on or after January 1, 2026 shall provide coverage for F.D.A.
7 approved contraceptive drugs and devices requiring a prescription all of the following services and
8 contraceptive methods. Provided, that nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to mandate or
9 require coverage for the prescription drug RU 486.
10 (1) All FDA-approved contraceptive drugs, devices, and other products. The following
11 applies to this coverage:
12 (i) If there is a therapeutic equivalent of an FDA-approved contraceptive drug, device, or
13 product, the contract shall include either the original FDA-approved contraceptive drug, device, or
14 product or at least one of its therapeutic equivalents. "Therapeutic equivalent" shall have the same
15 definition as that set forth by the FDA;
16 (ii) If the covered therapeutic equivalent versions of a drug, device, or product are not
17 available, or are not tolerated by the patient, or are deemed medically inadvisable, a group or
18 blanket policy shall provide coverage for an alternate therapeutic equivalent version of the
19 contraceptive drug, device, or product, based on the determination of the health care provider,
1 without cost-sharing; and
2 (iii) A plan shall not require a prescription to trigger coverage of FDA-approved over-the-

6 (2) Voluntary sterilization procedures;
7 (3) Clinical services related to the provision or use of contraception, including

10 (4) Follow-up services related to the drugs, devices, products, and procedures covered
11 under this section, including, but not limited to, management of side effects, counseling for
12 continued adherence, and device insertion and removal.
13 (b) A group or blanket policy subject to this section shall not impose a deductible,
14 coinsurance, copayment or any other cost-sharing requirement on the coverage provided pursuant
15 to this section. For a qualifying high-deductible health plan for a health savings account, the carrier
16 shall establish the plan's cost-sharing for the coverage provided pursuant to this section at the

25 impose any restrictions or delays on the coverage required under this section.

32 apply to contraceptive services or procedures provided for purposes other than contraception, such
33 as decreasing the risk of ovarian cancer or eliminating symptoms of menopause.

13 course of the twelve (12) month period at the discretion of the prescriber.
14 (j) Nothing in this section shall be construed to exclude coverage for contraceptive drugs,
15 devices, or products for reasons other than contraceptive purposes, such as decreasing the risk of
16 ovarian cancer or eliminating symptoms of menopause, or for contraception that is necessary to
17 preserve the life or health of an enrollee. A plan that violates this section is subject to penalties, in
18 accordance with § 27-18-20. The office of the health insurance commissioner ("commissioner")

14 to this section. For a qualifying high-deductible health plan for a health savings account, the carrier
15 shall establish the plan's cost-sharing for the coverage provided pursuant to this section at the
16 minimum level necessary to preserve the enrollee's ability to claim tax-exempt contributions and
17 withdrawals from their health savings account under 26 U.S.C. § 223. A health plan shall not
18 impose utilization control or other forms of medical management limiting the supply of FDA-
19 approved contraception that may be dispensed or furnished by a provider or pharmacist, or at a
20 location licensed or otherwise authorized to dispense drugs or supplies in an amount that is less
21 than a twelve (12) month supply, and shall not require an enrollee to make any formal request for
22 such coverage other than a pharmacy claim.
23 (c) Except as otherwise authorized under this section, a group or blanket policy shall not
24 impose any restrictions or delays on the coverage required under this section.

28 corporation may issue to a religious employer an individual or group health insurance contract,
29 plan, or policy that excludes coverage for prescription contraceptive methods that are contrary to
30 the religious employer's bona fide religious tenets. The exclusion from coverage under this
31 subsection shall not apply to contraceptive services or procedures provided for purposes other than
32 contraception, such as decreasing the risk of ovarian cancer or eliminating symptoms of
33 menopause.
34 (f) As used in this section, "religious employer" means an employer that is a "church or a
LC000242/SUB A - Page 12 of 15
1 qualified church-controlled organization" as defined in 26 U.S.C. § 3121.
2 (g) Every religious employer that invokes the exemption provided under this section shall
3 provide written notice to prospective enrollees prior to enrollment with the plan, listing the
4 contraceptive health care services the employer refuses to cover for religious reasons.
5 (h) Beginning on the first day of each plan year after April 1, 2024, every health insurance
6 issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage that covers prescription contraception
7 shall not restrict reimbursement for dispensing a covered prescription contraceptive up to three
8 hundred sixty-five (365) days at a time that may be furnished or dispensed all at once or over the
9 course of the twelve (12) month period at the discretion of the prescriber.
10 (i) Nothing in this section shall be construed to exclude coverage for contraceptive drugs,
11 devices, or products for reasons other than contraceptive purposes, such as decreasing the risk of
12 ovarian cancer or eliminating symptoms of menopause, or for contraception that is necessary to
13 preserve the life or health of an enrollee. A plan that violates this section is subject to penalties, in
14 accordance with § 40-8-9. The executive office of health and human services may base its
15 determinations on findings from onsite surveys, enrollee or other complaints, financial status, or
16 any other source.
17 (j) The executive office of health and human services shall monitor plan compliance in
18 accordance with this section and shall adopt and regulations rules for the implementation of this
19 section, including the following:
20 (1) In addition to any requirements under state administrative procedures, the executive
21 office of health and human services shall engage in a stakeholder process prior to the adoption of
22 rules and regulations that include health care service plans, pharmacy benefit plans, consumer
23 representatives, including those representing youth, low-income people, and communities of color,
24 and other interested parties. The executive office of health and human services shall hold
25 stakeholder meetings for stakeholders of different types to ensure sufficient opportunity to consider
26 factors and processes relevant to contraceptive coverage. The executive office of health and human
27 services shall provide notice of stakeholder meetings on the executive office of health and human
28 services' website, and stakeholder meetings shall be open to the public.
29 (2) The executive office of health and human services shall conduct random reviews of
30 each plan and its subcontractors to ensure compliance with this section.
31 (3) The executive office of health and human services shall submit an annual report to the
32 general assembly and any other appropriate entity with its findings from the random compliance
33 reviews detailed in this section and any other compliance or implementation efforts. This report
34 shall be made available to the public on the executive office of health and human services' website.

It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Section 27-18-57 of the General Laws in Chapter 27-18 entitled "Accident
2 and Sickness Insurance Policies" is hereby amended to read as follows:
3 27-18-57. F.D.A. approved prescription contraceptive drugs and devices.
4 (a) Every individual or group health insurance contract, plan, or policy issued pursuant to
5 this title that provides prescription coverage and is delivered, issued for delivery, or renewed,
6 amended or effective in this state on or after January 1, 2026 shall provide coverage for F.D.A.

10 (1) All FDA-approved contraceptive drugs, devices, and other products. The following
11 applies to this coverage:
12 (i) If there is a therapeutic equivalent of an FDA-approved contraceptive drug, device, or
13 product, the contract shall include either the original FDA-approved contraceptive drug, device, or
14 product or at least one of its therapeutic equivalents. "Therapeutic equivalent" shall have the same
15 definition as that set forth by the FDA;
16 (ii) If the covered therapeutic equivalent versions of a drug, device, or product are not
17 available, or are not tolerated by the patient, or are deemed medically inadvisable, a group or
18 blanket policy shall provide coverage for an alternate therapeutic equivalent version of the
19 contraceptive drug, device, or product, based on the determination of the health care provider,

1 without cost-sharing; and
2 (iii) A plan shall not require a prescription to trigger coverage of FDA-approved over-the-

13 (b) A group or blanket policy subject to this section shall not impose a deductible,
14 coinsurance, copayment or any other cost-sharing requirement on the coverage provided pursuant
15 to this section. For a qualifying high-deductible health plan for a health savings account, the carrier

18 withdrawals from their health savings account under 26 U.S.C. § 223. A health plan shall not
19 impose utilization control or other forms of medical management limiting the supply of FDA-

13 course of the twelve (12) month period at the discretion of the prescriber.

15 devices, or products for reasons other than contraceptive purposes, such as decreasing the risk of
16 ovarian cancer or eliminating symptoms of menopause, or for contraception that is necessary to
17 preserve the life or health of an enrollee. A plan that violates this section is subject to penalties, in
18 accordance with § 27-18-20. The office of the health insurance commissioner ("commissioner")

24 commissioner shall engage in a stakeholder process prior to the adoption of rules and regulations

28 ensure compliance with this section.
29 (3) The commissioner shall submit an annual report to the general assembly and any other
30 appropriate entity with its findings from the random compliance reviews detailed in this section

33 SECTION 4. Section 27-41-59 of the General Laws in Chapter 27-41 entitled "Health
34 Maintenance Organizations" is hereby amended to read as follows:
LC000242/SUB A - Page 8 of 15

1 27-41-59. FDA approved prescription contraceptive drugs and devices.
2 (a) Every individual or group health insurance contract, plan, or policy issued pursuant to
3 this title that provides prescription coverage and is delivered, issued for delivery, or renewed,
4 amended or effective in this state on or after January 1, 2026 shall provide coverage for FDA
5 approved contraceptive drugs and devices requiring a prescription; provided, all of the following
6 services and contraceptive methods. Provided, that nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to
7 mandate or require coverage for the prescription drug RU 486.
8 (1) All FDA-approved contraceptive drugs, devices, and other products. The following
9 applies to this coverage:
10 (i) If there is a therapeutic equivalent of an FDA-approved contraceptive drug, device, or
11 product, the contract shall include either the original FDA-approved contraceptive drug, device, or
12 product or at least one of its therapeutic equivalents. "Therapeutic equivalent" shall have the same
13 definition as that set forth by the FDA;
14 (ii) If the covered therapeutic equivalent versions of a drug, device, or product are not
15 available, or are not tolerated by the patient, or are deemed medically inadvisable, a group or
16 blanket policy shall provide coverage for an alternate therapeutic equivalent version of the
17 contraceptive drug, device, or product, based on the determination of the health care provider,
18 without cost-sharing; and
19 (iii) A plan shall not require a prescription to trigger coverage of FDA-approved over-the-
20 counter contraceptive drugs, devices, and products, and shall provide point-of-sale coverage for
21 over-the-counter contraceptives at in-network pharmacies without cost-sharing or medical
22 management restrictions;
23 (2) Voluntary sterilization procedures;
24 (3) Clinical services related to the provision or use of contraception, including
25 consultations, examinations, procedures, device insertion, ultrasound, anesthesia, patient
26 education, referrals, and counseling; and
27 (4) Follow-up services related to the drugs, devices, products, and procedures covered
28 under this section, including, but not limited to, management of side effects, counseling for
29 continued adherence, and device insertion and removal.
30 (b) A group or blanket policy subject to this section shall not impose a deductible,
31 coinsurance, copayment or any other cost-sharing requirement on the coverage provided pursuant
32 to this section. For a qualifying high-deductible health plan for a health savings account, the carrier
33 shall establish the plan's cost-sharing for the coverage provided pursuant to this section at the
34 minimum level necessary to preserve the enrollee's ability to claim tax-exempt contributions and
LC000242/SUB A - Page 9 of 15

1 withdrawals from their health savings account under 26 U.S.C. § 223. A health plan shall not
2 impose utilization control or other forms of medical management limiting the supply of FDA-
3 approved contraception that may be dispensed or furnished by a provider or pharmacist, or at a
4 location licensed or otherwise authorized to dispense drugs or supplies in an amount that is less
5 than a twelve (12) month supply, and shall not require an enrollee to make any formal request for
6 such coverage other than a pharmacy claim.
7 (c) Except as otherwise authorized under this section, a group or blanket policy shall not
8 impose any restrictions or delays on the coverage required under this section.
9 (d) Benefits for an enrollee under this section shall be the same for an enrollee's covered
10 spouse or domestic partner and covered non-spouse dependents.
11 (b)(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, any health maintenance
12 corporation may issue to a religious employer an individual or group health insurance contract,
13 plan, or policy that excludes coverage for prescription contraceptive methods that are contrary to
14 the religious employer’s bona fide religious tenets. The exclusion from coverage under this
15 subsection shall not apply to contraceptive services or procedures provided for purposes other than
16 contraception, such as decreasing the risk of ovarian cancer or eliminating symptoms of
17 menopause.
18 (c)(f) As used in this section, “religious employer” means an employer that is a “church or
19 a qualified church-controlled organization” as defined in 26 U.S.C. § 3121.
20 (d)(g) Every religious employer that invokes the exemption provided under this section
21 shall provide written notice to prospective enrollees prior to enrollment with the plan, listing the
22 contraceptive healthcare services the employer refuses to cover for religious reasons.
23 (e)(h) Beginning on the first day of each plan year after April 1, 2019, every health
24 insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage that covers prescription
25 contraception shall not restrict reimbursement for dispensing a covered prescription contraceptive
26 up to three hundred sixty-five (365) days at a time that may be furnished or dispensed all at once
27 or over the course of the twelve (12) month period at the discretion of the prescriber.
28 (i) Nothing in this section shall be construed to exclude coverage for contraceptive drugs,
29 devices, or products for reasons other than contraceptive purposes, such as decreasing the risk of
30 ovarian cancer or eliminating symptoms of menopause, or for contraception that is necessary to
31 preserve the life or health of an enrollee. A plan that violates this section is subject to penalties, in
32 accordance with § 27-41-21. The commissioner may base its determinations on findings from
33 onsite surveys, enrollee or other complaints, financial status, or any other source.
34 (j) The commissioner shall monitor plan compliance in accordance with this section and
LC000242/SUB A - Page 10 of 15

1 shall adopt rules and regulations for the implementation of this section, including the following:
2 (1) In addition to any requirements under state administrative procedures, the
3 commissioner shall engage in a stakeholder process prior to the adoption of rules and regulations
4 that include health care service plans, pharmacy benefit plans, consumer representatives, including
5 those representing youth, low-income people, and communities of color, and other interested
6 parties. The commissioner shall hold stakeholder meetings for stakeholders of different types to
7 ensure sufficient opportunity to consider factors and processes relevant to contraceptive coverage.
8 The commissioner shall provide notice of stakeholder meetings on the commissioner's website, and
9 stakeholder meetings shall be open to the public.
10 (2) The commissioner shall conduct random reviews of each plan and its subcontractors to
11 ensure compliance with this section.
12 (3) The commissioner shall submit an annual report to the general assembly and any other
13 appropriate entity with its findings from the random compliance reviews detailed in this section
14 and any other compliance or implementation efforts. This report shall be made available to the
15 public on the commissioner's website.
16 SECTION 5. Chapter 40-8 of the General Laws entitled "Medical Assistance" is hereby
17 amended by adding thereto the following section:
18 40-8-33. F.D.A. approved prescription contraceptive drugs and devices.
19 (a) Every individual or group health insurance contract, plan, or policy issued pursuant to
20 this chapter that is delivered, issued for delivery, renewed, amended or effective in this state on or
21 after January 1, 2026 shall provide coverage for all of the following services and contraceptive
22 methods. Provided, that nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to mandate or require coverage
23 for the prescription drug RU 486.
24 (1) All FDA-approved contraceptive drugs, devices, and other products. The following
25 applies to this coverage:
26 (i) If there is a therapeutic equivalent of an FDA-approved contraceptive drug, device, or
27 product, the contract shall include either the original FDA-approved contraceptive drug, device, or
28 product or at least one of its therapeutic equivalents. "Therapeutic equivalent" shall have the same
29 definition as that set forth by the FDA;
30 (ii) If the covered therapeutic equivalent versions of a drug, device, or product are not
31 available, or are not tolerated by the patient, or are deemed medically inadvisable, a group or
32 blanket policy shall provide coverage for an alternate therapeutic equivalent version of the
33 contraceptive drug, device, or product, based on the determination of the health care provider,
34 without cost-sharing; and
LC000242/SUB A - Page 11 of 15

1 (iii) A plan shall not require a prescription to trigger coverage of FDA-approved over-the-
2 counter contraceptive drugs, devices, and products, and shall provide point-of-sale coverage for
3 over-the-counter contraceptives at in-network pharmacies without cost-sharing or medical
4 management restrictions;
5 (2) Voluntary sterilization procedures;
6 (3) Clinical services related to the provision or use of contraception, including
7 consultations, examinations, procedures, device insertion, ultrasound, anesthesia, patient
8 education, referrals, and counseling; and
9 (4) Follow-up services related to the drugs, devices, products, and procedures covered
10 under this section, including, but not limited to, management of side effects, counseling for
11 continued adherence, and device insertion and removal.
12 (b) A group or blanket policy subject to this section shall not impose a deductible,
13 coinsurance, copayment or any other cost-sharing requirement on the coverage provided pursuant
14 to this section. For a qualifying high-deductible health plan for a health savings account, the carrier
15 shall establish the plan's cost-sharing for the coverage provided pursuant to this section at the
16 minimum level necessary to preserve the enrollee's ability to claim tax-exempt contributions and
17 withdrawals from their health savings account under 26 U.S.C. § 223. A health plan shall not
18 impose utilization control or other forms of medical management limiting the supply of FDA-
19 approved contraception that may be dispensed or furnished by a provider or pharmacist, or at a
20 location licensed or otherwise authorized to dispense drugs or supplies in an amount that is less
21 than a twelve (12) month supply, and shall not require an enrollee to make any formal request for
22 such coverage other than a pharmacy claim.
23 (c) Except as otherwise authorized under this section, a group or blanket policy shall not
24 impose any restrictions or delays on the coverage required under this section.
25 (d) Benefits for an enrollee under this section shall be the same for an enrollee's covered
26 spouse or domestic partner and covered non-spouse dependents.
27 (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, any health maintenance
28 corporation may issue to a religious employer an individual or group health insurance contract,
29 plan, or policy that excludes coverage for prescription contraceptive methods that are contrary to
30 the religious employer's bona fide religious tenets. The exclusion from coverage under this
31 subsection shall not apply to contraceptive services or procedures provided for purposes other than
32 contraception, such as decreasing the risk of ovarian cancer or eliminating symptoms of
33 menopause.
34 (f) As used in this section, "religious employer" means an employer that is a "church or a
LC000242/SUB A - Page 12 of 15

1 qualified church-controlled organization" as defined in 26 U.S.C. § 3121.
2 (g) Every religious employer that invokes the exemption provided under this section shall
3 provide written notice to prospective enrollees prior to enrollment with the plan, listing the
4 contraceptive health care services the employer refuses to cover for religious reasons.
5 (h) Beginning on the first day of each plan year after April 1, 2024, every health insurance
6 issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage that covers prescription contraception
7 shall not restrict reimbursement for dispensing a covered prescription contraceptive up to three
8 hundred sixty-five (365) days at a time that may be furnished or dispensed all at once or over the

10 (i) Nothing in this section shall be construed to exclude coverage for contraceptive drugs,
11 devices, or products for reasons other than contraceptive purposes, such as decreasing the risk of
12 ovarian cancer or eliminating symptoms of menopause, or for contraception that is necessary to
13 preserve the life or health of an enrollee. A plan that violates this section is subject to penalties, in
14 accordance with § 40-8-9. The executive office of health and human services may base its
15 determinations on findings from onsite surveys, enrollee or other complaints, financial status, or
