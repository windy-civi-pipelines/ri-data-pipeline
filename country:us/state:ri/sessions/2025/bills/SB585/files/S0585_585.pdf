20 (g) An employer who, in good faith relies on the program to verify the employment
21 eligibility of its employees, shall be exempt from liability, or suit arising from any action under this
22 section; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall be construed to limit remedies or
23 relieve obligations and/or penalties under state anti-discrimination laws.
24 28-6.15-4. Severability clause.
25 If any provision of this chapter or the application of a provision, shall for any reason be
26 judged invalid, that judgment shall not affect, impair, or invalidate the remainder of the chapter,

28 controversy giving rise to the judgment.
