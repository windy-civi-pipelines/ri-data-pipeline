It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Section 14-1-6 of the General Laws in Chapter 14-1 entitled "Proceedings in
2 Family Court" is hereby amended to read as follows:
3 14-1-6. Retention of jurisdiction.
4 (a) When the court shall have obtained jurisdiction over any child prior to the child having
5 attained the age of eighteen (18) years by the filing of a petition alleging that the child is wayward
6 or delinquent pursuant to § 14-1-5, the child shall, except as specifically provided in this chapter,
7 continue under the jurisdiction of the court until he or she becomes nineteen (19) years of age,

10 eighteenth (18th) birthday by the filing of a miscellaneous petition or a petition alleging that the
11 child is wayward, delinquent, dependent, neglected, or abused pursuant to §§ 14-1-5 and 40-11-7
12 or 42-72-14, the child shall, except as specifically provided in this chapter, continue under the
13 jurisdiction of the court until he or she becomes eighteen (18) years of age; provided, that at least
14 six (6) months prior to a child turning eighteen (18) years of age, the court shall require the
15 department of children, youth and families to provide a description of the transition services
16 including the child’s housing, health insurance, education and/or employment plan; available
17 mentors and continuing support services, including workforce supports and employment services
18 afforded the child in placement; or a detailed explanation as to the reason those services were not

1 offered. As part of the transition planning, the child shall be informed by the department of the
2 opportunity to voluntarily agree to extended care and placement by the department and legal
3 supervision by the court until age twenty-one (21). The details of a child’s transition plan shall be
4 developed in consultation with the child, wherever possible, and approved by the court prior to the
5 dismissal of an abuse, neglect, dependency, or miscellaneous petition before the child’s twenty-
6 first birthday.
7 (c) A child, who is in foster care on their eighteenth birthday due to the filing of a
8 miscellaneous petition or a petition alleging that the child is wayward, delinquent, dependent,
9 neglected, or abused pursuant to § 14-1-5, § 40-11-7, or § 42-72-14, may voluntarily elect to
10 continue responsibility for care and placement from DCYF and to remain under the legal
11 supervision of the court as a young adult until age twenty-one (21), provided:
12 (1) The young adult was in the legal custody of the department at age eighteen (18); and
13 (2) The young adult is participating in at least one of the following:
14 (i) Completing the requirements to receive a high school diploma or GED;
15 (ii) Completing a secondary education or a program leading to an equivalent credential;

17 (iii) Participating in a job-training program or an activity designed to promote or remove
18 barriers to employment;
19 (iv) Is employed for at least eighty (80) hours per month; or
20 (v) Is incapable of doing any of the foregoing due to a medical condition that is regularly
21 updated and documented in the case plan.
22 (d) A former foster child who was adopted or placed in guardianship with an adoption
23 assistance agreement or a guardianship assistance agreement that was executed on or after his or
24 her sixteenth birthday and prior to his or her eighteenth birthday, or a former foster child who was
25 reunified prior to their eighteenth birthday and reunification is not successful, may voluntarily agree
26 to extended care and placement by the department and legal supervision by the court until age
27 twenty-one (21) if the young adult satisfies the requirements in subsection (c)(2). Provided,
28 however, the department retains the right to review the request and first attempt to address the
29 issues through the adoption assistance agreement by providing post adoptive or post guardianship
30 support services to the young adult and his or her adoptive or guardianship family.
31 (e) Upon the request of the young adult, who voluntarily agreed to the extension of care
32 and placement by the department and legal supervision by the court, pursuant to subsections (c)
33 and (d) of this section, the court’s legal supervision and the department’s responsibility for care
34 and placement may be terminated. Provided, however, the young adult may request reinstatement
LC000164 - Page 2 of 6

1 of responsibility and resumption of the court’s legal supervision at any time prior to his or her
2 twenty-first birthday if the young adult meets the requirements set forth in subsection (c)(2). If the
3 department wishes to terminate the court’s legal supervision and its responsibility for care and
4 placement, it may file a motion for good cause. The court may exercise its discretion to terminate
5 legal supervision over the young adult at any time.
6 (f) With the consent of the person previously under the court’s supervision, the court may
7 reopen, extend, or retain its jurisdiction beyond that person’s twenty-first birthday until his or her
8 twenty-second birthday or until September 30, 2021, whichever date occurs first, under the
9 following circumstances:
10 (1) The person aged out of DCYF care or left foster care during the COVID-19 public
11 health emergency, defined as beginning on January 27, 2020, and is entitled to extended benefits

25 birthday by the filing of a miscellaneous petition or a petition alleging that the child is dependent,
26 neglected, and/or abused pursuant to §§ 14-1-5, and 40-11-7, or 42-72-14.
27 (h) The department of children, youth and families shall work collaboratively with the

30 who come under the court’s jurisdiction pursuant to a petition alleging that the child is dependent,
31 neglected, and/or abused and who are seriously emotionally disturbed or developmentally delayed
32 pursuant to § 42-72-5(b)(24)(v). This plan shall be a joint plan presented to the court by the

LC000164 - Page 3 of 6

1 developmental disabilities and hospitals’ community or residential service level, health insurance
2 option, education plan, available mentors, continuing support services, workforce supports and
3 employment services, and the plan shall be provided to the court at least twelve (12) months prior
4 to discharge. At least three (3) months prior to discharge, the plan shall identify the specific
5 placement for the child, if a residential placement is needed. The court shall monitor the transition
6 plan. In the instance where the department of behavioral healthcare, developmental disabilities and
7 hospitals has not made timely referrals to appropriate placements and services, the department of
8 children, youth and families may initiate referrals.
9 (i) The parent and/or guardian and/or guardian ad litem of a child who is seriously

12 be entitled to a transition hearing, as needed, when the child reaches the age of twenty (20) if no
13 appropriate transition plan has been submitted to the court by the department of children, youth and
14 families and the department of behavioral healthcare, developmental disabilities and hospitals. The
15 family court shall require that the department of behavioral healthcare, developmental disabilities
16 and hospitals shall immediately identify a liaison to work with the department of children, youth
17 and families until the child reaches the age of twenty-one (21) and an immediate transition plan be
18 submitted if the following facts are found:
19 (1) No suitable transition plan has been presented to the court addressing the levels of
20 service appropriate to meet the needs of the child as identified by the department of behavioral
21 healthcare, developmental disabilities and hospitals; or
22 (2) No suitable housing options, health insurance, educational plan, available mentors,
23 continuing support services, workforce supports, and employment services have been identified for

25 (j) In any case where the court shall not have acquired jurisdiction over any person prior to
26 the person’s eighteenth (18th) birthday by the filing of a petition alleging that the person had
27 committed an offense, but a petition alleging that the person had committed an offense that would
28 be punishable as a felony if committed by an adult has been filed before that person attains the age
29 of nineteen (19) years of age, that person shall, except as specifically provided in this chapter, be
30 subject to the jurisdiction of the court until he or she becomes nineteen (19) years of age, unless
31 discharged prior to turning nineteen (19).
32 (k) In any case where the court shall not have acquired jurisdiction over any person prior
33 to the person attaining the age of nineteen (19) years by the filing of a petition alleging that the
34 person had committed an offense prior to the person attaining the age of eighteen (18) years that
LC000164 - Page 4 of 6

1 would be punishable as a felony if committed by an adult, that person shall be referred to the court
2 that had jurisdiction over the offense if it had been committed by an adult. The court shall have
3 jurisdiction to try that person for the offense committed prior to the person attaining the age of
4 eighteen (18) years and, upon conviction, may impose a sentence not exceeding the maximum
5 penalty provided for the conviction of that offense.
6 (l) In any case where the court has certified and adjudicated a child in accordance with the
7 provisions of §§ 14-1-7.2 and 14-1-7.3, the jurisdiction of the court shall encompass the power and
8 authority to sentence the child to a period in excess of the age of nineteen (19) years. However, in
9 no case shall the sentence be in excess of the maximum penalty provided by statute for the
10 conviction of the offense.
11 (m) Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the jurisdiction of other courts over
12 offenses committed by any person after he or she reaches the age of eighteen (18) years.
13 SECTION 2. This act shall take effect upon passage.
