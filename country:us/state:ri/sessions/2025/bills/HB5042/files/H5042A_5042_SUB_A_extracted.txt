10 percentage rate, and the initial issuance of any identification card.
11 (b) Before a licensee shall deposit, with any regulated institution or other insured-deposit-
12 taking institution organized under the laws of the United States, a check cashed by the licensee, the
13 check must be endorsed with the name under which the licensee is doing business and must include
14 the words “licensed check cashing services”.
15 (c) The licensee shall provide a receipt for each transaction for the benefit of a customer.
16 (d) Each check casher shall also post a list of valid identification that is acceptable in lieu
17 of identification provided by the check casher. The information required by this section shall be
18 clear, legible, and in letters not less than one-half (½) inch in height. The information shall be
19 posted in a conspicuous location in the unobstructed view of the public within the check casher’s
20 premises. Failure to post information as required by this section, or the imposition of fees or
21 identification requirements contrary to the information posted, shall constitute a deceptive trade
22 practice under chapter 13.1 of title 6.

29 (b) Each deferred deposit shall be made pursuant to a written agreement that has been
30 signed by the customer and by the check casher or an authorized representative of the check casher.
31 The written agreement shall contain a statement of the total amount of any fees charged for the
32 deferred deposit, expressed both in United States currency and as an annual percentage rate (APR),
33 as required by federal regulations. The written agreement shall authorize the check casher to defer
34 deposit of the personal check until a specific date no less than thirteen (13) days from the date the
LC000398/SUB A - Page 11 of 13

1 written agreement was signed and executed. The written agreement shall not permit the check
2 casher to accept collateral.
3 (c) A rollover is an extension or deferral of the payment due date of a deferred deposit
4 transaction for the payment of only an additional fee.
5 (d) The maximum amount of a single customer’s check is five hundred dollars ($500).
