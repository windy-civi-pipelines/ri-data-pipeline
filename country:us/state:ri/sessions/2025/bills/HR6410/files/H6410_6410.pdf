URGING THE CITY OF PROVIDENCE TO FOLLOW THE FIRST SOURCE HIRING
ORDINANCE MANDATES
Introduced By: Representatives Morales, and Batista
Date Introduced: June 11, 2025
Referred To: House Municipal Government & Housing
1 WHEREAS, Chapter 21, Article III1/2, sec 21-91.1 of the Code of Ordinances of the City
2 of Providence ordained that "all significant public investments of taxpayer dollars require that
3 employers utilize the Providence First Source List for jobs created as a result of the public
4 investment"; and
5 WHEREAS, It is furthermore required that the failure of businesses to notify First Source
6 about job openings, the failure to notify about job openings before advertising to the public, and
7 the failure to allow access to relevant records shall result in termination or suspension of aid or
8 funding, termination of contract recovery of any public benefit, withholding of future payments,
9 and suspension or termination of doing business or receiving funds from the City for a minimum
10 of two years; and
11 WHEREAS, Businesses in the City of Providence are not all complying with the
12 requirements of the Ordinance, yet the City of Providence has failed to uphold the provisions of
13 this Ordinance by refusing to enforce the provisions and penalties outlined in the First Source
14 Ordinance; and
15 WHEREAS, Language specified within sec 21-91.1(8) of the Ordinance states that
16 "Unless the City's citizens are provided with an opportunity to be hired on projects that their tax
17 dollars fund, unemployment will remain high, property values will further decline, foreclosures
18 will increase, crime will also increase, and the City will not be able to pay for or provide essential
19 public works projects, social programs, and incentives to the private sector that will induce

1 economic activity"; and
2 WHEREAS, First Source Providence was established in 1986 with the sole purpose of
3 connecting working class, low-income, City residents with employers in the City of Providence
4 with job opportunities and job training; however, there are many available and qualified residents,
5 who live and pay taxes in the City of Providence who need jobs and are not being provided with
6 the opportunities required by the City's duly adopted Code of Ordinances; now, therefore be it
7 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
8 strongly urges the City of Providence to follow the First Source Hiring Ordinance mandates and
9 enforce the rules and/or penalties on those businesses not complying; and be it further
10 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
11 transmit duly certified copies of this resolution to the Honorable Brett Smiley, Mayor of the City
12 of Providence, the Honorable Rachel Miller, President of the Providence City Council, and
13 Wedley Thelemaque, First Source Director, City of Providence.
