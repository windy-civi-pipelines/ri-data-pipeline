4 (a) The state building code standards committee (“committee”) shall adopt an energy
5 conservation code that shall be based on appropriate nationally and internationally recognized
6 models, and shall promulgate and administer the energy conservation code. The energy
7 conservation code shall contain provisions pertaining to, but not limited to, the construction of

9 buildings, and the orientation of buildings on their sites. The state energy conservation code shall
10 at a minimum:
11 (1) For residential or commercial buildings, meet or exceed the most recently published
12 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC), or achieve equivalent or greater energy savings.
13 The state building code standards committee shall revise the state energy conservation code to
14 comply with this requirement within one year of any update to the International Energy
15 Conservation Code; provided, however, that the 2021 IECC published by the International Code
16 Council shall not be adopted and the 2024 IECC published by the International Code Council shall
17 be adopted within (3) three months of its release; and provided further that, future versions of the
18 IECC published by the International Code Council between 2025-2029 shall only be adopted by
19 the state building code standards committee upon a state department of business regulation

1 determination, in conjunction with the state building code standards committee, that the particular
2 version of the IECC is more energy efficient that the version then in use in the state. The department
3 of business regulation shall make the determination within three (3) months of the release of any
4 update to the IECC between 2025-2029.
5 (2) Within one year of the release of the 2024 International Energy Conservation Code, the
6 state building code standards committee shall revise the state energy conservation code to meet or
7 exceed the 2024 International Energy Conservation Code’s electric readiness provisions.
8 (b) No later than six (6) months after the adoption of the building code(s) described in
9 subsection (a) of this section, the state building code standards committee shall develop a plan to
10 achieve compliance with the building code(s) described in subsection (a) of this section in at least
11 ninety percent (90%) of new and renovated residential and commercial building space in the state.
12 Such plan shall include active training and enforcement programs and measurement of the rate of
13 compliance each year.
