4 (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any health insurance contract, plan,
5 or policy delivered or issued for delivery or renewed in this state, except contracts providing
6 supplemental coverage to Medicare or other governmental programs, shall provide coverage for
7 the following services and contraceptive methods:
8 (1) United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved contraceptive drugs,
9 devices and other products; provided, however, that coverage shall not be required for male
10 condoms or FDA-approved oral contraceptive drugs that do not have a therapeutic equivalent; and
11 provided further, that:
12 (i) If the FDA has approved one or more therapeutic equivalents of a contraceptive drug,
13 device or product, the office of the health insurance commissioner shall not be required to include
14 all such therapeutically equivalent versions in its formulary as long as at least one is included and
15 covered without cost-sharing and in accordance with this section; and
16 (ii) If there is a therapeutic equivalent of a drug, device or other product for an FDA-
17 approved contraceptive method, the insurer may provide coverage for more than one drug, device
18 or other product and may impose cost-sharing requirements as long as at least one drug, device or
19 other product for that method is available without cost-sharing; provided, however, that if an

1 individual’s provider recommends a particular FDA-approved contraceptive based on a medical
2 determination with respect to that individual, regardless of whether the contraceptive has a
3 therapeutic equivalent, the insurer shall provide coverage for the prescribed contraceptive drug,
4 device or product without cost-sharing;
5 (2) FDA-approved emergency contraception available over-the-counter, whether with a
6 prescription or dispensed consistent with the requirements of current law;

8 (i) For not more than a three (3) month period for the first time the prescription
9 contraceptive is dispensed to the covered person; and
10 (ii) For not more than a twelve (12) month period for any subsequent dispensing of the
11 same prescription, which may be dispensed all at once or over the course of the twelve (12) month
12 period, regardless of whether the covered person was enrolled in a plan or policy under this chapter
13 at the time the prescription contraceptive was first dispensed; provided, however, that the insured
14 may not fill more than one twelve (12) month prescription in a single dispensing per plan year;
15 (4) Voluntary female sterilization procedures;
16 (5) Patient education and counseling on contraception; and
17 (6) Follow-up services related to the drugs, devices, products and procedures covered under
18 this subsection including, but not limited to, management of side effects, counseling for continued
19 adherence and device insertion and removal.
20 (b) For purposes of this section, the following words shall have the following meanings
21 unless the context clearly requires otherwise:
22 (1) “Provider” means an individual or facility licensed, certified, or otherwise authorized
23 or permitted by law to administer health care in the ordinary course of business or professional

26 (i) Approved by the FDA as safe and effective;
27 (ii) Pharmaceutically equivalent to another contraceptive drug, device, or product in that it

31 (iii) Assigned the same therapeutic equivalence code as another contraceptive drug, device
32 or product by the FDA.

2 delays in the coverage; provided, however, that reasonable medical management techniques may
3 be applied to coverage within a method category, as defined by the FDA, but not across types of
4 methods.
5 (d) Benefits for an enrollee under this section shall be the same for the enrollee’s covered
6 spouse and covered dependents.
7 (e) Nothing in this section shall be construed to exclude coverage for contraceptive drugs,
8 devices, products, and procedures as prescribed by a provider for reasons other than contraceptive
9 purposes including, but not limited to, decreasing the risk of ovarian cancer, eliminating symptoms
10 of menopause or providing contraception that is necessary to preserve the life or health of the
11 enrollee or the enrollee’s covered spouse or covered dependents.

13 section.
