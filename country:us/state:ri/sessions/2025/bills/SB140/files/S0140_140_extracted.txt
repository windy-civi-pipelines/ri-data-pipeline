6 time off their term or terms of incarceration for good behavior.
7 (b) The director, or the director’s designee, shall keep a record of the conduct of each

11 to discipline, and is serving a sentence imposed for violation of sexual offenses under § 11-37-4, §
12 11-37-6, § 11-37-8, or § 11-9-1.3 there shall, with the consent of the director of the department of

18 by the prisoner of subsequent good behavior and disposition to reform.

26 than one month and not under sentence to imprisonment for life has participated faithfully in
27 programs that have been determined by the director or the director’s designee to address that
28 prisoner’s individual needs that are related to his/her criminal behavior, there may, with the consent
29 of the director and upon the recommendation of the assistant director, rehabilitative services, be
30 deducted from the term or terms of the prisoner up to an additional five (5) days a month.

3 felony is murder or sexual assault), § 11-23-1, § 11-26-1.4, § 11-37-2, § 11-37-8.1, or § 11-37-8.3,
4 or § 31-27-2.2 shall upon serving three years of their probation sentence be eligible to earn time
5 off their term or terms of the probation sentence for compliance with court-ordered terms and
6 conditions of probation. Calculation of these credits shall commence upon the probationer’s
7 completion of all terms of incarceration.
8 (2) The director, or the director’s designee, shall keep a record of the conduct of each
9 probationer. For each month that the probationer has not had a judicial finding of a violation of

13 month’s compliance with the terms and conditions of his or her probation.

15 eligible to earn probation compliance credits. In the event there is a judicial determination that the
16 probationer did not violate his or her terms and conditions of probation, credit will be awarded

18 determination that the probationer did violate his or her terms and conditions of probation, the
