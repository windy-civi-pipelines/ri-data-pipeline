11 as defined in § 42-63.1-2 and any marketing organization that reserves or arranges the transfer of
12 occupancy or accommodations the reservation or transfer of which is subject to this chapter.
13 Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, where said reservation or transfer of occupancy
14 is done using a room reseller or reseller, the application of the sales and use tax under §§ 44-18-18
15 and 44-18-20, and the hotel tax under § 44-18-36.1 shall be as follows: The room reseller or reseller
16 is required to register with, and shall collect and pay to, the tax administrator the sales and use and
17 hotel taxes, with said taxes being calculated upon the amount of rental and other fees paid by the
18 occupant to the room reseller or reseller, less the amount of any rental and other fees paid by the
19 room reseller or reseller to the hotel. The hotel shall collect and pay to the tax administrator said
20 taxes upon the amount of rental and other fees paid to the hotel by the room reseller or reseller
21 and/or the occupant. No assessment shall be made by the tax administrator against a hotel because
22 of an incorrect remittance of the taxes under this chapter by a room reseller or reseller. No
23 assessment shall be made by the tax administrator against a room reseller or reseller because of an
24 incorrect remittance of the taxes under this chapter by a hotel. If the hotel has paid the taxes imposed
25 under this chapter, the occupant and/or room reseller or reseller, as applicable, shall reimburse the
26 hotel for said taxes. If the room reseller or reseller has paid said taxes, the occupant shall reimburse
27 the room reseller or reseller for said taxes. Each hotel and room reseller or reseller shall add and
28 collect, from the occupant or the room reseller or the reseller, the full amount of the taxes imposed
29 on the rental and other fees. When added to the rental and other fees, the taxes shall be a debt owed
30 by the occupant to the hotel or room reseller or reseller, as applicable, and shall be recoverable at
31 law in the same manner as other debts. The amount of the taxes collected by the hotel and/or room
32 reseller or reseller from the occupant under this chapter shall be stated and charged separately from
33 the rental and other fees, and shall be shown separately on all records thereof, whether made at the
34 time the transfer of occupancy occurs, or on any evidence of the transfer issued or used by the hotel
LC001645 - Page 2 of 6

1 or the room reseller or the reseller. A room reseller or reseller shall not be required to disclose to
2 the occupant the amount of tax charged by the hotel; provided, however, the room reseller or
3 reseller shall represent to the occupant that the separately stated taxes charged by the room reseller
4 or reseller include taxes charged by the hotel. No person shall operate a hotel in this state, or act as

7 (ii) “Travel package” means a room, or rooms, bundled with one or more other, separate
8 components of travel such as air transportation, car rental, or similar items, which travel package
9 is charged to the customer or occupant for a single, retail price. When the room occupancy is
10 bundled for a single consideration, with other property, services, amusement charges, or any other
11 items, the separate sale of which would not otherwise be subject to tax under this chapter, the entire
12 single consideration shall be treated as the rental or other fees for room occupancy subject to tax
13 under this chapter; provided, however, that where the amount of the rental, or other fees for room
14 occupancy is stated separately from the price of such other property, services, amusement charges,
15 or other items, on any sales slip, invoice, receipt, or other statement given the occupant, and such
16 rental and other fees are determined by the tax administrator to be reasonable in relation to the
17 value of such other property, services, amusement charges, or other items, only such separately
18 stated rental and other fees will be subject to tax under this chapter. The value of the transfer of any
19 room, or rooms, bundled as part of a travel package may be determined by the tax administrator
20 from the room reseller’s and/or reseller’s and/or hotel’s books and records that are kept in the
21 regular course of business.
22 (5) Investigation, Guard, and Armored Car Services (561611, 561612 & 561613).

25 remit Rhode Island sales and use tax.
