4 (a) “Rhode Island taxable income” means federal taxable income as determined under the
5 Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., not including the increase in the basic, standard-
6 deduction amount for married couples filing joint returns as provided in the Jobs and Growth Tax
7 Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 and the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of
8 2001 (EGTRRA), and as modified by the modifications in § 44-30-12.
9 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of §§ 44-30-1 and 44-30-2, for tax years beginning on
10 or after January 1, 2001, a Rhode Island personal income tax is imposed upon the Rhode Island
11 taxable income of residents and nonresidents, including estates and trusts, at the rate of twenty-five
12 and one-half percent (25.5%) for tax year 2001, and twenty-five percent (25%) for tax year 2002
13 and thereafter of the federal income tax rates, including capital gains rates and any other special
14 rates for other types of income, except as provided in § 44-30-2.7, which were in effect immediately

22 minimum tax for federal tax purposes, the taxpayer shall determine if he or she has a Rhode Island
23 alternative minimum tax. The Rhode Island alternative minimum tax shall be computed by
24 multiplying the federal tentative minimum tax without allowing for the increased exemptions under
25 the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (as redetermined on federal form 6251
26 Alternative Minimum Tax-Individuals) by twenty-five and one-half percent (25.5%) for tax year
27 2001, and twenty-five percent (25%) for tax year 2002 and thereafter, and comparing the product
28 to the Rhode Island tax as computed otherwise under this section. The excess shall be the taxpayer’s
29 Rhode Island alternative minimum tax.
30 (1) For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2005, and thereafter, the exemption
31 amount for alternative minimum tax, for Rhode Island purposes, shall be adjusted for inflation by
32 the tax administrator in the manner prescribed for adjustment by the commissioner of Internal
33 Revenue in 26 U.S.C. § 1(f).
34 (2) For the period January 1, 2007, through December 31, 2007, and thereafter, Rhode

6 said exemption(s).
7 (D) In the case of any taxpayer whose adjusted gross income, as modified for Rhode Island
8 purposes pursuant to § 44-30-12, for the taxable year exceeds one hundred seventy-five thousand
9 dollars ($175,000), the exemption amount shall be reduced by the applicable percentage. The term
10 “applicable percentage” means twenty (20) percentage points for each five thousand dollars
11 ($5,000) (or fraction thereof) by which the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income for the taxable year
12 exceeds one hundred seventy-five thousand dollars ($175,000).

18 (II) The cost-of-living adjustment with a base year of 2000.
19 (III) For the purposes of this section, the cost-of-living adjustment for any calendar year is
20 the percentage (if any) by which the consumer price index for the preceding calendar year exceeds
21 the consumer price index for the base year. The consumer price index for any calendar year is the
22 average of the consumer price index as of the close of the twelve-month (12) period ending on
23 August 31, of such calendar year.
24 (IV) For the purpose of this section the term “consumer price index” means the last
25 consumer price index for all urban consumers published by the department of labor. For the purpose
26 of this section the revision of the consumer price index that is most consistent with the consumer
27 price index for calendar year 1986 shall be used.
28 (V) If any increase determined under this section is not a multiple of fifty dollars ($50.00),
29 such increase shall be rounded to the next lower multiple of fifty dollars ($50.00). In the case of a
30 married individual filing separate return, if any increase determined under this section is not a
31 multiple of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), such increase shall be rounded to the next lower multiple
32 of twenty-five dollars ($25.00).
