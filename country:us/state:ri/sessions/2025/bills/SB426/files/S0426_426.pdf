5 more than seventy-five (75) working days in a calendar year without interruption of pension
6 benefits. Pension payments, however, are suspended when that period is exceeded. This seventy-
7 five-day (75) rule shall not apply to police officers, as defined in ยง 28-9.2-3, or any peace officer

11 annuity temporarily suspended) the member is not eligible for pension credit for the additional
12 service, nor is the member required to make pension contributions for this service; provided, that
13 any retired member of the system is permitted to serve as an elected city or town council member
14 or school committee member and continues to be eligible for and receive the retirement allowance
15 for service other than that as a council member or school committee member.
