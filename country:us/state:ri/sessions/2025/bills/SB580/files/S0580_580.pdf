16 (c) A landlord terminating a tenancy with a thirty (30) day notice without cause as
17 authorized by § 34-18-37, shall not reset the rent for the next tenancy in an amount greater than
18 four percent (4%) above the previous rent.

3 (1) The tenant leaves on their own volition and the landlord rents to a new tenant;
4 (2) The landlord is providing reduced rent to the tenant as part of a federal, state or local
5 program or subsidy; or
6 (3) The landlord is granted an exemption by the secretary of housing. A landlord may be

16 (f)(1) A landlord that increases rent in violation of this section or a landlord which

21 if appropriate.
22 (3) In addition to the remedies provided in subsections (f)(1) and (f)(2) of this section, if
23 the landlord's conduct is shown to be motivated by malice or ill will, or when the landlord's actions
24 are reckless or callous indifference to the requirements of this section, the court may award punitive
25 damage.
26 (g) A tenant is entitled to recovery under this section if the tenant commences an action
27 asserting the claim within one year after the tenant knew or should have known the landlord
28 terminated the tenancy in violation of this section.
29 (h) This section does not create a right to increase rent that does not otherwise exist.
30 (i) This section does not require a landlord to compromise, justify or reduce a rent increase
31 that the landlord otherwise is entitled to impose.
32 (j) The secretary of housing shall enforce the provisions of this section.
