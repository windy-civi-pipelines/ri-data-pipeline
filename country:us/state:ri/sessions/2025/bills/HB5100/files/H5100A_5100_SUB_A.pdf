11 23-28.1-6. Applicability to new or existing structures.
12 (a) All regulations contained in this code apply to all structures unless specifically
13 exempted. Prior to a building permit, other than a foundation permit, being issued, all plans for
14 buildings regulated under this code shall be submitted to the authority having jurisdiction. The
15 authority having jurisdiction shall approve or disapprove the completed set of plans within a
16 reasonable time not to exceed fifteen (15) days for fire alarm, smoke detection and/or carbon
17 monoxide detector plans. The authority having jurisdiction shall further approve or disapprove a
18 completed set of plans, covering any other project, within the specific time lines recommended by
19 the state fire marshal, and established on or before October 15, 2010 within the rules and regulations
20 of the state fire safety code board. In no case shall the authority having jurisdictional review of a
21 completed set of plans exceed ninety (90) days to complete that review without the express written
22 approval of the state fire marshal. The failure of an authority having jurisdiction to comply within
23 the timelines established pursuant to this section, may result in the issuance of a building permit.
24 The above examination of plans may be waived by the authority having jurisdiction when the plans
25 for the erection or alteration of a building are prepared by a professional engineer or architect,
26 licensed and/or registered by the State of Rhode Island, and the professional engineer or architect
27 has stated in a written, signed and stamped document, that he or she has supervised the preparation
28 of the applicable architectural, structural, electrical, mechanical, fire alarm and/or sprinkler design
29 contract documents, and that he or she will review and approve all working drawings for
30 construction, conduct on-site supervision of the construction process throughout the project, and
31 that the project shall, to the best of his or her knowledge conform to all provisions of the fire safety
32 code, and all rules and regulations, formal interpretations and blanket variances adopted under its
33 provisions. When a change of use or type of occupancy is made in an existing building, the building
34 shall conform to the requirements established by the rehabilitation building and fire code for
LC000705/SUB A - Page 3 of 17

1 existing buildings and structures, or if the rehabilitation building and fire code for existing
2 structures is not applicable, to the requirements for new structures as related to the proposed use or
3 type of occupancy.
4 (b) In existing structures, since it is not always practical or efficient to strictly apply all of
5 the provisions of the code, the authority having jurisdiction shall have the power to implement and
6 enforce the provisions of the code as provided for in the Uniform Fire Code (NFPA 1) and the Life
7 Safety Code (NFPA 101) with annexes, as applicable to existing structures, consistent with such
8 rules and regulations as may be adopted and such decisions as may be rendered by the Fire Safety
9 Code Board of Appeal and Review.
10 (c) Application of the code to new and existing structures shall be consistent with such
11 blanket variances, variances, and rules, as may be approved by the Fire Safety Code Board of
12 Appeal and Review, and such modifications as may be issued in writing by the authority having
13 jurisdiction, in accordance with NFPA 101, with annexes.
14 (d) Specific exemptions. SAVE Units as defined in § 45-24-31 and permitted pursuant to
15 § 23-27.3-111.0, whether currently available or to be provided in the future, that are allowed
16 pursuant to § 45-24-37, or on an emergency basis as set forth in § 45-24-78, are exempt from the
17 provisions of this chapter as well as related codes and regulations promulgated and enforced under
18 this chapter.

LC000705/SUB A - Page 12 of 17

1 listed may be presented by the property owner to the zoning board of review or to a local official
2 or agency charged with administration and enforcement of the ordinance for an evaluation and
3 determination of whether the proposed use is of a similar type, character, and intensity as a listed
4 permitted use. Upon such determination, the proposed use may be considered to be a permitted use.

6 uses within all residential zoning use districts of a municipality and all industrial and commercial
7 zoning use districts except where residential use is prohibited for public health or safety reasons:

3 development of at least fifty percent (50%) of the existing gross floor area into residential units,

5 except where such is prohibited by environmental land use restrictions recorded on the property by
6 the state of Rhode Island department of environmental management or the United States
7 Environmental Protection Agency preventing the conversion to residential use.

22 and has access to public sewer and water service or has access to adequate private water, such as a
23 well, and wastewater treatment system(s) approved by the relevant state agency for the entire
24 development, as applicable. The density proposed shall be determined to meet all public health and
25 safety standards.
26 (3) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, for adaptive reuse projects,

32 and shall be considered legal nonconforming, and any rooftop construction shall be included within
33 the height exemption.

13 regulation to the contrary, a municipality, upon a declaration of emergency introduced by the
14 mayor, town administrator, or other equivalent chief executive officer, and approved by the
15 municipal council, which may be in the form of a resolution, may suspend application and

21 the aftermath of a natural or man-made disaster.
22 (c) Such a declaration of emergency shall only be valid for thirty (30) days, with the right
23 to renew the declaration, by vote of the municipal council, for another thirty (30) day period. The

LC000705/SUB A - Page 15 of 17

1 code sections by right through the passage of a zoning ordinance amendment in accordance with
2 the provisions of §§ 45-24-50 through 45-24-53 and are permitted pursuant to § 23-27.3-111.0.
3 SECTION 6. Section 45-24.3-4 of the General Laws in Chapter 45-24.3 entitled "Housing

6 (a) Every portion of a building or its premises used or intended to be used for the purpose

9 building was constructed, altered, or repaired, and irrespective of any permits or licenses issued for
10 the use or occupancy of the dwelling and dwelling premises or structure, for the construction or
11 repair of the dwelling or structure, or for the installation or repair of dwelling equipment prior to

13 occupancy of all dwellings and structures, and does not replace or modify standards otherwise

16 chapter as provided by § 45-24.3-19.
17 (b) Matters governed by and conforming to the provisions of the State Building Code (§
18 23-27.3-100.0 et seq.) shall prevail for all structures, dwellings, and dwelling units constructed,
19 altered or repaired since July 1, 1977, providing the structure, dwelling or dwelling units conform
20 in their entirety to the prevailing edition of the building codes in effect at the time of construction
21 or occupancy, as evidenced by the date of issuance of a building permit issuance or date of issuance
22 of a certificate of occupancy.
23 (c) Except as specifically provided, the provisions of this chapter shall not apply to SAVE
24 Units as defined in § 45-24-31 that are permitted pursuant to § 45-24-37 or § 45-24-78 and which
25 comply with § 23-27.3-111.0.
26 SECTION 7. This act shall take effect upon passage.
