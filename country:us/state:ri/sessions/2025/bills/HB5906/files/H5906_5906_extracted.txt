11 standard;

13 independent clearance inspection; and (iii) Information about how to give notice of deteriorating
14 conditions;
15 (5) Correct lead hazards within thirty (30) days after notification from the tenant of a
16 dwelling unit with an at-risk occupant, or as provided for by § 34-18-22.
17 (b) New property owners of a pre-1978 rental dwelling that is occupied by an at-risk
18 occupant shall have up to sixty (60) days to meet requirements for lead hazard mitigation, if those
19 requirements were not met by the previous owner at the time of transfer, provided that the new
1 property owner has the property visually inspected within thirty (30) business days after assuming
2 ownership to determine conformity with the lead hazard control standard.
3 (c) The requirements for lead hazard mitigation shall apply to the first change in ownership
4 or tenancy after November 1, 2005; provided further, that unless requested and agreed to by an at-
5 risk occupant, meeting the lead hazard mitigation standard shall not be construed to authorize a

7 tenancy continuously thereafter, to vacate a rental unit temporarily or otherwise.
8 (d) If the tenant receives no response to the notification to the property owner of
9 deteriorating conditions affecting lead hazards, if the response is in the tenant’s opinion
10 unsatisfactory, or if the remedy performed is in the tenant’s opinion unsatisfactory, the tenant may
11 request a review of the matter by the housing resources commission department of health. After its
12 review of the matter, the housing resources commission department of health shall either send

25 children who are lead poisoned in any of the exempted dwelling units as referred to in subsection
26 (e) of this section.
27 (g) Nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent an owner who is seeking to
28 obtain lead liability insurance coverage in the policy from complying with the provisions of this
29 chapter, by securing and maintaining a valid and in force letter of compliance or conformance in
30 force.
31 42-128.1-11. Enforcement.
32 (a) The standards for lead hazard control and for lead hazard mitigation in pre-1978

LC002034 - Page 2 of 5
1 title 45.
2 (b) Minimum Housing Standards and Housing Maintenance and Occupancy Code. In
3 order to establish consistency between state and local programs pertaining to enforcement of

5 of identifying instances of noncompliance with this chapter and enforcing the requirements of this
6 chapter, the department of health shall undertake consistent with § 34-18-58. following provisions
7 regarding Minimum Housing Standards and the Housing Maintenance and Occupancy Code shall
8 be effective:
9 (1) The ordinances, rules, and regulations for “Minimum Housing Standards” adopted
10 pursuant to § 45-24.2-3 shall, on or before November 1, 2005, include provisions for lead hazard
11 control.
12 (2) The Housing Maintenance and Occupancy Code, established by chapter 24.3 of title
13 45, shall, effective November 1, 2005, include provisions consistent with a continuing and ongoing
14 responsibility for lead hazard mitigation as required by the department of health standards.
15 (c) In any private action where a property owner is found to have violated § 42-128.1-1 et
16 seq., or any rules or regulations derived therefrom, the property owner is subject to damages, which
17 may include double or treble the actual damages found, as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees.
18 Nothing herein should be construed as excluding other remedies in law or equity.
19 42-128.1-14. Escrow account.
20 (a) Notwithstanding any general law, public law, special law, or any agreement, whether
21 written or oral, a tenant may file a petition to deposit the tenant’s rent in an escrow account in the
22 district court with jurisdiction of the leased property, whenever the leased property is not compliant
23 with the risk reduction provisions of this chapter, including, but not limited to, the requirement for
24 a valid certificate of conformance, any rules or regulations derived therefrom, or upon any licensed
25 inspector’s finding of the existence of lead hazards in the property. Upon the petition to the district
26 court, and after notice to the owner of the premises and a hearing thereon, the district court shall
27 order the deposit of the tenant’s rent within the registry of the court, consistent with district court
28 rules of procedure, upon a determination that the leased property is not compliant with the risk
29 reduction provisions of this chapter, or upon any licensed inspector’s finding of the existence of
30 lead hazards in the property.
31 (b) Other rights or remedies. The right of a tenant to deposit rent in the registry of the
32 court does not preclude the tenant from pursuing any other right or remedy available to the tenant
33 at law or equity.
34 (c) Release of funds within the registry of the court. Money deposited within the registry
LC002034 - Page 3 of 5
1 of the court shall be released to the property owner, or designee, upon the court’s determination of
2 compliance by the property owner with the applicable risk reduction standard and state lead
3 poisoning prevention laws or upon a finding that the release of the money to the owner is necessary
4 to effectuate any repairs or improvements needed to the property to bring it into compliance with
5 the lead laws, and/or to repair any lead hazard(s).
6 (d) Notwithstanding subsection (c), the court shall may release money from the registry of
7 the court to the tenant, or designee, if the tenant has incurred costs to comply with the applicable
8 risk reduction standard and state lead poisoning prevention laws on presentation of a bill of the
9 reasonable costs of complying with the applicable risk reduction standard or other state lead
10 poisoning prevention laws. Provided, however that, a tenant has provided adequate written notice
11 of its intent to conduct any repairs or remediation to the landlord, and the landlord has willfully
12 failed to take corrective action or failed to respond within a reasonable timeframe. Any money to
13 be released under this subsection shall be subtracted from the money to be released under
14 subsection (c).
15 (e) Retaliatory actions prohibited. A lessee may not be evicted, the tenancy may not be
16 terminated, the rent may not be raised, or any services reduced, because a lessee in good faith elects
17 to seek the remedies under this section.
18 SECTION 2. This act shall take effect upon passage.
