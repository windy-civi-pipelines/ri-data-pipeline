6 This act shall be known and may be cited as the “Higher Education Opportunities for
7 Students with Intellectual Disabilities Act.”
8 16-24.2-2. Purpose.
9 The purpose of this chapter is to provide inclusive educational opportunities for a child or
10 student with a disability as referenced in § 16-24-1, to improve academic achievement, develop
11 employment and independent living skills and enhance the overall and independent learning
12 environments for these persons. More generally, the purpose of this chapter is to offer a further

4 to, severe intellectual disabilities, severe autism spectrum disorders or other severe developmental
5 disabilities and are receiving special education services may also have program options including,
6 but not limited to, continuing education, participation in credit and noncredit courses that include
7 students without disabilities in an institution of higher education, development of independent
8 living skills, development of skills necessary for employment and development of skills to access
9 community services. Participation of such students in institutions of higher education under this
10 section shall be considered an approved expense as a special education service and shall be a benefit
11 available to them pursuant to the provisions of § 16-24-1. More specifically, the provision of this
12 chapter shall be considered a form of secondary school education; provided, however, that this

14 program pursuant § 16-24-1.

7 autism spectrum disorders or developmental disability.
8 (2) Public institutions of higher education, in consultation with the department of
9 elementary and secondary education and the office of the postsecondary commissioner, and

20 course enrollment or audit preference for students with severe intellectual disabilities, severe autism
21 spectrum disorders or other severe developmental disabilities, relative to other persons seeking to

14 have the option to return to the student’s public high school, if it is found that taking courses at a
15 state college or university is not in the best interest of the student. If a student commences to attend
16 a state college or university pursuant to this chapter and subsequently returns to the high school
