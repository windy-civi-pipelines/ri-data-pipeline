18 appointment fails or refuses to submit a list, within thirty (30) days of notice of a vacancy, the

3 a municipal election office and would require the mayor or council president to make a nomination
4 for a replacement to the council within thirty (30) days of receipt of the lists. It would also clarify
5 the term expiration dates for canvassing authority members and alternates, and would direct the
6 city or town clerk to make immediate corrections if the term expiration dates on record are found
7 to be in noncompliance with the provisions of this act. The act would require the local canvassing
8 board to designate a chief local election official, and for that designee to designate an alternate local
9 election official. It would further establish that the chief local election official is the only agent
10 authorized to request user access to the statewide central voter register via the secretary of state.
