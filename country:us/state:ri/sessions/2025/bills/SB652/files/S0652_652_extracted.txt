A N A C T
RELATING TO HEALTH AND SAFETY -- REFUSE DISPOSAL
Introduced By: Senators Rogers, and de la Cruz
Date Introduced: March 07, 2025
Referred To: Senate Environment & Agriculture
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Legislative Findings.
2 The general assembly finds and declares that:
4 resources;
5 (2) The life of Rhode Island resource recovery's central landfill is not expected to exceed
6 2038, with limited ability to expand and/or relocate;
7 (3) Rhode Island has embarked innovative solutions to tackle its environmental challenges,
8 including "Let's Recycle Right." In 2021 CNBC ranked Rhode Island 46th in its annual "Top States
9 for Business." Innovative solutions are ready to put Rhode Island closer to the top of the list;
10 (4) Economic recovery in Rhode Island, post COVID is important to the well-being of all
11 Rhode Islanders;
12 (5) Rhode Island is committed to a clean environment and protection of its natural
13 resources. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has recognized that reusing and recycling
14 materials conserves natural resources, reduces waste, prevents pollution, reduces greenhouse
15 gasses contributing to climate change and serves as an important economic driver, helping to create
16 jobs and tax revenue; and
17 (6) The purpose of this chapter is to facilitate globally recognized state of the art
18 technologies in Rhode Island as they relate to clean, post-consumer recycled plastic. Rhode Island
19 stands to be the leader in New England joining over fifteen (15) states who have adopted this
1 legislation. Rhode Island has the potential to be nationally and internationally recognized as a state
2 that is encouraging innovation, by looking to the future in solving its environmental challenges.

IN GENERAL ASSEMBLY
JANUARY SESSION, A.D. 2025
____________
A N A C T
RELATING TO HEALTH AND SAFETY -- REFUSE DISPOSAL
Introduced By: Senators Rogers, and de la Cruz
Date Introduced: March 07, 2025
Referred To: Senate Environment & Agriculture
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Legislative Findings.
2 The general assembly finds and declares that:
3 (1) Rhode Island is committed to a clean environment and protection of its natural
4 resources;
5 (2) The life of Rhode Island resource recovery's central landfill is not expected to exceed
6 2038, with limited ability to expand and/or relocate;
7 (3) Rhode Island has embarked innovative solutions to tackle its environmental challenges,
8 including "Let's Recycle Right." In 2021 CNBC ranked Rhode Island 46th in its annual "Top States
9 for Business." Innovative solutions are ready to put Rhode Island closer to the top of the list;
10 (4) Economic recovery in Rhode Island, post COVID is important to the well-being of all
11 Rhode Islanders;
12 (5) Rhode Island is committed to a clean environment and protection of its natural
13 resources. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has recognized that reusing and recycling
14 materials conserves natural resources, reduces waste, prevents pollution, reduces greenhouse
15 gasses contributing to climate change and serves as an important economic driver, helping to create
16 jobs and tax revenue; and
17 (6) The purpose of this chapter is to facilitate globally recognized state of the art
18 technologies in Rhode Island as they relate to clean, post-consumer recycled plastic. Rhode Island
19 stands to be the leader in New England joining over fifteen (15) states who have adopted this

1 legislation. Rhode Island has the potential to be nationally and internationally recognized as a state
2 that is encouraging innovation, by looking to the future in solving its environmental challenges.
3 SECTION 2. Section 23-18.9-7 of the General Laws in Chapter 23-18.9 entitled "Refuse
4 Disposal" is hereby amended to read as follows:
5 23-18.9-7. Definitions.
6 As used in this chapter, the following terms shall, where the context permits, be construed
7 as follows:
8 (1) "Advanced recycling" means a manufacturing process for the conversion of post-use
9 polymers and recovered feedstock into basic hydrocarbon raw materials, feedstocks, chemicals,
10 and other products like waxes and lubricants through thermochemical processes that convert
11 plastics into their basic molecular components. The recycled products produced at advanced
12 recycling facilities include, but are not limited to, recycled plastics, monomers, oligomers, plastics,
13 plastics and chemical feedstocks, basic and unfinished chemicals, waxes, lubricants, and coatings.
14 Advanced recycling shall not be considered resource recovery, materials recovery, treatment,
15 utilization, conversion, waste processing, reconstituting, waste management, incineration,
16 combustion, or disposal.
17 (2) "Advanced recycling facility" means a facility that receives, stores and converts post-
18 use polymers and recovered feedstocks it receives using advanced recycling. An advanced
19 recycling facility is a manufacturing facility subject to applicable department manufacturing
20 regulations for air, water, waste, and land use. Advanced recycling facilities shall not include solid
21 waste management facilities, waste processing facilities, resource recovery facilities, materials
22 recovery facilities, intermediate processing facilities, or incinerators.

27 welfare, or the environment or creating potential nuisance conditions.
28 (2)(4) “Beneficial use determination” (BUD) means the case-by-case process by which the
29 director evaluates a proposal to use a specific solid waste as a beneficial reuse material for a specific
30 purpose at a specific location within the host municipality.

18 (5)(7) “Construction and demolition debris processing facility” means a solid waste
19 management facility that receives and processes construction and demolition debris. These
20 facilities must demonstrate, through records maintained at the facility and provided to the
21 department, that seventy-five percent (75%) of all material received by the facility is processed and
22 removed from the site within six (6) weeks of receipt on a continuous basis, and that in no case

1 This act would provide a definition for "advanced recycling" and "advanced recycling
2 facility" which would mean a facility and recycling process that receives, stores and converts post-
3 use polymers and recovered feedstocks it receives using advanced recycling and would establish a
4 plastics recycling mandate for certain businesses.
5 This act would take effect upon passage.
