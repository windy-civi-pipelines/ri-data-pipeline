Referred To: Recommended for Immediate Consideration
1 WHEREAS, Over an estimated one million Americans are currently living with brain
2 tumors; and around 90,000 people are diagnosed with a primary brain tumor every year; and
3 WHEREAS, Approximately 24,820 people will receive a malignant brain tumor cancer
4 diagnosis in 2025, and an estimated 18,330 people will die; and
5 WHEREAS, The relative survival rate in the United States for all people following
6 diagnosis of a malignant brain tumor is only 35.7 percent, with the deadliest and most common
7 form of brain cancer, Glioblastoma, having an average survival rate of only 7.1 percent and
8 median survival rate of only 9 months; and
9 WHEREAS, The treatment of brain tumors presents significant challenges because of the
10 brain's uniquely complex and fragile nature; and
11 WHEREAS, Brain tumors can have lasting and life-altering physical, cognitive, and
12 psychological impacts on a person's life; and
13 WHEREAS, Brain tumors affect the primary organ in the human body that controls not
14 only cognitive ability, but the actions of every other limb and organ in the body, leading to brain
15 tumors being described as a disease that affects the whole individual; and
16 WHEREAS, Daunting obstacles remain to the development of new treatments, and no
17 strategies for the screening or early detection of brain tumors exist currently; and
18 WHEREAS, A need for greater public awareness of brain tumors exists, including
19 awareness of the difficulties associated with research on brain tumors and the opportunities for

1 advances in research and treatment; now, therefore be it
2 RESOLVED, That this Senate of the State of Rhode Island hereby recognizes the
3 importance of awareness and the urgent need for further research into brain tumors and hereby
4 declares May of 2025, to be "Brain Tumor Awareness Month" in the State of Rhode Island; and

6 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
7 transmit duly certified copies of this resolution to Mr. Bob Kruchten, Chair, and Ms. Kelly Sitkin,
