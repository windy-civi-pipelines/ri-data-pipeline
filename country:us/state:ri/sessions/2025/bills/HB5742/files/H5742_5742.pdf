RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FEDERAL AID
***
1 This act would establish a statewide “Healthy School Meals for all” universal school
2 breakfast and lunch program in Rhode Island public schools phased in over 3 years. The program
3 would begin with all elementary school students, then add all middle school students in year two
4 (2), and then provide universal meals for all students by the 2027-2028 school year. The act would
5 also direct that in operating its school breakfast and lunch program, each public educational entity
6 would seek to maximize access to federal funds for the cost of the school breakfast and lunch
7 program by participating in one of several identified federal programs in order to obtain federal
8 funds to offset the costs to districts of providing free breakfasts and lunches and minimize the costs
9 to the state.
10 This act would take effect on July 1, 2026.
