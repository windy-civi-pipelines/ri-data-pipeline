A N A C T
GROWTH BLOCKCHAIN ACT
Introduced By: Representatives Place, Hopkins, and Nardone
Date Introduced: February 26, 2025
Referred To: House Corporations
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Legislative findings.
2 The general assembly finds and declares:
3 (1) It is declared to be the policy of the state to promote a vigorous and growing economy,
4 to prevent economic stagnation, and to encourage the creation of new job opportunities in order to
5 ameliorate the hazards of unemployment and underemployment, reduce the level of public
6 assistance, increase revenues to the state and its municipalities, and to achieve a stable diversified
7 economy.
8 (2) The State of Rhode Island understands that to compete in the twenty-first century
9 economy, Rhode Island must offer one of the best business environments in the United States for
10 blockchain and technology innovators, and should offer a comprehensive regulatory technology
11 sandbox for these innovators to develop the next generation of digital products and services in
12 Rhode Island.
13 (3) Building a more robust public-private partnership framework is mandatory for
14 economic success.
15 (4) The State of Rhode Island understands that further developing technology industries
16 within a robust public-private partnership brings better efficiency, trust, and accountability between
17 Rhode Island state government, businesses, and residents.
18 (5) The state understands a public-private partnership developing an immutable
1 interagency-industry-operability blockchain filing system is vital and redevelopment investment in
2 opportunity zones that shall install, maintain, and organize within the system of blockchain records
3 throughout the state is advantageous.
4 (6) Financial and health technology is undergoing a transformational period in which new
5 technologies are providing greater automation, connectivity and transparency for provenance of
6 products and services:
7 (i) Existing legal frameworks are restricting technology innovation because these
8 frameworks were largely established at a time when technology was not a fundamental component
9 of products and services;
10 (ii) Technology innovators require a supervised, flexible regulatory sandbox to test new
11 products and services using waivers of specified statutes and rules under defined conditions;
12 (iii) Jurisdictions which establish regulatory sandboxes are more likely to provide a
13 welcoming business environment for technology innovators and may experience significant
14 business growth;
15 (iv) Other jurisdictions have enacted, or are considering, regulatory sandboxes for financial
16 technology innovators in their jurisdictions;
17 (7)(i) The rapid innovation of blockchain technology including the growing use of virtual
18 currency and other digital assets has resulted in many blockchain innovators being unable to access
19 secure and reliable banking services thereby hampering development of blockchain services and
20 products in the marketplace;
21 (ii) Federally insured financial institutions are not generally permitted to manage accounts
22 in virtual currency or hold other digital assets;
23 (iii) Blockchain innovators have greater compliance challenges with federal customer
24 identification, anti-money laundering and beneficial ownership requirements because of the
25 complex nature of these obligations and the unfamiliarity of regulators with blockchain innovators'
26 businesses;
27 (iv) These intricate obligations have resulted in many financial institutions in Rhode Island
28 and across the United States refusing to provide banking services to blockchain innovators and also
29 refusing to accept deposits in United States currency obtained from the sale of virtual currency or
30 other digital assets;
31 (v) Compliance with applicable federal and state laws is critical to ensuring the future
32 growth and reputation of the blockchain and technology industries as a whole;
33 (vi) Most financial institutions today do not have the requisite expertise or familiarity with
34 the challenges facing blockchain innovators which is required to provide secure and reliable
LC001803 - Page 2 of 29
1 banking services to these innovators;
2 (vii) A new type of Rhode Island financial payments and depository institution that has
3 expertise with customer identification, anti-money laundering and beneficial ownership
4 requirements could seamlessly integrate these requirements into its operating model; and
5 (viii) Authorizing special purpose depository institutions to be chartered in Rhode Island
6 will provide a necessary and valuable service to blockchain innovators, emphasize Rhode Island's
7 partnership with the technology and financial industry and safely grow this state's developing
8 financial sector.

LC001803 - Page 24 of 29
1 within the time prescribed under chapter 4 of title 19 or an order of the commissioner, the
2 commissioner shall conduct a liquidation or appoint a conservator pursuant to chapters 11 or 12 of
3 title 19;
4 (2) As used in this section:
5 (i) "Failed" or "failure" means, consistent with rules adopted by the commissioner, a
6 circumstance when a special purpose depository institution has not:
7 (A) Complied with the requirements of this chapter;
8 (B) Maintained a contingency account, as required by this section; or
9 (C) Paid, in the manner commonly accepted by business practices, its legal obligations to
10 depositors on demand or to discharge any certificates of deposit, promissory notes or other
11 indebtedness when due.
12 (ii) "Unsafe or unsound condition" means, consistent with rules adopted by the
13 commissioner, a circumstance relating to a special purpose depository institution which is likely
14 to:
15 (A) Cause the failure of the institution as defined in this subsection;
16 (B) Cause a substantial dissipation of assets or earnings:
17 (C) Substantially disrupt the services provided by the institution to depositors; or
18 (D) Otherwise substantially prejudice the depository interests of depositors.
19 (gg)(1) A special purpose depository institution may voluntarily dissolve in accordance
20 with the provisions of this section. Voluntary dissolution shall be accomplished by either
21 liquidating the special purpose depository institution or reorganizing the institution into an
22 appropriate business entity that does not engage in any activity authorized only for a special purpose
23 depository institution. Upon complete liquidation or completion of the reorganization, the
24 commissioner shall revoke the charter of the special purpose depository institution and afterward,
25 the company shall not use the word "special purpose depository institution" or "bank" in its business
26 name or in connection with its ongoing business.
27 (2) The special purpose depository institution may dissolve its charter either by liquidation
28 or reorganization. The board of directors shall file an application for dissolution with the
29 commissioner, accompanied by a filing fee established by rule of the commissioner. The
30 application shall include a comprehensive plan for dissolution setting forth the proposed disposition
31 of all assets and liabilities, in reasonable detail to effect a liquidation or reorganization, and any
32 other plans required by the commissioner. The plan of dissolution shall provide for the discharge
33 or assumption of all of the known and unknown claims and liabilities of the special purpose
34 depository institution. Additionally, the application for dissolution shall include other evidence,
LC001803 - Page 25 of 29
1 certifications, affidavits, documents or information as the commissioner may require, including a
2 demonstration of how assets and liabilities will be disposed, the timetable for effecting disposition
3 of the assets and liabilities and a proposal of the special purpose depository institution for
4 addressing any claims that are asserted after dissolution has been completed. The commissioner
5 shall examine the application for compliance with this section, the business entity laws applicable
6 to the required type of dissolution and applicable rules. The commissioner may conduct a special
7 examination of the special purpose depository institution consistent with chapter 4 of title 19 and
8 the guidelines set forth in this chapter for purposes of evaluating the application.
9 (3) If the commissioner finds that the application is incomplete, the commissioner shall
10 return it for completion not later than sixty (60) days after it is filed. If the application is found to
11 be complete by the commissioner, the commissioner shall approve or disapprove the application
12 not later than thirty (30) days after it is filed. If the commissioner approves the application the
13 special purpose depository institution may proceed with the dissolution pursuant to the plan
14 outlined in the application subject to any further conditions the commissioner may prescribe. If the
15 special purpose depository institution subsequently determines that the plan of dissolution needs to
16 be amended to complete the dissolution, it shall file an amended plan with the commissioner and
17 obtain approval to proceed under the amended plan. If the commissioner does not approve the
18 application or amended plan, the special purpose depository institution may appeal the decision to
19 the board pursuant to chapter 35 of title 42 ("administrative procedures").
20 (4) Upon completion of all actions required under the plan of dissolution and satisfaction
21 of all conditions prescribed by the commissioner, the special purpose depository institution shall
22 submit a written report of its actions to the commissioner. The report shall contain a certification
23 made under oath that the report is true and correct. Following receipt of the report, the
24 commissioner, no later than sixty (60) days after the filing of the report, shall examine the special
25 purpose depository institution to determine whether the commissioner is satisfied that all required
26 actions have been taken in accordance with the plan of dissolution and any conditions prescribed
27 by the commissioner. If all requirements and conditions have been met, the commissioner shall,
28 within thirty (30) days of the examination, notify the special purpose depository institution in
29 writing that the dissolution has been completed and issue a certificate of dissolution.
30 (5) Upon receiving a certificate of dissolution, the special purpose depository institution
31 shall surrender its charter to the commissioner. The special purpose depository institution shall then
32 file articles of dissolution and other documents required by § 7-1.2-1309. In the case of
33 reorganization, the special purpose depository institution shall file the documents required by the
34 secretary of state to finalize the reorganization.
LC001803 - Page 26 of 29
1 (6) If the commissioner determines that all required actions under the plan for dissolution,
2 or as otherwise required by the commissioner, have not been completed the commissioner shall
3 notify the special purpose depository institution not later than thirty (30) days after this
4 determination, in writing what additional actions shall be taken in order for the institution to be
5 eligible for a certificate of dissolution. The commissioner shall establish a reasonable deadline for
6 the submission of evidence that additional actions have been taken and the commissioner may
7 extend any deadline upon good cause. If the special purpose depository institution fails to file a
8 supplemental report showing that the additional actions have been taken before the deadline, or
9 submits a report that is found not to be satisfactory by the commissioner, the commissioner shall
10 notify the special purpose depository institution in writing that its voluntary dissolution is not
11 approved, and the institution may appeal the decision to the board pursuant to chapter 35 of title 42
12 ("administrative procedures").
13 (hh) If a special purpose depository institution fails to submit any report required by this
14 chapter or by rule within the prescribed period, the commissioner may impose and collect a fee of
15 up to one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each day the report is overdue, as established by rule.
16 (ii) Each officer, director, employee or agent of a special purpose depository institution,
17 following written notice from the commissioner is subject to removal upon order of the
18 commissioner if they knowingly or willfully fail to perform any duty required by this chapter or
19 other applicable law or conform to any rule or order of the commissioner.
20 42-64.35-6. Severability in a pari material construction with other chapters.
21 (a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, if any provision of this chapter or
22 the application of this chapter to any person or circumstances is held invalid or unconstitutional,
23 the invalidity or unconstitutionality shall not affect other provisions or applications of this chapter
24 that can be given effect without the invalid or unconstitutional provision or application, and to this
25 end the provisions of this chapter are declared to be severable.
26 (b) The provisions of this chapter 64.35 of title 42 ("this chapter") shall be interpreted to
27 be in pari material with, consistent with, and harmonized with the provisions of chapter 56 of title
28 6 ("uniform supplemental commercial law for the uniform regulation of virtual-currency businesses
29 act"), chapter 14 of title 19 ("licensed activities"), and chapter 14.3 of title 19 ("currency
30 transmissions"). To the extent any provision of this chapter 64.35 of title 42 is determined to be
31 inconsistent with and cannot be harmonized with the provisions of any of the aforesaid chapters,
32 the provisions of chapter 56 of title 6, chapter 14 of title 19, and chapter 14.3 of title 19 shall control
33 and prevail over the provisions of this chapter.

IN GENERAL ASSEMBLY
JANUARY SESSION, A.D. 2025
____________
A N A C T
RELATING TO STATE AFFAIRS AND GOVERNMENT -- RHODE ISLAND ECONOMIC
GROWTH BLOCKCHAIN ACT
Introduced By: Representatives Place, Hopkins, and Nardone
Date Introduced: February 26, 2025
Referred To: House Corporations
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Legislative findings.
2 The general assembly finds and declares:
3 (1) It is declared to be the policy of the state to promote a vigorous and growing economy,
4 to prevent economic stagnation, and to encourage the creation of new job opportunities in order to
5 ameliorate the hazards of unemployment and underemployment, reduce the level of public
6 assistance, increase revenues to the state and its municipalities, and to achieve a stable diversified
7 economy.
8 (2) The State of Rhode Island understands that to compete in the twenty-first century
9 economy, Rhode Island must offer one of the best business environments in the United States for
10 blockchain and technology innovators, and should offer a comprehensive regulatory technology
11 sandbox for these innovators to develop the next generation of digital products and services in
12 Rhode Island.
13 (3) Building a more robust public-private partnership framework is mandatory for
14 economic success.
15 (4) The State of Rhode Island understands that further developing technology industries
16 within a robust public-private partnership brings better efficiency, trust, and accountability between
17 Rhode Island state government, businesses, and residents.
18 (5) The state understands a public-private partnership developing an immutable

1 interagency-industry-operability blockchain filing system is vital and redevelopment investment in
2 opportunity zones that shall install, maintain, and organize within the system of blockchain records
3 throughout the state is advantageous.
4 (6) Financial and health technology is undergoing a transformational period in which new
5 technologies are providing greater automation, connectivity and transparency for provenance of
6 products and services:
7 (i) Existing legal frameworks are restricting technology innovation because these
8 frameworks were largely established at a time when technology was not a fundamental component
9 of products and services;
10 (ii) Technology innovators require a supervised, flexible regulatory sandbox to test new
11 products and services using waivers of specified statutes and rules under defined conditions;
12 (iii) Jurisdictions which establish regulatory sandboxes are more likely to provide a
13 welcoming business environment for technology innovators and may experience significant
14 business growth;
15 (iv) Other jurisdictions have enacted, or are considering, regulatory sandboxes for financial
16 technology innovators in their jurisdictions;
17 (7)(i) The rapid innovation of blockchain technology including the growing use of virtual
18 currency and other digital assets has resulted in many blockchain innovators being unable to access
19 secure and reliable banking services thereby hampering development of blockchain services and
20 products in the marketplace;
21 (ii) Federally insured financial institutions are not generally permitted to manage accounts
22 in virtual currency or hold other digital assets;
23 (iii) Blockchain innovators have greater compliance challenges with federal customer
24 identification, anti-money laundering and beneficial ownership requirements because of the
25 complex nature of these obligations and the unfamiliarity of regulators with blockchain innovators'
26 businesses;
27 (iv) These intricate obligations have resulted in many financial institutions in Rhode Island
28 and across the United States refusing to provide banking services to blockchain innovators and also
29 refusing to accept deposits in United States currency obtained from the sale of virtual currency or
30 other digital assets;
31 (v) Compliance with applicable federal and state laws is critical to ensuring the future
32 growth and reputation of the blockchain and technology industries as a whole;
33 (vi) Most financial institutions today do not have the requisite expertise or familiarity with
34 the challenges facing blockchain innovators which is required to provide secure and reliable
LC001803 - Page 2 of 29

1 banking services to these innovators;
2 (vii) A new type of Rhode Island financial payments and depository institution that has
3 expertise with customer identification, anti-money laundering and beneficial ownership
4 requirements could seamlessly integrate these requirements into its operating model; and
5 (viii) Authorizing special purpose depository institutions to be chartered in Rhode Island
6 will provide a necessary and valuable service to blockchain innovators, emphasize Rhode Island's
7 partnership with the technology and financial industry and safely grow this state's developing
8 financial sector.

1 hearsay.
2 (y)(1) Within ninety (90) days after receipt of the transcript of the public hearing, the board
3 shall render a decision on the charter application based solely on the following criteria:
4 (i) Whether the character, reputation, financial standing and ability of the incorporators is
5 sufficient to afford reasonable promise of a successful operation;
6 (ii) Whether the character, financial responsibility, banking or other financial experience

16 confusion; and
17 (vii) Whether the applicants have complied with all applicable provisions of state law.
18 (2) The board shall approve an application upon making favorable findings on the criteria
19 set forth in this section. If necessary, the board may either conditionally approve an application by
20 specifying conditions relating to the criteria or may disapprove the application. The board shall
21 state findings of fact and conclusions of law as part of its decision. If the board approves the
22 application, the commissioner shall endorse upon the articles of incorporation the approval of the
23 board and shall transmit one copy to the secretary of state, retain one copy and return a copy to the
24 applicants within twenty (20) days after the date of the decision of the board approving the
25 application. If the board conditionally approves an application and upon compliance with necessary
26 conditions required by the board, the commissioner shall proceed as provided in the preceding
27 sentence. If the board disapproves the application, the commissioner shall mail notice of the
28 disapproval to the applicants within twenty (20) days of the board's disapproval.
29 (z)(1) If an application is approved and a charter granted by the board, the special purpose
30 depository institution shall not commence business before receiving a certificate of authority to
31 operate from the commissioner. The application for a certificate of authority shall be made to the
32 commissioner and shall certify the address at which the special purpose depository institution will
33 operate and that all adopted bylaws of the institution have been attached as an exhibit to the
34 application. The application shall state the identities and contact information of officers and
LC001803 - Page 21 of 29

1 directors. The commissioner shall approve or deny an application for a certificate of authority to
2 operate within thirty (30) days after a complete application has been filed. The authority of the
3 commissioner to disapprove any application shall be restricted solely to noncompliance with this
4 section; provided that, if the commissioner approves the application, the commissioner shall issue
5 a certificate of authority to the applicants within twenty (20) days. If the commissioner denies the
6 application, the commissioner shall mail a notice of denial to the applicants within twenty (20)
7 days, stating the reasons for denying the application, and grant to the applicants a period of ninety
8 (90) days to resubmit the application with the necessary corrections. If the applicants fail to comply
9 with requirements of the notice of denial within ninety (90) days from the receipt of the notice, the
10 charter of the special purpose depository institution shall be revoked by the commissioner. The
11 failure of the commissioner to act upon an application for a certificate of authority within thirty
12 (30) days shall be deemed an approval
13 (2) If an approved special purpose depository institution fails to commence business in
14 good faith within six (6) months after the issuance of a certificate of authority to operate by the
15 commissioner, the charter and certificate of authority shall expire. The board, for good cause and
16 upon an application filed prior to the expiration of the six (6) month period, may extend the time
17 within which the special purpose depository institution may open for business.
18 (aa) Any decision of the board or commissioner in approving, conditionally approving or
19 disapproving a charter for a special purpose depository institution or the issuance or denial of a
20 certificate of authority to operate is appealable to the district court of the county in which the
21 institution is to be located, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 35 of title 42
22 ("administrative procedures"). In addition to the grounds for appeal contained in chapter 35 of title
23 42 ("administrative procedures"), an appellant may appeal if the board or the commissioner fails to
24 make any of the required findings or otherwise take an action required by law.
25 (bb)(1) Except as otherwise provided by this section, a special purpose depository
26 institution shall, before transacting any business, pledge or furnish a surety bond to the
27 commissioner to cover costs likely to be incurred by the commissioner in a liquidation or
28 conservatorship of the special purpose depository institution. The amount of the surety bond or
29 pledge of assets under this section shall be determined by the commissioner in an amount sufficient
30 to defray the costs of a liquidation or conservatorship.
31 (2) In lieu of a bond, a special purpose depository institution may irrevocably pledge
32 specified capital equivalent to a bond to satisfy this subsection. Any capital pledged to the
33 commissioner under this subsection shall be held in a state or nationally chartered bank or savings
34 and loan association having a principal or branch office in this state. All costs associated with
LC001803 - Page 22 of 29

1 pledging and holding such capital are the responsibility of the special purpose depository
2 institution.
3 (3) Capital pledged to the commissioner shall be of the same nature and quality as those
4 required for state financial institutions under title 19.
5 (4) Surety bonds shall run to the State of Rhode Island, and shall be approved under the
6 terms and conditions established by the commissioner pursuant to the commissioner's authority
7 under title 19.
8 (5) The commissioner may adopt rules to establish additional investment guidelines or
9 investment options for purposes of the pledge or surety bond required by this subsection.
10 (6) In the event of a liquidation or conservatorship of a special purpose depository
11 institution pursuant to chapters 10, 11 or 12 of title 19, the commissioner may, without regard to
12 priorities, preferences or adverse claims, reduce the surety bond or capital pledged under this
13 section to cash as soon as practicable and utilize the cash to defray the costs associated with the
14 liquidation or conservatorship.
15 (7) Income from capital pledged under this subsection shall be paid to the special purpose
16 depository institution, unless a liquidation or conservatorship takes place.
17 (8) Upon evidence that the current surety bond or pledged capital is insufficient, the
18 commissioner may require a special purpose depository institution to increase its surety bond or
19 pledged capital by providing not less than thirty (30) days' written notice to the institution. The
20 special purpose depository institution may request a hearing before the board not more than thirty
21 (30) days after receiving written notice from the commissioner under this subsection. Any hearing
22 before the board shall be held pursuant to chapter 35 of title 42 ("administrative procedures").
23 (cc)(1) The commissioner may call for reports verified under oath from a special purpose
24 depository institution at any time as necessary to inform the commissioner of the condition of the
25 institution.
26 (2) All reports required of special purpose depository institutions by the commissioner and
27 all materials relating to examinations of these institutions shall be subject to the provisions of
28 chapter 4 of title 19.
29 (3) Every special purpose depository institution is subject to the examination of the
30 commissioner. The commissioner or a duly appointed examiner shall visit and examine special
31 purpose depository institutions on a schedule established by rule. The commissioner or a duly
32 appointed examiner shall make a complete and careful examination of the condition and resources
33 of a special purpose depository institution, the mode of managing institution affairs and conducting
34 business, the actions of officers and directors in the investment and disposition of funds, the safety
LC001803 - Page 23 of 29

1 and prudence of institution management, compliance with the requirements of this chapter and such
2 other matters as the commissioner may require. After an examination, the special purpose
3 depository institution shall remit to the commissioner an amount equal to the total cost of the
4 examination. This amount shall be remitted to the state treasurer and deposited into the special
5 purpose depository institutions subaccount established under this chapter.
6 (4) On or before January 31 and July 31 of each year, a special purpose depository
7 institution shall compute and pay supervisory fees to the commissioner based on the total assets of
8 the special purpose depository institution as of the preceding December 31 and June 30,
9 respectively. Supervisory fees under this section shall provide for the operating costs of the office
10 of the commissioner and the administration of the laws governing special purpose depository
11 institutions. Such fees shall be established by rule of the commissioner and shall be adjusted by the
12 commissioner to ensure consistency with the cost of supervision. Supervisory fees shall be
13 deposited by the commissioner with the state treasurer and credited to the special purpose
14 depository institutions subaccount established under this chapter
15 (5) A special purpose depository institution shall maintain appropriate insurance or a bond
16 covering the operational risks of the institution, which shall include coverage for directors' and
17 officers' liability, errors and omissions liability and information technology infrastructure and

21 that:
22 (i) The special purpose depository institution has failed or refused to comply with an order
23 issued by the commissioner or other regulatory body;
24 (ii) The application for a charter contained a false statement or material misrepresentation
25 or material omission; or
26 (iii) An officer, director or agent of the special purpose depository institution, in connection
27 with an application for a charter, examination, report or other document filed with the
28 commissioner, knowingly made a false statement, material misrepresentation or material omission
29 to the board, the commissioner or the duly authorized agent of the board or commissioner.
30 (ee) If the charter of a special purpose depository institution is surrendered, suspended or
31 revoked, the institution shall continue to be subject to the provisions of this chapter during any
32 liquidation or conservatorship.
33 (ff)(1) If the commissioner finds that a special purpose depository institution has failed or
34 is operating in an unsafe or unsound condition, as defined in this section, that has not been remedied
LC001803 - Page 24 of 29

1 within the time prescribed under chapter 4 of title 19 or an order of the commissioner, the
2 commissioner shall conduct a liquidation or appoint a conservator pursuant to chapters 11 or 12 of
3 title 19;
4 (2) As used in this section:
5 (i) "Failed" or "failure" means, consistent with rules adopted by the commissioner, a
6 circumstance when a special purpose depository institution has not:
7 (A) Complied with the requirements of this chapter;
8 (B) Maintained a contingency account, as required by this section; or
9 (C) Paid, in the manner commonly accepted by business practices, its legal obligations to

14 to:
15 (A) Cause the failure of the institution as defined in this subsection;
16 (B) Cause a substantial dissipation of assets or earnings:
17 (C) Substantially disrupt the services provided by the institution to depositors; or
18 (D) Otherwise substantially prejudice the depository interests of depositors.
19 (gg)(1) A special purpose depository institution may voluntarily dissolve in accordance
20 with the provisions of this section. Voluntary dissolution shall be accomplished by either
21 liquidating the special purpose depository institution or reorganizing the institution into an
22 appropriate business entity that does not engage in any activity authorized only for a special purpose
23 depository institution. Upon complete liquidation or completion of the reorganization, the
24 commissioner shall revoke the charter of the special purpose depository institution and afterward,
25 the company shall not use the word "special purpose depository institution" or "bank" in its business
26 name or in connection with its ongoing business.
27 (2) The special purpose depository institution may dissolve its charter either by liquidation
28 or reorganization. The board of directors shall file an application for dissolution with the
29 commissioner, accompanied by a filing fee established by rule of the commissioner. The
30 application shall include a comprehensive plan for dissolution setting forth the proposed disposition
31 of all assets and liabilities, in reasonable detail to effect a liquidation or reorganization, and any
32 other plans required by the commissioner. The plan of dissolution shall provide for the discharge
33 or assumption of all of the known and unknown claims and liabilities of the special purpose
34 depository institution. Additionally, the application for dissolution shall include other evidence,
LC001803 - Page 25 of 29

1 certifications, affidavits, documents or information as the commissioner may require, including a
2 demonstration of how assets and liabilities will be disposed, the timetable for effecting disposition
3 of the assets and liabilities and a proposal of the special purpose depository institution for
4 addressing any claims that are asserted after dissolution has been completed. The commissioner
5 shall examine the application for compliance with this section, the business entity laws applicable
6 to the required type of dissolution and applicable rules. The commissioner may conduct a special
7 examination of the special purpose depository institution consistent with chapter 4 of title 19 and
8 the guidelines set forth in this chapter for purposes of evaluating the application.
9 (3) If the commissioner finds that the application is incomplete, the commissioner shall
10 return it for completion not later than sixty (60) days after it is filed. If the application is found to
11 be complete by the commissioner, the commissioner shall approve or disapprove the application
12 not later than thirty (30) days after it is filed. If the commissioner approves the application the
13 special purpose depository institution may proceed with the dissolution pursuant to the plan
14 outlined in the application subject to any further conditions the commissioner may prescribe. If the
15 special purpose depository institution subsequently determines that the plan of dissolution needs to
16 be amended to complete the dissolution, it shall file an amended plan with the commissioner and
17 obtain approval to proceed under the amended plan. If the commissioner does not approve the
18 application or amended plan, the special purpose depository institution may appeal the decision to
19 the board pursuant to chapter 35 of title 42 ("administrative procedures").
20 (4) Upon completion of all actions required under the plan of dissolution and satisfaction
21 of all conditions prescribed by the commissioner, the special purpose depository institution shall
22 submit a written report of its actions to the commissioner. The report shall contain a certification
23 made under oath that the report is true and correct. Following receipt of the report, the
24 commissioner, no later than sixty (60) days after the filing of the report, shall examine the special
25 purpose depository institution to determine whether the commissioner is satisfied that all required
26 actions have been taken in accordance with the plan of dissolution and any conditions prescribed
27 by the commissioner. If all requirements and conditions have been met, the commissioner shall,
28 within thirty (30) days of the examination, notify the special purpose depository institution in
29 writing that the dissolution has been completed and issue a certificate of dissolution.
30 (5) Upon receiving a certificate of dissolution, the special purpose depository institution
31 shall surrender its charter to the commissioner. The special purpose depository institution shall then
32 file articles of dissolution and other documents required by § 7-1.2-1309. In the case of
33 reorganization, the special purpose depository institution shall file the documents required by the
34 secretary of state to finalize the reorganization.
LC001803 - Page 26 of 29

1 (6) If the commissioner determines that all required actions under the plan for dissolution,
2 or as otherwise required by the commissioner, have not been completed the commissioner shall
3 notify the special purpose depository institution not later than thirty (30) days after this
4 determination, in writing what additional actions shall be taken in order for the institution to be
5 eligible for a certificate of dissolution. The commissioner shall establish a reasonable deadline for
6 the submission of evidence that additional actions have been taken and the commissioner may
7 extend any deadline upon good cause. If the special purpose depository institution fails to file a
8 supplemental report showing that the additional actions have been taken before the deadline, or
9 submits a report that is found not to be satisfactory by the commissioner, the commissioner shall
10 notify the special purpose depository institution in writing that its voluntary dissolution is not
11 approved, and the institution may appeal the decision to the board pursuant to chapter 35 of title 42
12 ("administrative procedures").
13 (hh) If a special purpose depository institution fails to submit any report required by this
14 chapter or by rule within the prescribed period, the commissioner may impose and collect a fee of
15 up to one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each day the report is overdue, as established by rule.
16 (ii) Each officer, director, employee or agent of a special purpose depository institution,
17 following written notice from the commissioner is subject to removal upon order of the
18 commissioner if they knowingly or willfully fail to perform any duty required by this chapter or
19 other applicable law or conform to any rule or order of the commissioner.
20 42-64.35-6. Severability in a pari material construction with other chapters.
21 (a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, if any provision of this chapter or
22 the application of this chapter to any person or circumstances is held invalid or unconstitutional,
23 the invalidity or unconstitutionality shall not affect other provisions or applications of this chapter
24 that can be given effect without the invalid or unconstitutional provision or application, and to this
25 end the provisions of this chapter are declared to be severable.
26 (b) The provisions of this chapter 64.35 of title 42 ("this chapter") shall be interpreted to
27 be in pari material with, consistent with, and harmonized with the provisions of chapter 56 of title
28 6 ("uniform supplemental commercial law for the uniform regulation of virtual-currency businesses
29 act"), chapter 14 of title 19 ("licensed activities"), and chapter 14.3 of title 19 ("currency
30 transmissions"). To the extent any provision of this chapter 64.35 of title 42 is determined to be
31 inconsistent with and cannot be harmonized with the provisions of any of the aforesaid chapters,
32 the provisions of chapter 56 of title 6, chapter 14 of title 19, and chapter 14.3 of title 19 shall control
33 and prevail over the provisions of this chapter.
