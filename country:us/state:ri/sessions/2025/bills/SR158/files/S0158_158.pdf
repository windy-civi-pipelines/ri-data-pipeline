16 litigating energy rate cases before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; and
17 WHEREAS, William Harsch returned to Rhode Island permanently in the 1990s where

23 woman who was sued by a group of developers for speaking out against a landfill that posed a
24 threat to the Town’s drinking water supply; and
25 WHEREAS, Mr. Harsch’s extensive public service career also included serving on the
26 Board of the Quonset Development Corporation, and served as the Vice Chair of the Rhode
27 Island Ethics Commission. Mr. Harsch also ran twice for the office of Rhode Island Attorney
