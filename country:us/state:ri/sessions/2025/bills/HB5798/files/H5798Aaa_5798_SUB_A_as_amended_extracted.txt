2 45-24-37. General provisions — Permitted uses.
3 (a) The zoning ordinance shall provide a listing of all land uses and/or performance
4 standards for uses that are permitted within the zoning use districts of the municipality. The
5 ordinance may provide for a procedure under which a proposed land use that is not specifically
6 listed may be presented by the property owner to the zoning board of review or to a local official
7 or agency charged with administration and enforcement of the ordinance for an evaluation and
8 determination of whether the proposed use is of a similar type, character, and intensity as a listed
9 permitted use. Upon such determination, the proposed use may be considered to be a permitted use.
10 (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the following uses are permitted
11 uses within all residential zoning use districts of a municipality and all industrial and commercial
12 zoning use districts except where residential use is prohibited for public health or safety reasons:
13 (1) Households;
14 (2) Community residences; and
15 (3) Family daycare homes.

19 or homes, as the need may be, elsewhere upon the land, for use and occupancy of the former
20 occupants for a period of up to twelve (12) months, or until the building or structure is rehabilitated
21 and otherwise made fit for occupancy. The property owner, or a properly designated agent of the
22 owner, is only allowed to cause the mobile and manufactured home, or homes, to remain
23 temporarily upon the land by making timely application to the local building official for the
24 purposes of obtaining the necessary permits to repair or rebuild the structure.

26 disabilities to residential structures is allowed as a reasonable accommodation for any person(s)
27 residing, or intending to reside, in the residential structure.
28 (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, an accessory dwelling unit
29 (“ADU”) that meets the requirements of §§ 45-24-31 and 45-24-73(a) shall be a permitted use in

7 medical buildings, and malls into residential units or mixed-use developments which include the
8 development of at least fifty percent (50%) of the existing gross floor area into residential units,
9 shall be a permitted use and allowed by specific and objective provisions of a zoning ordinance,
10 except where such is prohibited by environmental land use restrictions recorded on the property by
11 the state of Rhode Island department of environmental management or the United States
12 Environmental Protection Agency preventing the conversion to residential use.
13 (1) The specific zoning ordinance provisions for adaptive reuse shall exempt adaptive reuse
14 developments from off-street parking requirements of over one space per dwelling unit.
15 (2) Density.
16 (i) For projects that meet the following criteria, zoning ordinances shall allow for high
17 density development and shall not limit the density to less than fifteen (15) dwelling units per acre:
18 (A) Where the project is limited to the existing footprint, except that the footprint is allowed

23 private water, such as a well and and/or wastewater treatment system(s) approved by the relevant
24 state agency for the entire development as applicable.
25 (ii) For all other adaptive reuse projects, the residential density permitted in the converted
26 structure shall be the maximum allowed that otherwise meets all standards of minimum housing
27 and has access to public sewer and water service or has access to adequate private water, such as a
28 well, and wastewater treatment system(s) approved by the relevant state agency for the entire
29 development, as applicable. The density proposed shall be determined to meet all public health and
30 safety standards.
31 (3) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, for adaptive reuse projects,
32 existing building setbacks shall remain and shall be considered legal nonconforming, but no
33 additional encroachments shall be permitted into any nonconforming setback, unless otherwise
34 allowed by zoning ordinance or relief is granted by the applicable authority.
LC002158/SUB A - Page 6 of 8
1 (4) For adaptive reuse projects, notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the
2 height of the existing structure, if it exceeds the maximum height of the zoning district, may remain
3 and shall be considered legal nonconforming, and any rooftop construction shall be included within
4 the height exemption.
5 (i) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, all towns and cities may allow
6 manufactured homes that comply with § 23-27.3-109.1.3 as a type of single-family home on any
7 lot zoned for single-family use. Such home shall comply with all dimensional requirements of a
8 single-family home in the district or seek relief for the same under the provisions of this chapter.
9 (j) Attached single family dwellings. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter,
10 all towns and cities shall allow attached single-family units, as defined in § 45-24-33, in residential
11 districts which allow for the construction of two (2) or more units. The number of attached single-
12 family units allowed shall be the same as the corresponding residential density for the property and

21 and otherwise made fit for occupancy. The property owner, or a properly designated agent of the

2 use within all zoning districts of a municipality, including all industrial and commercial zoning
3 districts, except where prohibited for public health or safety reasons or the protection of wildlife

6 for the conversion of any commercial building, including offices, schools, religious facilities,
7 medical buildings, and malls into residential units or mixed-use developments which include the
8 development of at least fifty percent (50%) of the existing gross floor area into residential units,
9 shall be a permitted use and allowed by specific and objective provisions of a zoning ordinance,
10 except where such is prohibited by environmental land use restrictions recorded on the property by
11 the state of Rhode Island department of environmental management or the United States
12 Environmental Protection Agency preventing the conversion to residential use.
13 (1) The specific zoning ordinance provisions for adaptive reuse shall exempt adaptive reuse
14 developments from off-street parking requirements of over one space per dwelling unit.
15 (2) Density.

23 private water, such as a well and and/or wastewater treatment system(s) approved by the relevant
24 state agency for the entire development as applicable.
25 (ii) For all other adaptive reuse projects, the residential density permitted in the converted
26 structure shall be the maximum allowed that otherwise meets all standards of minimum housing
27 and has access to public sewer and water service or has access to adequate private water, such as a
28 well, and wastewater treatment system(s) approved by the relevant state agency for the entire
29 development, as applicable. The density proposed shall be determined to meet all public health and
30 safety standards.
31 (3) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, for adaptive reuse projects,
32 existing building setbacks shall remain and shall be considered legal nonconforming, but no
33 additional encroachments shall be permitted into any nonconforming setback, unless otherwise
34 allowed by zoning ordinance or relief is granted by the applicable authority.

4 the height exemption.
5 (i) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, all towns and cities may allow
6 manufactured homes that comply with § 23-27.3-109.1.3 as a type of single-family home on any
7 lot zoned for single-family use. Such home shall comply with all dimensional requirements of a
8 single-family home in the district or seek relief for the same under the provisions of this chapter.

10 all towns and cities shall allow attached single-family units, as defined in § 45-24-33, in residential
