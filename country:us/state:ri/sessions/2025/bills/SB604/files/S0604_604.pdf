Introduced By: Senators Sosnowski, Murray, and Britto
Date Introduced: March 06, 2025
Referred To: Senate Commerce

It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Section 27-34-8 of the General Laws in Chapter 27-34 entitled "Rhode Island
2 Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Association" is hereby amended to read as follows:
3 27-34-8. Powers and duties of the association.
4 (a) The association shall:
5 (1)(i) Be obligated to pay covered claims existing prior to the order of liquidation; arising
6 within sixty (60) days after the order of liquidation or before the policy expiration date if less than
7 sixty (60) days after the order of liquidation or before the insured replaces the policy or causes its
8 cancellation if the insured does so within sixty (60) days of the order of liquidation. The obligations
9 shall be satisfied by paying to the claimant an amount as follows:
10 (A) The full amount of a covered claim for benefits under a workers’ compensation
11 insurance coverage;
12 (B) An amount not exceeding ten thousand dollars ($10,000), per policy for a covered
13 claim for the return of unearned premium;
14 (C) An amount not exceeding one million dollars ($1,000,000) for all first-party property
15 loss claims arising from a single occurrence under a policy covering commercial or residential
16 property for all other covered claims for insolvencies occurring after January 1, 2026; an amount
17 not exceeding five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000), per claimant for all other covered claims
18 for insolvencies occurring on or after January 1, 2008,; and an amount not exceeding three hundred

1 thousand dollars ($300,000) per claimant for all other covered claims for insolvencies occurring
2 prior to January 1, 2008.
3 (ii) In no event shall the association be obligated to pay a claimant an amount in excess of
4 the obligation of the insolvent insurer under the policy or coverage from which the claim arises.
5 Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a covered claim shall not include a claim filed
6 with the guaranty association after the final date set by the court for the filing of claims against the
7 liquidator or receiver of an insolvent insurer. For the purpose of filing a claim under this subsection,
8 notice of claims to the liquidator of the insolvent insurer shall be deemed notice to the association
9 or its agent and a list of claims shall be periodically submitted to the association or association
10 similar to the association in another state by the liquidator.
11 (iii) Any obligation of the association to defend an insured shall cease upon the
12 association’s payment or tender of an amount equal to the lesser of the association’s covered claim
13 obligation limit or the applicable policy limit;
14 (2) Be deemed the insurer to the extent of its obligation on the covered claims and to that
15 extent, subject to the limitation provided in this chapter, shall have all rights, duties, and obligations
16 of the insolvent insurer as if the insurer had not become insolvent, including, but not limited to, the
17 right to pursue and retain salvage and subrogation recoverable on covered claim obligations to the
18 extent paid by the association. The association shall not be deemed the insolvent insurer for the
19 purpose of conferring jurisdiction;
20 (3) Allocate claims paid and expenses incurred among the three (3) accounts separately,
21 and assess member insurers separately for each account amounts necessary to pay the obligations
22 of the association under subdivision (a)(1) subsequent to an insolvency, the expenses of handling
23 covered claims subsequent to an insolvency, and other expenses authorized by this chapter. The
24 assessments of each member insurer shall be in the proportion that the net direct written premiums
25 of the member insurer for the calendar year preceding the assessment on the kinds of insurance in
26 the account bears to the net direct written premiums of all member insurers for the calendar year
27 preceding the assessment on the kinds of insurance in the account. Each member insurer shall be
28 notified of the assessment not later than thirty (30) days before it is due.
29 A member insurer may not be assessed in any one year on any account an amount greater
30 than two percent (2%) of that member insurer’s net direct written premiums for the calendar year
31 preceding the assessment on the kinds of insurance in the account. If the maximum assessment,
32 together with the other assets of the association in any account, does not provide in any one year in
33 any account an amount sufficient to make all necessary payments from that account, each member
34 insurer shall be assessed the additional amount that must be obtained to make all necessary
LC001778 - Page 2 of 15

1 payments of the underfunded account from the other two accounts, subject to the same limitation
2 of two percent (2%) of that member insurer’s net direct written premiums for the calendar year
3 preceding the assessment on the kinds of insurance in the account. The additional assessments shall
4 be considered loans by and between the separate accounts. Amounts borrowed under this
5 subsection shall be paid back to the separate accounts from which they were borrowed, out of
6 assets, including, but not limited to, existing and future assessments in the account receiving the
7 loan. An interest charge shall be levied on all amounts borrowed under this subsection based on the
8 average prime rate of interest for each year the money remains unpaid. If the amounts borrowed
9 remain unpaid on the seventh yearly anniversary as a result of the inability of the borrowing account
10 to make repayment, then the amount borrowed and interest which is not repaid, starting with the
11 principal and interest of the first year, shall be considered uncollectible. The funds available shall
12 be prorated and the unpaid portion shall be paid as soon after this as funds become available. The
13 association may exempt or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of any member insurer if the
14 assessment would cause the member insurer’s financial statement to reflect amounts of capital or
15 surplus less than the minimum amounts required for a certificate of authority by any jurisdiction in
16 which the member insurer is authorized to transact insurance. However, during the period of
17 deferment, no dividends shall be paid to shareholders or policyholders. Deferred assessments shall
18 be paid when the payment will not reduce capital or surplus below required minimums. Payments
19 shall be refunded to those companies receiving larger assessments by virtue of the deferment, or,
20 at the election of any company, credited against future assessments;
21 (4) Investigate claims brought against the association and adjust, compromise, settle, and
22 pay covered claims to the extent of the association’s obligation and deny all other claims. The
23 association shall pay claims in any order that it may deem reasonable, including the payment of
24 claims as they are received from the claimants or in groups or categories of claims. The association
25 shall have the right to appoint and to direct legal counsel retained under liability insurance policies
26 for the defense of covered claims;
27 (5) Notify claimants in this state as deemed necessary by the commissioner and upon the
28 commissioner’s request, to the extent records are available to the association;
29 (6)(i) Have the right to review and contest as set forth in this subsection settlements,
30 releases, compromises, waivers, and judgments to which the insolvent insurer or its insureds were
31 parties prior to the entry of the order of liquidation. In an action to enforce settlements, releases,
32 and judgments to which the insolvent insurer or its insureds were parties prior to the entry of the
33 order of liquidation, the association shall have the right to assert the following defenses, in addition
34 to the defenses available to the insurer:
LC001778 - Page 3 of 15

1 (A) The association is not bound by a settlement, release, compromise, or waiver executed
2 by an insured or the insurer, or any judgment entered against an insured or the insurer by consent
3 or through a failure to exhaust all appeals, if the settlement, release, compromise, waiver, or
4 judgment was:
5 (I) Executed or entered into within one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the entry of an
6 order of liquidation, and the insured or the insurer did not use reasonable care in entering into the
7 settlement, release, compromise, waiver, or judgment, or did not pursue all reasonable appeals of
8 an adverse judgment; or
9 (II) Executed by or taken against an insured or the insurer based on default, fraud, collusion,
10 or the insurer’s failure to defend.
11 (B) If a court of competent jurisdiction finds that the association is not bound by a
12 settlement, release, compromise, waiver, or judgment for the reasons described in subparagraph
13 (i)(A), the settlement, release, compromise, waiver, or judgment shall be set aside, and the
14 association shall be permitted to defend any covered claim on the merits. The settlement, release,
15 compromise, waiver, or judgment may not be considered as evidence of liability or damages in
16 connection with any claim brought against the association or any other party under this chapter.
17 (C) The association shall have the right to assert any statutory defenses or rights of offset
18 against any settlement, release, compromise, or waiver executed by an insured or the insurer, or
19 any judgment taken against the insured or the insurer.
20 (ii) As to any covered claims arising from a judgment under any decision, verdict, or
21 finding based on the default of the insolvent insurer or its failure to defend, the association, either
22 on its own behalf or on behalf of an insured, may apply to have the judgment, order, decision,
23 verdict, or finding set aside by the same court or administrator that entered the judgment, order,
24 decision, verdict, or finding and shall be permitted to defend the claim on the merits;
25 (7) Handle claims through its employees or through one or more insurers or other persons
26 designated as servicing facilities. Designation of a servicing facility is subject to the approval of

29 and for expenses incurred by the facility while handling claims on behalf of the association and

5 the amount borrowed based on the premium for the preceding calendar year. The maximum line of
6 credit or preinsolvency assessment for each account shall be subject to prior review and approval

10 member insurer’s maximum assessment pursuant to subdivision (a)(3) to ensure the immediate
11 availability of funds for the purposes of future claims and expenses attributable to an insurer
12 insolvency.
13 Any amount drawn under any line of credit shall be considered a payment toward the
14 member insurer’s assessment provided for in subdivision (a)(3).

12 and shall not be deemed a public record pursuant to the provisions of chapter 2 of title 38.
13 (ii) That portion of a meeting of the commission or of a rate proceeding on an insurer’s rate
14 filing at which a trade secret made confidential and exempt by this paragraph is discussed shall be
15 deemed confidential and not open to disclosure pursuant to the open meetings act, but may be
16 discussed at a closed meeting as provided for in chapter 46 of title 42.
17 (d) The Rhode Island commission is hereby authorized to form a multi-state commission
18 with the states of Massachusetts, Connecticut, and any other interested state in furtherance of the
