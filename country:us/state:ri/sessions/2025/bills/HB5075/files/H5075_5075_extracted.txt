1 The Rhode Island public transit authority shall conduct a thorough review of its transit operations
2 and administration. The aim of this review is to uncover ways to enhance efficiency and streamline
3 costs, ensuring a more effective use of resources. This evaluation shall encompass a range of areas,
4 including but not limited to, a comprehensive analysis of the fixed-route service. Analysis should
5 include operating expenses, ridership figures, cost per rider, and other pertinent data across all
6 routes and serviced regions. A review focusing on the cost-effectiveness of the agency’s diverse
7 transit services will be a key component of this study. Additionally, the study shall explore different
8 transit service delivery models, incorporating successful strategies from other transit systems;
9 financial planning strategies; agency management structure, capital plan development, and funding
10 strategies; project management; and transit master plan scope and schedule. By March 1, 2025, the
11 Rhode Island public transit authority shall compile and present a report to the governor, the speaker
12 of the house, and the president of the senate. This report will summarize the findings of the study
13 and include recommendations aimed at fostering sustainable and effective transit operations.
