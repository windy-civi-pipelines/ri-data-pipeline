3 22-11-3.6. Revision of statutes -- Older adult to replace elder or elderly.
4 (a) Unless exempted by subsection (b) of this section, the law revision director is
5 empowered and directed to produce a bill for introduction in the 2026 legislative session that shall:
6 (1) Replace the terms "elder" and "elderly person(s)" as they appear throughout the general
7 laws with the term "older adult(s)";

9 laws in regard to elder or elderly person(s) with the term "adult person(s) with disabilities".
10 (b) The provisions of subsection (a) of this section shall not apply to:
11 (1) Title 42;
12 (2) Chapter 5 and chapter 68 of title 11;
13 (3) Chapter 19 of title 17;
14 (4) Chapter 34 of title 19; and
15 (5) Any other section of law where the substitution of the term "elder" or "elderly

21 42-11-10. Statewide planning program.

24 need for establishment of a comprehensive, strategic state planning process and the preparation,
25 maintenance, and implementation of plans for the physical, economic, and social development of
26 the state; the continued growth and development of the state presents problems that cannot be met
27 by the cities and towns individually and that require effective planning by the state; and state and

29 programs of the federal government.

EXPLANATION
BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL
OF
A N A C T
RELATING TO GENERAL ASSEMBLY -- JOINT COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATIVE
SERVICES
***
1 This act would advance the interests of older Rhode Islanders by adding a representative
2 of an aging adult organization to the state planning council and a permanent committee on aging to
3 the state planning council and would require the long-term care coordinating council to review and
4 make recommendations for reforming its governing statute, and would change the council’s
5 quorum to twelve (12) members. Additionally, the act would dispense with less-favored terms
6 related to older persons and persons with disabilities, and would direct the law revision director to
7 draft a bill for introduction in the 2026 legislative session to revise affected general laws, with
8 certain exceptions, where the term "elder person" would remain.
9 This act would take effect upon passage.
