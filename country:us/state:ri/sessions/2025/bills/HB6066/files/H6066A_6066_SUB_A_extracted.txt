INSURANCE -- GENERAL PROVISIONS
Introduced By: Representatives Giraldo, Potter, Voas, Stewart, Alzate, and Morales
Date Introduced: March 12, 2025
Referred To: House Labor
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Section 28-40-1 of the General Laws in Chapter 28-40 entitled "Temporary
2 Disability Insurance — Contributions" is hereby amended to read as follows:
3 28-40-1. Amount of employee contributions — Wages on which based.
4 (a) The taxable wage base under this chapter for each calendar year shall be equal to the
5 greater of thirty-eight thousand dollars ($38,000) one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) or the
6 annual earnings needed by an individual to qualify for the maximum weekly benefit amount and
7 the maximum duration under chapters 39 — 41 of this title. That taxable wage base shall be
8 computed as follows: Every September 30, the maximum weekly benefit amount in effect as of that
9 date shall be multiplied by thirty (30) and the resultant product shall be divided by thirty-six
10 hundredths (.36). If the result thus obtained is not an even multiple of one hundred dollars ($100),
11 it shall be rounded upward to the next higher even multiple of one hundred dollars ($100). That
12 taxable wage base shall be effective for the calendar year beginning on the next January 1.
13 (b) Each employee shall contribute with respect to employment after the date upon which
14 the employer becomes subject to chapters 39 — 41 of this title, an amount equal to the fund cost
15 rate times the wages paid by the employer to the employee up to the taxable wage base as defined
16 and computed in subsection (a) of this section. The employee contribution rate for the following
17 calendar year shall be determined by computing the fund cost rate on or before November 15 of
18 each year as follows:
1 (1) The total amount of disbursements made from the fund for the twelve-month (12)
2 period ending on the immediately preceding September 30 shall be divided by the total taxable
3 wages paid by employers during the twelve-month (12) period ending on the immediately
4 preceding June 30. The ratio thus obtained shall be multiplied by one hundred (100) and the
5 resultant product if not an exact multiple of one-tenth of one percent (0.1%) shall be rounded down
6 to the next lowest multiple of one-tenth of one percent (0.1%);
7 (2) If the fund balance as of the preceding September 30 is less than the total disbursements
8 from the fund for the six-month (6) period ending on that September 30, that difference shall be
9 added to the total disbursements for the twelve-month (12) period ending September 30 for the
10 purpose of computing the fund cost rate, and if the resulting fund cost rate is not an exact multiple
11 of one-tenth of one percent (0.1%) it shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of one-tenth of one
12 percent (0.1%).
13 SECTION 2. Sections 28-41-5, 28-41-34 and 28-41-35 of the General Laws in Chapter 28-
14 41 entitled "Temporary Disability Insurance — Benefits" are hereby amended to read as follows:
15 28-41-5. Weekly benefit rate — Dependents’ allowances. [Effective January 1, 2025.]
16 (a) Benefit rate.
17 (1) The benefit rate payable under this chapter to any eligible individual with respect to
18 any week of the individual’s unemployment due to sickness, when that week occurs within a benefit
19 year, shall be, for benefit years beginning on or after October 7, 1990, and prior to January 1, 2027,
20 four and sixty-two hundredths percent (4.62%); for benefit years beginning on or after January 1,
21 2027, and prior to January 1, 2028, five and thirty-eight hundredths percent (5.38%); and for benefit
22 years beginning on or after January 1, 2028, five and seventy-seven hundredths percent (5.77%) of
23 the wages paid to the individual in that calendar quarter of the base period in which the individual’s
24 wages were highest; provided, however, that the benefit rate shall not exceed eighty-five percent
25 (85%) of the average weekly wage paid to individuals covered by chapters 42 — 44 of this title for
26 the preceding calendar year ending December 31. If the maximum weekly benefit rate is not an
27 exact multiple of one dollar ($1.00) then the rate shall be raised to the next higher multiple of one
28 dollar ($1.00). Those weekly benefit rates shall be effective throughout the benefit years beginning
29 on or after July 1 of the year prior to July of the succeeding calendar year.
30 (2) The benefit rate of any individual, if not an exact multiple of one dollar ($1.00), shall
31 be raised to the next higher multiple of one dollar ($1.00).
32 (b) Dependents’ allowances. An individual to whom benefits for unemployment due to
33 sickness are payable under this chapter with respect to any week, shall, in addition to those benefits,
34 be paid with respect to each week a dependent’s allowance of twenty dollars ($20.00) or seven
LC002030/SUB A/2 - Page 2 of 8
1 percent (7%) of the individual’s benefit rate payable under subsection (a) of this section, whichever
2 is greater, for each of that individual’s children, including adopted and stepchildren or that
3 individual’s court-appointed wards who, at the beginning of the individual’s benefit year, is under
4 eighteen (18) years of age and who is at that time in fact dependent on that individual. A
5 dependent’s allowance shall also be paid to that individual for any child, including an adopted child
6 or a stepchild or that individual’s court appointed ward, eighteen (18) years of age or over,
7 incapable of earning any wages because of mental or physical incapacity, and who is dependent on
8 that individual in fact at the beginning of the individual’s benefit year, including individuals who
9 have been appointed the legal guardian of that child by the appropriate court. However, in no
10 instance shall the number of dependents for which an individual may receive dependents’
11 allowances exceed five (5) in total. The weekly total of dependents’ allowances payable to any
12 individual, if not an exact multiple of one dollar ($1.00), shall be rounded to the next lower multiple
13 of one dollar ($1.00). The number of an individual’s dependents, and the fact of their dependency,
14 shall be determined as of the beginning of that individual’s benefit year; provided, that only one
15 individual shall be entitled to a dependent’s allowance for the same dependent with respect to any
16 week. Each individual who claims a dependent’s allowance shall establish their claim to it to the
17 satisfaction of the director under procedures established by the director.
18 (c) Any individual’s benefit rate and/or dependents’ allowance in effect for a benefit year
19 shall continue in effect until the end of that benefit year.
20 (d) Partial unemployment due to sickness. For weeks beginning on or after January 1,
21 2006, an individual partially unemployed due to sickness and otherwise eligible in any week shall
22 be paid sufficient benefits with respect to that week, so that their wages, rounded to the next higher
23 multiple of one dollar ($1.00), and their benefits combined will equal in amount the weekly benefit
24 rate to which the individual would be entitled if totally unemployed due to sickness in that week;
25 provided that an individual must have been totally unemployed due to sickness for at least seven
26 (7) consecutive days prior to claiming partial benefits under this provision; provided, that this
27 provision shall not apply if the individual is entitled to lag day benefits pursuant to § 28-41-9;
28 provided, further, that nothing contained herein shall permit any individual to whom remuneration
29 is payable for any work performed in any week in an amount equal to or greater than his or her
30 weekly benefit rate to receive benefits or waiting period credit for that week.

Referred To: House Labor
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Section 28-40-1 of the General Laws in Chapter 28-40 entitled "Temporary
2 Disability Insurance — Contributions" is hereby amended to read as follows:
3 28-40-1. Amount of employee contributions — Wages on which based.
4 (a) The taxable wage base under this chapter for each calendar year shall be equal to the
5 greater of thirty-eight thousand dollars ($38,000) one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) or the
6 annual earnings needed by an individual to qualify for the maximum weekly benefit amount and
7 the maximum duration under chapters 39 — 41 of this title. That taxable wage base shall be
8 computed as follows: Every September 30, the maximum weekly benefit amount in effect as of that
9 date shall be multiplied by thirty (30) and the resultant product shall be divided by thirty-six
10 hundredths (.36). If the result thus obtained is not an even multiple of one hundred dollars ($100),
11 it shall be rounded upward to the next higher even multiple of one hundred dollars ($100). That
12 taxable wage base shall be effective for the calendar year beginning on the next January 1.
13 (b) Each employee shall contribute with respect to employment after the date upon which
14 the employer becomes subject to chapters 39 — 41 of this title, an amount equal to the fund cost
15 rate times the wages paid by the employer to the employee up to the taxable wage base as defined
16 and computed in subsection (a) of this section. The employee contribution rate for the following
17 calendar year shall be determined by computing the fund cost rate on or before November 15 of
18 each year as follows:

1 (1) The total amount of disbursements made from the fund for the twelve-month (12)
2 period ending on the immediately preceding September 30 shall be divided by the total taxable
3 wages paid by employers during the twelve-month (12) period ending on the immediately
4 preceding June 30. The ratio thus obtained shall be multiplied by one hundred (100) and the
5 resultant product if not an exact multiple of one-tenth of one percent (0.1%) shall be rounded down
6 to the next lowest multiple of one-tenth of one percent (0.1%);
7 (2) If the fund balance as of the preceding September 30 is less than the total disbursements
8 from the fund for the six-month (6) period ending on that September 30, that difference shall be
9 added to the total disbursements for the twelve-month (12) period ending September 30 for the
10 purpose of computing the fund cost rate, and if the resulting fund cost rate is not an exact multiple
11 of one-tenth of one percent (0.1%) it shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of one-tenth of one
12 percent (0.1%).
13 SECTION 2. Sections 28-41-5, 28-41-34 and 28-41-35 of the General Laws in Chapter 28-
14 41 entitled "Temporary Disability Insurance — Benefits" are hereby amended to read as follows:
15 28-41-5. Weekly benefit rate — Dependents’ allowances. [Effective January 1, 2025.]

18 any week of the individual’s unemployment due to sickness, when that week occurs within a benefit
19 year, shall be, for benefit years beginning on or after October 7, 1990, and prior to January 1, 2027,
20 four and sixty-two hundredths percent (4.62%); for benefit years beginning on or after January 1,

22 years beginning on or after January 1, 2028, five and seventy-seven hundredths percent (5.77%) of
23 the wages paid to the individual in that calendar quarter of the base period in which the individual’s
24 wages were highest; provided, however, that the benefit rate shall not exceed eighty-five percent
25 (85%) of the average weekly wage paid to individuals covered by chapters 42 — 44 of this title for
26 the preceding calendar year ending December 31. If the maximum weekly benefit rate is not an

28 dollar ($1.00). Those weekly benefit rates shall be effective throughout the benefit years beginning
29 on or after July 1 of the year prior to July of the succeeding calendar year.
30 (2) The benefit rate of any individual, if not an exact multiple of one dollar ($1.00), shall
31 be raised to the next higher multiple of one dollar ($1.00).

1 percent (7%) of the individual’s benefit rate payable under subsection (a) of this section, whichever
2 is greater, for each of that individual’s children, including adopted and stepchildren or that
3 individual’s court-appointed wards who, at the beginning of the individual’s benefit year, is under

10 instance shall the number of dependents for which an individual may receive dependents’
11 allowances exceed five (5) in total. The weekly total of dependents’ allowances payable to any
12 individual, if not an exact multiple of one dollar ($1.00), shall be rounded to the next lower multiple
13 of one dollar ($1.00). The number of an individual’s dependents, and the fact of their dependency,
14 shall be determined as of the beginning of that individual’s benefit year; provided, that only one
15 individual shall be entitled to a dependent’s allowance for the same dependent with respect to any

19 shall continue in effect until the end of that benefit year.
20 (d) Partial unemployment due to sickness. For weeks beginning on or after January 1,
21 2006, an individual partially unemployed due to sickness and otherwise eligible in any week shall
22 be paid sufficient benefits with respect to that week, so that their wages, rounded to the next higher
23 multiple of one dollar ($1.00), and their benefits combined will equal in amount the weekly benefit
24 rate to which the individual would be entitled if totally unemployed due to sickness in that week;
25 provided that an individual must have been totally unemployed due to sickness for at least seven
26 (7) consecutive days prior to claiming partial benefits under this provision; provided, that this
27 provision shall not apply if the individual is entitled to lag day benefits pursuant to § 28-41-9;
28 provided, further, that nothing contained herein shall permit any individual to whom remuneration
29 is payable for any work performed in any week in an amount equal to or greater than his or her
