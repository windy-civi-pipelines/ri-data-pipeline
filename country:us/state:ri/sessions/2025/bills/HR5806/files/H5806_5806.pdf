EXPRESSING CONDOLENCES ON THE PASSING OF MICHAEL CHARLES GERHARDT
Introduced By: Representatives Speakman, Knight, Shekarchi, Blazejewski,
Chippendale, Donovan, Kennedy, Ajello, Edwards, and Bennett
Date Introduced: February 27, 2025
Referred To: House read and passed
1 WHEREAS, It is with deep sadness that this House of Representatives has learned of the
2 passing of Michael Charles Gerhardt of Warren. Mr. Gerhardt was the beloved husband of Doree
3 Goodman for more than forty years; and
4 WHEREAS, Mr. Gerhardt graduated from Williams College with a Bachelor’s Degree in
5 Economics with Highest Honors in 1963. Two years later, he graduated from Harvard University
6 with a Master of Business Administration degree; and
7 WHEREAS, Shortly after receiving his Master’s Degree, Mr. Gerhardt began his
8 professional career with the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare in
9 Washington, D.C., as a Health Economist. Mr. Gerhardt moved to Rhode Island in 1970 to accept
10 a position to serve as the Director of Planning and Evaluation at the Providence Health Centers,
11 and later went on to serve in leadership positions at other healthcare organizations, before he
12 began a 14-year career with Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island where he served as a Vice
13 President of HMO Development and President and CEO of HMO RI; and
14 WHEREAS, After leaving Blue Cross, Mr. Gerhardt began a new career serving as an
15 interim director of nonprofits. He led sixteen organizations over a fifteen-year period, where he
16 quite often would have to stabilize internal management functions under difficult circumstances
17 and recruit a new qualified and motivated executive director. Some of the organizations he
18 managed included The Genesis Center, the Mount Hope Trust in Bristol, AIDS Project Rhode
19 Island, Save the Bay, and the Rhode Island Philharmonic Orchestra & Music School. Over the
20 course of his long and distinguished professional career, Mr. Gerhardt was widely admired by his

1 peers for his tireless work ethic, strong leadership skills and abiding integrity; and
2 WHEREAS, Michael Gerhardt was a strong believer in public service and giving back to
3 the community. He served on the Barrington Planning Board for ten years and, after moving to
4 Warren, was appointed to serve on the Warren Zoning Board of Review and, ten years later, to
5 the Warren Planning Board. Mr. Gerhardt also served on the Board of Trustees of the Warren
6 Land Trust for seven years. As its President, he greatly expanded its scope by bringing in gifts
7 and state grants to support the expanding functions of the organization; and
8 WHEREAS, In his free time, Mr. Gerhardt enjoyed sailing on his 30 foot Catalina, the
9 Pandion, where he primarily sailed Narragansett Bay, but also sailed throughout coastal New
10 England; and
11 WHEREAS, In addition to his wife, Doree Goodman, Mr. Gerhardt leaves behind his
12 sons, Geoffrey Charles Gerhardt and Michael Priestley Gerhardt. Mr. Gerhardt also leaves behind
13 his two step-sons, nine grandchildren, and one great-grandchild, Hannah Goodman. Mr. Gerhardt
14 also leaves behind his siblings, Thomas Gerhardt and Denis Newman; now, therefore be it
15 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
16 expresses its deepest condolences to the Gerhardt Family on the passing of Michael Charles
17 Gerhardt; and be it further
18 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
19 transmit certified copies of this resolution to Doree Goodman, Geoffrey Charles Gerhardt and
20 Michael Priestley Gerhardt.
