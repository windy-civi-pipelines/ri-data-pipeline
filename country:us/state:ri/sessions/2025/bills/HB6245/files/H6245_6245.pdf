10 (d) The membership of said task force shall receive no compensation for their services.

12 force may:

16 (iii) Compiled statistical information and any analyses of the data;
17 (2) Consult with experts in the criminal justice field; and

19 jurisdictions.

21 with the task force by providing accurate and timely information upon request and the joint
22 committee on legislative services is hereby authorized and directed to provide suitable quarters and
23 services necessary for said task force.

27 containing its recommendations for any necessary changes to current Rhode Island bail law, court
28 rules, procedures, and practices in the following areas:
