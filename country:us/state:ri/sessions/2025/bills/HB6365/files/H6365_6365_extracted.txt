RELATING TO TAXATION -- RETAIL DELIVERY FEE
Stewart, Giraldo, and Casimiro
Date Introduced: May 27, 2025
Referred To: House Finance
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. The general assembly hereby finds and declares that:
2 (1) In recent years, the number of retail deliveries of tangible personal property has rapidly
3 increased, and this rapid growth is expected to continue;
4 (2) The world economic forum estimates that by 2030, there will be over thirty percent
5 (30%) more delivery vehicles on roads to deliver seventy-eight percent (78%) more packages,
6 which will increase usage of the highways, roads and streets of the state by motor vehicles used to
7 make retail deliveries, and increase traffic congestion, and retail-delivery-related issues;
8 (3) This additional usage has accelerated and is expected to continue to accelerate
9 deterioration of surface transportation system infrastructure, and has required and is expected to
10 continue to require the state and municipalities to perform more maintenance and reconstruction of
11 state highway, and city streets;
12 (4) There are administrative costs for a retailer when the state imposes a fee on retail
13 deliveries, and the benefits from the fee revenue need to be balanced with the potential economic
14 impacts on the retailers;
15 (5) Fees on retail deliveries should only be imposed on retailers that are large enough to
16 absorb these administrative costs without significant economic harm;
17 (6) It is therefore necessary and appropriate:
18 (i) To impose a retail delivery fee to offset the potential cost to address infrastructure
19 deterioration related to retail delivery;
1 (ii) To create an exemption from the retail delivery fees for retailers with retail sales of five
2 hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) or less; and
3 (iii) To have the department of revenue collect the retail delivery fee from fee payers.
4 SECTION 2. Title 44 of the General Laws entitled "TAXATION" is hereby amended by
