14 is for the purchase, sale, lease, or making of contracts or for any other purpose in § 39-3-24
15 provided; and also the terms and conditions of the same. The division commission shall upon the

18 (b) The petition should may not be granted; that unless the facilities for furnishing service
19 to the public will not thereby be diminished; and that the purchase, sale, or lease and the terms
