17 (a) Any person who has reasonable cause to know or suspect that any child has been abused
18 or neglected as defined in § 40-11-2, or has been a victim of sexual abuse by another child, shall,
19 within twenty-four (24) hours, transfer that information to the department of children, youth and
20 families, or its agent, which shall cause the report to be investigated immediately. As a result of
21 those reports and referrals, protective social services shall be made available to those children in
22 an effort to safeguard and enhance the welfare of those children and to provide a means to prevent
23 further abuse or neglect. The department shall establish and implement a single, statewide, toll-free

LC000342 - Page 3 of 5
1 determination. The department shall continuously maintain a management-information database
2 that includes all of the information required to implement this section, including the number of
3 cases reported by hospitals, healthcare centers, emergency rooms, and other appropriate healthcare
4 facilities.
5 (b) The reporting shall include immediate notification of the department of any instance
6 where parents of an infant have requested deprivation of nutrition that is necessary to sustain life
7 and/or who have requested deprivation of medical or surgical intervention that is necessary to
8 remedy or ameliorate a life-threatening medical condition, if the nutrition or medical or surgical
9 intervention is generally provided to similar nutritional, medical, or surgical conditioned infants,
10 whether disabled or not.
11 No investigation shall be initiated against a parent or guardian for the sole reason that the
12 parent or guardian chose to delay or decline a vaccination for a child of the parent or under the care
13 of the guardian.
14 (c) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to prevent a child’s parents and physician
15 from discontinuing the use of life-support systems or nonpalliative treatment for a child who is
16 terminally ill where, in the opinion of the child’s physician exercising competent medical judgment,
