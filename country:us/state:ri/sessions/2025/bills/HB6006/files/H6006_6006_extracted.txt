13 principal amount of such capital development bonds and of any temporary notes outstanding at any
14 one time issued in anticipation thereof pursuant to section 7 hereof shall not exceed the total amount

6 refunding bonds issued under this act in the same manner as the capital development bonds issued

10 net the underwriters' cost, and cost of bond insurance, shall, upon their receipt, be paid by the
11 general treasurer immediately to the paying agent for the capital development bonds which are to

16 If the general treasurer shall deposit with the paying agent for the capital development
17 bonds the proceeds of the refunding bonds, or proceeds from other sources, amounts that, when
18 invested in obligations of the United States or the State of Rhode Island, are sufficient to pay all
19 principal, interest, and premium, if any, on the capital development bonds until these bonds are
20 called for prepayment, then such capital development bonds shall not be considered debts of the
21 State of Rhode Island for any purpose starting from the date of deposit of such monies with the

28 insurance, in one or more of the depositories in which the funds of the state may be lawfully kept
29 in special accounts (hereinafter cumulatively referred to as "such capital development bond fund")
30 appropriately designated for the project set forth in section 1 hereof which shall have been approved
31 by the people to be used for the purpose of paying the cost of the project so approved.
