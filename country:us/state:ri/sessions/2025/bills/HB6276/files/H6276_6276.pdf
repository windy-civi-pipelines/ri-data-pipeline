JANUARY SESSION, A.D. 2025

A N A C T
RELATING TO WATERS AND NAVIGATION -- RHODE ISLAND PROPERTY
RESILIENCE ACT
Introduced By: Representative Lauren H. Carson
Date Introduced: April 25, 2025
Referred To: House Finance
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Legislative intent.
2 (1) The general assembly recognizes that the state is particularly vulnerable to adverse
3 impacts from flooding resulting from increases in frequency and duration of rainfall events, storm
4 surge from more frequent and severe weather systems, and sea level rise. Such adverse impacts
5 pose economic, social, environmental, and public health and safety challenges to the state. To most
6 effectively address these challenges the state must prioritize addressing the most significant risks
7 to homes and businesses and in doing so helps to provide stability to the municipal tax base.
8 (2) The general assembly further recognizes that the adverse impacts of flooding and sea
9 level rise affect coastal and inland communities across the state. Consequently, a coordinated
10 approach is necessary to maximize the benefit of efforts to address such impacts and to improve
11 the state's resilience to flooding and sea level rise.
12 (3) The general assembly further recognizes that to effectively and efficiently address and
13 prepare for the adverse impacts of flooding and sea level rise in the state, it is necessary to conduct
14 property assessments in areas affected by flooding and sea level rise and develop a statewide
15 coordinated approach to addressing such risks.
16 (4) The general assembly in order to address these risks posed by flooding can initiate the
17 process through a state administered flood audit program supported by private sector expertise to
18 adapt to any risk and minimize increased insurance rates and property loss by providing property

1 owners of homes and businesses with actionable recommendations for reducing flood risks to
2 protect homes and commercial properties and achieve affordable and effective solutions to guide
3 building practices, retrofits, and mitigation programs for residential and commercial properties.
4 Legislative findings.
5 (a) The general assembly hereby finds that:
6 (1) It is declared to be a public benefit to encourage the rehabilitation and renovation of
7 commercial and residential buildings in a municipality and increase their resilience to storm surges,
8 sea level rise, extreme weather events, and precipitation;
9 (2) Flooding and storm-related erosion is causing problems for landowners on our open
10 ocean coastline and rivers;
11 (3) Rhode Island has a strong coastal resources management program that has historically
12 been very protective of natural shorelines;
13 (4) The special study commission created by resolution No. 392 passed by the house of
14 representatives at its January session A.D. 2015, and approved June 17 2015, entitled "House
15 Resolution Creating the Rhode Island House Commission on Economic Risk Due to Flooding and
16 Sea Rise" has determined:
17 (i) One of the best ways to prevent property damage due to sea level rise and flooding is to
18 fortify vulnerable assets, limit interruptions, protect property evaluations, and limit lost property
19 tax revenue;
20 (ii) The state needs to develop an approach and develop a philosophy of resilience;
21 (iii) Policymakers need to protect home and business owners by incentivizing resilience
22 thereby insuring our assets.
23 SECTION 2. Title 46 of the General Laws entitled "WATERS AND NAVIGATION" is
24 hereby amended by adding thereto the following chapter:
25 CHAPTER 23.5
26 RHODE ISLAND PROPERTY RESILIENCE ACT
27 46-23.5-1. Definitions.
28 As used in this chapter, the term:
29 (1) "Demolition" means to destroy or raze a building in cases in which a building is so
30 severely damaged that it cannot be elevated, floodproofed, or relocated, or the building is in such
31 poor condition and not worth the additional investment required to elevate, floodproof, or relocate.
32 (2) "Dry floodproofing of residential structures" means a structure is made watertight
33 below the level that needs flood protection to prevent floodwaters from entering. Making the
34 structure watertight requires sealing the walls with waterproof coatings, impermeable membranes,
LC002441 - Page 2 of 10

1 or supplemental layer of masonry or concrete.
2 (3) "Flood audit" means a comprehensive assessment of a property to identify flood risks
3 and recommend mitigation measures.
4 (4) "Flood audit programs" means programs for residential and commercial property
5 owners that are initiatives designed to help homeowners and businesses assess their flood risk and
6 identify mitigation strategies to protect properties from flooding.
7 (5) "Levee" and "floodwall" mean a long, narrow embankment usually built to protect land
8 from flooding. If built of concrete or masonry, the structure is usually referred to as a floodwall.
9 Levees and floodwalls confine streamflow within a specified area to prevent flooding.
10 (6) "Public-private partnership (PPP)" means a cooperative agreement between public
11 agencies and private entities to execute the program.
12 (7) "Relocation" means moving an entire building to another location on the same lot or to
13 another lot, usually outside the floodplain. Relocation is a mitigation measure that can offer the
14 greatest protection from future flooding.
15 (8) "Resilience", as defined by FEMA and the Hazard Mitigation Unified Guidance, means
16 and refers to the ability of individuals, communities, and systems to prepare for, respond to, recover
17 from, and adapt to adverse events, including natural disasters, hazards, or climate-related impacts.
18 The goal of resilience is to reduce the vulnerability to future disasters and ensure that communities
19 can continue to function during and after a hazard event. Key aspects of resilience include:
20 (i) Mitigation: Implementing proactive measures to reduce or eliminate the risks posed by
21 hazards, such as strengthening infrastructure or adopting land-use planning that minimizes flood
22 risks.
23 (ii) Adaptation: The capacity to make adjustment to systems or practices in response to
24 changing environmental conditions or experiences with past events.
25 (iii) Recovery: The ability to return to normal or even improve systems after an event
26 ensuring that communities can recover effectively from disasters.
27 (9) "Structural elevation" means various techniques used to raise the existing building to
28 or above the base flood elevation (BFE). Elevation is a common technique for protecting an existing
29 building in the special flood hazard area (SFHA).
30 (10) "Wet floodproofing" means a design method that allows water to move in the enclosed
31 parts of a home's lower area, such as the crawlspace or an unoccupied area and then out when water
32 recedes.
33 46-23.5-2. Rhode Island flood mitigation council.
34 (a) There is hereby established within the executive branch of state government a Rhode
