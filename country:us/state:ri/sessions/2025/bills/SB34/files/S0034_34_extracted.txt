3 44-18-7.3. Services defined.
4 (a) “Services” means all activities engaged in for other persons for a fee, retainer,

5 § 42-63.1-2, having any right, permission, license, or other authority from or through a hotel as
6 defined in § 42-63.1-2, to reserve, or arrange the transfer of occupancy of, accommodations the
7 reservation or transfer of which is subject to this chapter, such that the occupant pays all or a portion
8 of the rental and other fees to the room reseller or reseller. Room reseller or reseller shall include,
9 but not be limited to, sellers of travel packages as defined in this section. Notwithstanding the
10 provisions of any other law, where said reservation or transfer of occupancy is done using a room
11 reseller or reseller, the application of the sales and use tax under §§ 44-18-18 and 44-18-20, and
12 the hotel tax under § 44-18-36.1 shall be as follows: The room reseller or reseller is required to
13 register with, and shall collect and pay to, the tax administrator the sales and use and hotel taxes,
14 with said taxes being calculated upon the amount of rental and other fees paid by the occupant to
15 the room reseller or reseller, less the amount of any rental and other fees paid by the room reseller
16 or reseller to the hotel. The hotel shall collect and pay to the tax administrator said taxes upon the
17 amount of rental and other fees paid to the hotel by the room reseller or reseller and/or the occupant.
18 No assessment shall be made by the tax administrator against a hotel because of an incorrect
19 remittance of the taxes under this chapter by a room reseller or reseller. No assessment shall be
20 made by the tax administrator against a room reseller or reseller because of an incorrect remittance
21 of the taxes under this chapter by a hotel. If the hotel has paid the taxes imposed under this chapter,
22 the occupant and/or room reseller or reseller, as applicable, shall reimburse the hotel for said taxes.
23 If the room reseller or reseller has paid said taxes, the occupant shall reimburse the room reseller
24 or reseller for said taxes. Each hotel and room reseller or reseller shall add and collect, from the
25 occupant or the room reseller or the reseller, the full amount of the taxes imposed on the rental and
26 other fees. When added to the rental and other fees, the taxes shall be a debt owed by the occupant
27 to the hotel or room reseller or reseller, as applicable, and shall be recoverable at law in the same
28 manner as other debts. The amount of the taxes collected by the hotel and/or room reseller or
29 reseller from the occupant under this chapter shall be stated and charged separately from the rental
30 and other fees, and shall be shown separately on all records thereof, whether made at the time the
31 transfer of occupancy occurs, or on any evidence of the transfer issued or used by the hotel or the
32 room reseller or the reseller. A room reseller or reseller shall not be required to disclose to the
33 occupant the amount of tax charged by the hotel; provided, however, the room reseller or reseller
34 shall represent to the occupant that the separately stated taxes charged by the room reseller or
LC000232 - Page 2 of 4
1 reseller include taxes charged by the hotel. No person shall operate a hotel in this state, or act as a
2 room reseller or reseller for any hotel in the state, unless the tax administrator has issued a permit
3 pursuant to § 44-19-1.
4 (ii) “Travel package” means a room, or rooms, bundled with one or more other, separate
5 components of travel such as air transportation, car rental, or similar items, which travel package
6 is charged to the customer or occupant for a single, retail price. When the room occupancy is
7 bundled for a single consideration, with other property, services, amusement charges, or any other
8 items, the separate sale of which would not otherwise be subject to tax under this chapter, the entire
9 single consideration shall be treated as the rental or other fees for room occupancy subject to tax
10 under this chapter; provided, however, that where the amount of the rental, or other fees for room
11 occupancy is stated separately from the price of such other property, services, amusement charges,
12 or other items, on any sales slip, invoice, receipt, or other statement given the occupant, and such
13 rental and other fees are determined by the tax administrator to be reasonable in relation to the
14 value of such other property, services, amusement charges, or other items, only such separately
15 stated rental and other fees will be subject to tax under this chapter. The value of the transfer of any
16 room, or rooms, bundled as part of a travel package may be determined by the tax administrator
17 from the room reseller’s and/or reseller’s and/or hotel’s books and records that are kept in the
18 regular course of business.
19 (5) Investigation, Guard, and Armored Car Services (561611, 561612 & 561613).
20 (c) All services as defined herein are required to file a business application and registration
21 form and obtain a permit to make sales at retail with the tax administrator, to charge, collect, and
22 remit Rhode Island sales and use tax.

24 with the provisions of chapter 35 of title 42 to carry out the provisions, policies, and purposes of
25 this chapter.
26 SECTION 2. This act shall take effect upon passage.
