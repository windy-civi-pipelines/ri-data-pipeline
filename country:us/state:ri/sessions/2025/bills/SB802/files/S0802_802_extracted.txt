18 Effective from January 1, 2021, through June 30, 2022, the department shall also provide childcare
19 assistance to families with incomes below one hundred eighty percent (180%) of the federal poverty

4 2022 through December 31, 2024, the department shall also provide childcare assistance to families
5 with incomes below two hundred percent (200%) of the federal poverty level when such assistance

11 (c) No family/assistance unit shall be eligible for childcare assistance under this chapter if
12 the combined value of its liquid resources exceeds one million dollars ($1,000,000), which
13 corresponds to the amount permitted by the federal government under the state plan and set forth
14 in the administrative rulemaking process by the department. Liquid resources are defined as any
15 interest(s) in property in the form of cash or other financial instruments or accounts that are readily

17 union, or other financial institution savings, checking, and money market accounts; certificates of

19 or accounts. These do not include educational savings accounts, plans, or programs; retirement
20 accounts, plans, or programs; or accounts held jointly with another adult, not including a spouse.
21 The department is authorized to promulgate rules and regulations to determine the ownership and
22 source of the funds in the joint account.
23 (d) As a condition of eligibility for childcare assistance under this chapter, the parent or
24 caretaker relative of the family must consent to, and must cooperate with, the department in
25 establishing paternity, and in establishing and/or enforcing child support and medical support
26 orders for any children in the family receiving appropriate child care under this section in
27 accordance with the applicable sections of title 15, as amended, unless the parent or caretaker
28 relative is found to have good cause for refusing to comply with the requirements of this subsection.
29 (e) For purposes of this section, “appropriate child care” means child care, including infant,
30 toddler, preschool, nursery school, and school-age, that is provided by a person or organization
31 qualified, approved, and authorized to provide the care by the state agency or agencies designated
32 to make the determinations in accordance with the provisions set forth herein.
33 (f)(1) Families with incomes below one hundred percent (100%) of the applicable federal
34 poverty level guidelines shall be provided with free child care. Families with incomes greater than

1 one hundred percent (100%) and less than two hundred percent (200%) of the applicable federal
2 poverty guideline shall be required to pay for some portion of the child care they receive, according
3 to a sliding-fee scale adopted by the department in the department’s rules, not to exceed seven
4 percent (7%) of income as defined in subsection (h) of this section.
5 (2) Families who are receiving childcare assistance and who become ineligible for
6 childcare assistance as a result of their incomes exceeding two hundred sixty-one percent (261%)
7 of the applicable federal poverty guidelines shall continue to be eligible for childcare assistance
8 until their incomes exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the applicable federal poverty
9 guidelines. To be eligible, the families must continue to pay for some portion of the child care they
10 receive, as indicated in a sliding-fee scale adopted in the department’s rules, not to exceed seven
11 percent (7%) of income as defined in subsection (h) of this section, and in accordance with all other
12 eligibility standards.
13 (g) In determining the type of child care to be provided to a family, the department shall
14 take into account the cost of available childcare options; the suitability of the type of care available
15 for the child; and the parent’s preference as to the type of child care.
16 (h) For purposes of this section, “income” for families receiving cash assistance under §
17 40-5.2-11 means gross, earned income and unearned income, subject to the income exclusions in
18 §§ 40-5.2-10(g)(2) and 40-5.2-10(g)(3), and income for other families shall mean gross, earned and
19 unearned income as determined by departmental regulations.
20 (i) The caseload estimating conference established by chapter 17 of title 35 shall forecast
21 the expenditures for child care in accordance with the provisions of § 35-17-1.
22 (j) In determining eligibility for childcare assistance for children of members of reserve
23 components called to active duty during a time of conflict, the department shall freeze the family
24 composition and the family income of the reserve component member as it was in the month prior
25 to the month of leaving for active duty. This shall continue until the individual is officially
26 discharged from active duty.
27 (k) Effective from August 1, 2023, through July 31, 2025, the department shall provide
28 funding for child care for eligible childcare educators, and childcare staff, who work at least twenty

30 the department’s rules and regulations. Eligibility is limited to qualifying childcare educators and
31 childcare staff with family incomes up to three hundred percent (300%) of the applicable federal
