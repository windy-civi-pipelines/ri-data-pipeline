Introduced By: Senator Valarie J. Lawson
Date Introduced: January 10, 2025
Referred To: Placed on the Senate Consent Calendar
1 WHEREAS, It is with deep sadness that this Senate has learned of the passing of
2 Constance M. Silveira, the beloved wife of Joseph Silveira, Jr. for sixty-seven years, and the
3 mother of Patricia Whalen and her husband, Edward, Kathline Levesque, and the late Theresa
4 Correia, and mother-in-law of Keith Correia and the late Brian Levesque; and
5 WHEREAS, Mrs. Silveira, who was fondly known as "Connie" by her family and many
6 friends, was born in the City of Providence, and was the daughter of the late Anthony Vargas and
7 Mary Alexander. She had been adopted at the age of three and considered herself blessed to have
8 been chosen by such loving parents. Later in life, she had also had the opportunity to joyously
9 reunite with her birth family; and
10 WHEREAS, At the age of seventeen, Mrs. Silveira met the man who would become her
11 husband, and together they made their home and created "cherished memories" in the City of East
12 Providence. With a loving personality, Connie created and nurtured a marriage that flourished,
13 and a home that was warm and welcoming. She doted on her family, and loved being "nana" to
14 her eight grandchildren, three step-grandchildren, and thirteen great-grandchildren; and
15 WHEREAS, In addition to her family, for many years Mrs. Silveira had been a school
16 secretary at Grove Avenue School in East Providence, where she became an integral part of the
17 school's morale and acquired legions of extended grandchildren over the years. She and her
18 husband had also been the owners and operators of the former Silveira Paint & Wallpaper; and
19 WHEREAS, Connie Silveira led a wonderful life, traveling throughout New England and
1 Florida, spending summers on the Lake, visiting Faial in the Azores, and spending myriad days
2 and good times embraced by her family. She has left an indelible mark on the lives of those she
3 knew and loved, and she is dearly missed; now, therefore be it
4 RESOLVED, That this Senate of the State of Rhode Island hereby extends deepest
5 sympathies on the passing of Constance M. Silveira; and be it further
6 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
7 transmit duly certified copies of this resolution to Patricia Whalen and Family, Kathline Levesque
8 and Family, and Keith Correia and Family.
