15 that an employee of reasonable average ability earns at least the minimum wage established by §§
16 28-12-3 and 28-12-3.1, it shall be taken that the employer has complied with this statute. It shall be
17 of no concern to the director of labor and training how the employer arrives at its wage scale so
18 long as it is not unreasonable in its demands on the employee.
19 (f) Where, in the case of the employment of a full-time student who has not attained his or
20 her nineteenth (19th) birthday engaged in the activities of a nonprofit association or corporation,
21 whose aims and objectives are religious, educational, librarial, or community service in nature, the
22 employer-employee relationship does exist, the employer shall pay to each such employee wages
23 at a rate of not less than ninety percent (90%) of the minimum wage as specified in § 28-12-3. In
24 case of any conflict between provisions of this section and those of § 28-12-3.1, the provisions of
25 § 28-12-3.1 shall govern.
26 SECTION 2. This act shall take effect upon passage.
