PROCLAIMING MARCH 14TH AS A DAY TO COMMEMORATE THE HISTORY OF THE

SYMBOL
Introduced By: Senators DiPalma, Lauria, Felag, Raptakis, LaMountain, Gu, Urso,
Mack, Britto, and Rogers
Date Introduced: March 13, 2025
Referred To: Recommended for Immediate Consideration
1 WHEREAS, The mathematical constant π (pi) is an irrational number that represents the
2 ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter; and
3 WHEREAS, The history of π dates back to ancient civilizations, with contributions from
4 mathematicians such as Archimedes, Liu Hui, and Aryabhata; and
5 WHEREAS, The symbol π was first used by the Welsh mathematician William Jones in
6 1706, and later popularized by the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler in the 18th century; and
7 WHEREAS, The calculation of π has been an ongoing pursuit of precision, leading to the
8 development of various methods and algorithms including, but not limited to, Archimedes'
9 method, infinite series, and modern computer-based techniques; and
10 WHEREAS, The celebration of Pi Day on March 14th (3/14) has become a global
11 tradition, symbolizing the first three digits of π and promoting an appreciation for mathematics,
12 science, and education; and
13 WHEREAS, The first 100 digits of Pi are as follows: 3.1415926535 8979323846
14 2643383279 5028841971 6939937510 5820974944 5923078164 0628620899 8628034825
15 3421170679, which can be approximated to be 3.14; and
16 WHEREAS, The transcendental and infinite nature of π reflects the boundless
17 possibilities and challenges inherent in the pursuit of knowledge; now, therefore be it
18 RESOLVED, That this Senate of the State of Rhode Island hereby acknowledges and
19 honors the historical significance of π, recognizing its enduring importance in the realms of

1 mathematics, science, and education; and be it further
2 RESOLVED That this Senate hereby encourages educational institutions, community
3 organizations, and individuals to celebrate Pi Day by engaging in activities that promote the
4 understanding and appreciation of mathematics, fostering a spirit of curiosity and exploration;
5 and be it further
6 RESOLVED, That this Senate hereby declares March 14th to be a day to commemorate
7 the history of π and encourages citizens to reflect upon the contributions of mathematicians
8 throughout the ages in advancing our understanding of this fundamental constant.
9 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
10 transmit a duly certified copy of this resolution to Elizabeth Brownlee, President of the Rhode
11 Island Mathematics Teachers Association.
