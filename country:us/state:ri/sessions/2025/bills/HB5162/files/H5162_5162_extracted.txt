7 The system shall:
8 (1) Include instruments designed to assess the extent to which schools and LEAs succeed
9 in improving or fail to improve student performance, as defined by:

18 (3) In its design and application, strike a balance among considerations of accuracy,

2 valid sampling basis. Such instruments shall:
3 (i) Be criterion-referenced, assessing whether students are meeting the academic standards
4 described in this chapter;
5 (ii) As much as is practicable, especially in the case of students whose performance is
6 difficult to assess using conventional methods, include consideration of work samples, projects,

9 and communities in the state, and between students in other states and in other nations, especially
10 those nations that compete with the state for employment and economic opportunities;
11 (iv) Be designed to avoid gender, cultural, ethnic, or racial stereotypes; and
12 (v) Recognize sensitivity to different learning styles and impediments to learning, which
13 may include issues related, but not limited, to cultural, financial, emotional, health, and social

16 students in the state and the particular circumstances of students with special needs.
17 (6) Comply with federal requirements for accommodating children with special needs.
18 (7) Allow all potential English-proficient students from language groups in which English
19 language learner programs are offered opportunities for assessment of their performance in the
20 language that best allows them to demonstrate educational achievement and mastery of academic
21 standards and curriculum frameworks.
22 (8) Identify individual schools and LEAs that need comprehensive support and
23 improvement.
24 (9) Incorporate the department of elementary and secondary education's SurveyWorks
25 school climate indicators, or any other such future system used as a replacement or substitute for
26 SurveyWorks to measure school climate indicators, disaggregated by LEAs and individual public
27 schools.
28 (b) The board shall take all appropriate action to bring about and continue the state’s
29 participation in the assessment activities of the National Assessment of Educational Progress and
30 in the development of standards and assessments by the New Standards Program.
31 (c) In addition, comprehensive diagnostic assessment of individual students shall be
32 conducted at least in the fourth, eighth, and tenth or eleventh grades. The diagnostic assessments
33 shall identify academic achievement levels of all students in order to inform teachers, parents,
34 administrators, and the students themselves, as to individual academic performance.
