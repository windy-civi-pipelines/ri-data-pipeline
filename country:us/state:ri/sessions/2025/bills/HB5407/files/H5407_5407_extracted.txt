It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Section 16-16-12 of the General Laws in Chapter 16-16 entitled "Teachers’
2 Retirement [See Title 16 Chapter 97 — The Rhode Island Board of Education Act]" is hereby
3 amended to read as follows:
4 16-16-12. Procedure for service retirement.
5 Retirement of a member on a service retirement allowance shall be made by the retirement
6 board as follows:
7 (a)(i) Any member may retire upon his or her written application to the retirement board
8 as of the first day of the calendar month in which the application was filed, provided the member
9 was separated from service prior to filing the application, and further provided however, that if
10 separation from service occurs during the month in which the application is filed, the effective date
11 shall be the first day following the separation from service, and provided further that the member
12 on retirement date has attained the age of sixty (60) years and has completed at least ten (10) years
13 of contributory service on or before July 1, 2005, or regardless of age has completed twenty-eight
14 (28) years of total service and has completed at least ten (10) years of contributory service on or
15 before July 1, 2005, and who retire before October 1, 2009, or are eligible to retire as of September
16 30, 2009.
17 (ii) For teachers who become eligible to retire on or after October 1, 2009, and prior to July
18 1, 2012, benefits are available to teachers who have attained the age of sixty-two (62) and
1 completed at least ten (10) years of contributory service. For teachers in service as of October 1,
2 2009, who were not eligible to retire as of September 30, 2009, but became eligible to retire prior
3 to July 1, 2012, the minimum retirement age of sixty-two (62) will be adjusted downward in
4 proportion to the amount of service the member has earned as of September 30, 2009. The
5 proportional formula shall work as follows:
6 (A) The formula shall determine the first age of retirement eligibility under the laws in
7 effect on September 30, 2009, which shall then be subtracted from the minimum retirement age of
8 sixty-two (62).
9 (B) The formula shall then take the teacher’s total service credit as of September 30, 2009,
10 as the numerator and the years of service credit determined under (A) as the denominator.
11 (C) The fraction determined in (B) shall then be multiplied by the age difference in (1) to
12 apply a reduction in years from age sixty-two (62).
13 (b)(i) Any member, who has not completed at least ten (10) years of contributory service
14 on or before July 1, 2005, may retire upon his or her written application to the retirement board as
15 of the first day of the calendar month in which the application was filed; provided, the member was
16 separated from service prior thereto; and further provided, however, that if separation from service
17 occurs during the month in which application is filed, the effective date shall be the first day
18 following that separation from service; provided, the member on his or her retirement date had
19 attained the age of fifty-nine (59) and had completed at least twenty-nine (29) years of total service;
20 or provided, that the member on his or her retirement date had attained the age of sixty-five (65)
21 and had completed at least ten (10) years of contributory service; or provided, that the member on
22 his or her retirement date had attained the age of fifty-five (55) and had completed twenty (20)
23 years of total service and provided, that the retirement allowance, as determined according to the
24 formula in § 16-16-13 is reduced actuarially for each month that the age of the member is less than
25 sixty-five (65) years and who retire before October 1, 2009, or are eligible to retire as of September
26 30, 2009.
27 (ii) For teachers who become eligible to retire on or after October 1, 2009, and prior to July
28 1, 2012, benefits are available to teachers who have attained the age of sixty-two (62) and have
29 completed at least twenty-nine (29) years of total service or have attained the age of sixty-five (65)
30 and completed at least ten (10) years of contributory service. For teachers in service as of October

32 to July 1, 2012, who have a minimum retirement age of sixty-two (62), the retirement age will be
33 adjusted downward in proportion to the amount of service the member has earned as of September
34 30, 2009. The proportional formula shall work as follows:
LC001106 - Page 2 of 15
1 (A) The formula shall determine the first age of retirement eligibility under the laws in
2 effect on September 30, 2009, which shall then be subtracted from the minimum retirement age of
3 sixty-two (62).
4 (B) The formula shall then take the teacher’s total service credit as of September 30, 2009,
5 as the numerator and the years of service credit determined under (A) as the denominator.
6 (C) The fraction determined in (B) shall then be multiplied by the age difference
7 determined in (A) to apply a reduction in years from age sixty-two (62).

19 work as follows:
20 (1) The formula shall determine the first age of retirement eligibility under the laws in

22 (2) The formula shall then take the teacher’s total service credit as of June 30, 2012, as the
23 numerator and the projected service at retirement age in effect on June 30, 2012, as the
24 denominator;
25 (3) The fraction determined in (2) shall then be multiplied by the age difference determined
26 in (1) to apply a reduction in years from Social Security retirement age.
27 (iii) Effective July 1, 2015, a teacher who has completed twenty (20) or more years of total
28 service and who has attained an age within five (5) years of the eligible retirement age under

21 (7) A member who fails to cooperate with the retirement board shall not have the time of
22 service counted toward total service credit until such time as the member cooperates with the
23 retirement board and until such time as the retirement board determines the validity of the service

25 (8) A member who knowingly makes a false statement to the retirement board regarding
26 service time or credit shall not be entitled to a retirement allowance and is entitled only to the return
27 of his or her contributions without interest.

34 member’s written application to the retirement board as of the first day of the calendar month in

1 which the application was filed, provided the member was separated from service prior to the
2 application, and provided, further, that if separation from service occurs during the month in which
3 application is filed, the effective date is the first day following the separation from service, provided
4 that the member at the time so specified for the member’s retirement has attained the applicable
5 minimum retirement age and has completed at least ten (10) years of total service or who, regardless
6 of age, completed thirty (30) years of total service, and notwithstanding that during the period of

23 (2) The formula shall then take the member’s total service credit as of June 30, 2012, as
24 the numerator and the projected service at retirement age in effect on June 30, 2012, as the
25 denominator;
26 (3) The fraction determined in (2) shall then be multiplied by the age difference determined
27 in (1) to apply a reduction in years from Social Security retirement age.

8 completed ten (10) or more years of contributory service as of June 30, 2012, may elect to retire at

27 the affirmative duty to disclose to the retirement board whether or not he or she is a vested member
28 in any other retirement system and/or is receiving a pension retirement allowance or any annual
29 payment for life. The retirement board has the right to investigate whether or not the member has
30 utilized the same time of service for credit in any other retirement system. The member has an
31 affirmative duty to cooperate with the retirement board including, by way of illustration and not by
32 way of limitation, the duty to furnish or have furnished to the retirement board any relevant
33 information which is protected by any privacy act.
34 (6) A member who fails to cooperate with the retirement board shall not have the time of

3 amended to read as follows:
4 16-16-12. Procedure for service retirement.
5 Retirement of a member on a service retirement allowance shall be made by the retirement
6 board as follows:
7 (a)(i) Any member may retire upon his or her written application to the retirement board
8 as of the first day of the calendar month in which the application was filed, provided the member
9 was separated from service prior to filing the application, and further provided however, that if
10 separation from service occurs during the month in which the application is filed, the effective date
11 shall be the first day following the separation from service, and provided further that the member
12 on retirement date has attained the age of sixty (60) years and has completed at least ten (10) years
13 of contributory service on or before July 1, 2005, or regardless of age has completed twenty-eight

15 before July 1, 2005, and who retire before October 1, 2009, or are eligible to retire as of September

17 (ii) For teachers who become eligible to retire on or after October 1, 2009, and prior to July
18 1, 2012, benefits are available to teachers who have attained the age of sixty-two (62) and

1 completed at least ten (10) years of contributory service. For teachers in service as of October 1,
2 2009, who were not eligible to retire as of September 30, 2009, but became eligible to retire prior
3 to July 1, 2012, the minimum retirement age of sixty-two (62) will be adjusted downward in
4 proportion to the amount of service the member has earned as of September 30, 2009. The
5 proportional formula shall work as follows:
6 (A) The formula shall determine the first age of retirement eligibility under the laws in
7 effect on September 30, 2009, which shall then be subtracted from the minimum retirement age of
8 sixty-two (62).
9 (B) The formula shall then take the teacher’s total service credit as of September 30, 2009,
10 as the numerator and the years of service credit determined under (A) as the denominator.
11 (C) The fraction determined in (B) shall then be multiplied by the age difference in (1) to
12 apply a reduction in years from age sixty-two (62).
13 (b)(i) Any member, who has not completed at least ten (10) years of contributory service
14 on or before July 1, 2005, may retire upon his or her written application to the retirement board as
15 of the first day of the calendar month in which the application was filed; provided, the member was
16 separated from service prior thereto; and further provided, however, that if separation from service
17 occurs during the month in which application is filed, the effective date shall be the first day
18 following that separation from service; provided, the member on his or her retirement date had
19 attained the age of fifty-nine (59) and had completed at least twenty-nine (29) years of total service;
20 or provided, that the member on his or her retirement date had attained the age of sixty-five (65)
21 and had completed at least ten (10) years of contributory service; or provided, that the member on
22 his or her retirement date had attained the age of fifty-five (55) and had completed twenty (20)
23 years of total service and provided, that the retirement allowance, as determined according to the
24 formula in § 16-16-13 is reduced actuarially for each month that the age of the member is less than
25 sixty-five (65) years and who retire before October 1, 2009, or are eligible to retire as of September
26 30, 2009.
27 (ii) For teachers who become eligible to retire on or after October 1, 2009, and prior to July
28 1, 2012, benefits are available to teachers who have attained the age of sixty-two (62) and have
29 completed at least twenty-nine (29) years of total service or have attained the age of sixty-five (65)
30 and completed at least ten (10) years of contributory service. For teachers in service as of October

32 to July 1, 2012, who have a minimum retirement age of sixty-two (62), the retirement age will be
33 adjusted downward in proportion to the amount of service the member has earned as of September
34 30, 2009. The proportional formula shall work as follows:
LC001106 - Page 2 of 15

1 (A) The formula shall determine the first age of retirement eligibility under the laws in
2 effect on September 30, 2009, which shall then be subtracted from the minimum retirement age of
3 sixty-two (62).
4 (B) The formula shall then take the teacher’s total service credit as of September 30, 2009,
5 as the numerator and the years of service credit determined under (A) as the denominator.
6 (C) The fraction determined in (B) shall then be multiplied by the age difference
7 determined in (A) to apply a reduction in years from age sixty-two (62).
8 (c) Effective July 1, 2012, the following shall apply to all teachers not eligible to retire
9 prior to July 1, 2012:

17 under this subparagraph (ii) be prior to the attainment of age fifty-nine (59) or prior to the teacher’s
18 retirement age determined under the laws in effect on June 30, 2012. The proportional formula shall
19 work as follows:
20 (1) The formula shall determine the first age of retirement eligibility under the laws in
21 effect on June 30, 2012, which shall then be subtracted from Social Security retirement age;
22 (2) The formula shall then take the teacher’s total service credit as of June 30, 2012, as the
23 numerator and the projected service at retirement age in effect on June 30, 2012, as the
24 denominator;
25 (3) The fraction determined in (2) shall then be multiplied by the age difference determined
26 in (1) to apply a reduction in years from Social Security retirement age.
27 (iii) Effective July 1, 2015, a teacher who has completed twenty (20) or more years of total
28 service and who has attained an age within five (5) years of the eligible retirement age under
29 subdivisions (c)(i) or (c)(ii) above or subsection (d) below, may elect to retire provided that the

LC001106 - Page 5 of 15

1 service time or credit shall not be entitled to a retirement allowance and is entitled only to the return
2 of his or her contributions without interest.
3 SECTION 2. Section 36-10-9 of the General Laws in Chapter 36-10 entitled "Retirement
4 System — Contributions and Benefits" is hereby amended to read as follows:
5 36-10-9. Retirement on service allowance — In general.
6 Retirement of a member on a service retirement allowance shall be made by the retirement
7 board as follows:
8 (1)(a)(i) Any member may retire upon his or her written application to the retirement board
9 as of the first day of the calendar month in which the application was filed; provided, the member
10 was separated from service prior thereto; and further provided, however, that if separation from
11 service occurs during the month in which application is filed, the effective date shall be the first
12 day following that separation from service; and provided further that the member on his or her
13 retirement date attained the age of sixty (60) and completed at least ten (10) years of contributory
14 service on or before July 1, 2005, or who, regardless of age, has completed twenty-eight (28) years
15 of total service and has completed at least ten (10) years of contributory service on or before July
16 1, 2005, and who retire before October 1, 2009, or are eligible to retire as of September 30, 2009.
17 (ii) For members who become eligible to retire on or after October 1, 2009, and prior to
18 July 1, 2012, benefits are available to members who have attained the age of sixty-two (62) and
19 completed at least ten (10) years of contributory service. For members in service as of October 1,
20 2009, who were not eligible to retire as of September 30, 2009, but become eligible to retire prior
21 to July 1, 2012, the minimum retirement age of sixty-two (62) will be adjusted downward in
22 proportion to the amount of service the member has earned as of September 30, 2009. The
23 proportional formula shall work as follows:
24 (1) The formula shall determine the first age of retirement eligibility under the laws in
25 effect on September 30, 2009, which shall then be subtracted from the minimum retirement age of
26 sixty-two (62).
27 (2) The formula shall then take the member’s total service credit as of September 30, 2009,
28 as the numerator and the years of service credit determined under (1) as the denominator.
29 (3) The fraction determined in (2) shall then be multiplied by the age difference determined
30 in (1) to apply a reduction in years from age sixty-two (62).
31 (b)(i) Any member, who has not completed at least ten (10) years of contributory service
32 on or before July 1, 2005, may retire upon his or her written application to the retirement board as
33 of the first day of the calendar month in which the application was filed; provided, the member was
34 separated from service prior thereto; and further provided, however, that if separation from service
LC001106 - Page 6 of 15

1 occurs during the month in which application is filed, the effective date shall be the first day
2 following that separation from service; provided, the member or his or her retirement date had
3 attained the age of fifty-nine (59) and had completed at least twenty-nine (29) years of total service
4 or provided that the member on his or her retirement date had attained the age of sixty-five (65)
5 and had completed at least ten (10) years of contributory service; or provided, that the member on
6 his or her retirement date had attained the age of fifty-five (55) and had completed twenty (20)
7 years of total service provided, that the retirement allowance, as determined according to the
8 formula in § 36-10-10 is reduced actuarially for each month that the age of the member is less than
9 sixty-five (65) years, and who retire before October 1, 2009, or are eligible to retire as of September
10 30, 2009.
11 (ii) For members who become eligible to retire on or after October 1, 2009 and prior to
12 July 1, 2012, benefits are available to members who have attained the age of sixty-two (62) and
13 completed at least twenty-nine (29) years of total service or have attained the age of sixty-five (65)
14 and completed at least ten (10) years of contributory service. For members in service as of October
15 1, 2009, who were not eligible to retire as of September 30, 2009, but become eligible to retire prior
16 to July 1, 2012, who have a minimum retirement age of sixty-two (62), the retirement age will be
17 adjusted downward in proportion to the amount of service the member has earned as of September
18 30, 2009. The proportional formula shall work as follows:
19 (1) The formula shall determine the first age of retirement eligibility under the laws in
20 effect on September 30, 2009, which shall then be subtracted from the minimum retirement age of
21 sixty-two (62).
22 (2) The formula shall then take the member’s total service credit as of September 30, 2009,
23 as the numerator and the years of service credit determined under (1) as the denominator.
24 (3) The fraction determined in (2) above shall then be multiplied by the age difference
25 determined in (1) to apply a reduction in years from age sixty-two (62).
26 (c) Effective July 1, 2012, the following shall apply to all members not eligible to retire
27 prior to July 1, 2012:
28 (i) A member with contributory service on or after July 1, 2012, shall be eligible to retire

32 with contributory service on and after July 1, 2012, who have a retirement age of Social Security
33 Retirement Age, the retirement age will be adjusted downward in proportion to the amount of
34 service the member has earned as of June 30, 2012, but in no event shall a member’s retirement
LC001106 - Page 7 of 15

1 age under this subparagraph (ii) be prior to the attainment of age fifty-nine (59) or prior to the
2 member’s retirement age determined under the laws in effect on June 30, 2012. The proportional
3 formula shall work as follows:
4 (1) The formula shall determine the first age of retirement eligibility under the laws in
5 effect on June 30, 2012, which shall then be subtracted from Social Security retirement age;
6 (2) The formula shall then take the member’s total service credit as of June 30, 2012, as
7 the numerator and the projected service at retirement age in effect on June 30, 2012, as the
8 denominator;
9 (3) The fraction determined in (2) shall then be multiplied by the age difference determined
10 in (1) to apply a reduction in years from Social Security retirement age.
11 (iii) Effective July 1, 2015, a member who has completed twenty (20) or more years of
12 total service and who has attained an age within five (5) years of the eligible retirement age under
13 subparagraphs (c)(i) or (c)(ii) above or subsection (d) below, may elect to retire provided that the

27 that a member making an election under this paragraph shall receive the member’s retirement
28 benefit determined and calculated based on the member’s service and average compensation as of
