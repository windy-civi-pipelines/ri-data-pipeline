PROCLAIMING MARCH AS "COLORECTAL CANCER AWARENESS MONTH" IN THE
STATE OF RHODE ISLAND
Introduced By: Representatives Ackerman, Shekarchi, Blazejewski, Cotter,
Chippendale, Paplauskas, McNamara, Kennedy, Handy, and Diaz
Date Introduced: March 04, 2025
Referred To: House read and passed
1 WHEREAS, The American Cancer Society encourages the citizens of the State of Rhode
2 Island to observe March, 2025, as "Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month"; and
3 WHEREAS, Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths among
4 men and women combined in Rhode Island as well as in the United States; and
5 WHEREAS, According to the American Cancer Society, in 2025 there will be an
6 estimated 104,270 new cases of colon and rectal cancer in the United States and 52,900 deaths
7 from colorectal cancer. In Rhode Island, it is estimated that there will be 470 new cases of
8 colorectal cancer in 2024, and 150 deaths from colorectal cancer; and
9 WHEREAS, When colorectal cancer is found early, it has a survival rate of 90 percent,
10 but left undetected, survival rates for colorectal cancer can plummet to 10 percent; and
11 WHEREAS, There are often no symptoms of colorectal cancer, but regular screenings
12 can significantly reduce the number of deaths from this disease by detecting cancerous or pre-
13 cancerous conditions early, when treatment is most effective; and
14 WHEREAS, Education can help inform the public of methods of early detection and
15 prevention. Colorectal cancer is largely preventable with screening tests that find and remove pre-
16 cancerous polyps; and
17 WHEREAS, Working with the legislature, the American Cancer Society remains
18 committed and dedicated to informing the public about colorectal cancer prevention and
19 screening; now, therefore be it

1 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
2 proclaims March of 2025, as "Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month"; and be it further
3 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
4 transmit duly certified copies of this resolution to the American Cancer Society, and President
5 Amy S. Oxentenko, MD, FACG, American College of Gastroenterology.
