13 amended to read as follows:
14 46-23-1. Legislative findings.
15 (a)(1) Under article 1, § 17 of the Rhode Island Constitution, the people shall continue to
16 enjoy and freely exercise all the rights of fishery, and the privileges of the shore, to which they
17 have been heretofore entitled under the charter and usages of this state, including, but not limited
18 to, fishing from the shore, the gathering of seaweed, leaving the shore to swim in the sea and
1 passage along the shore; and they shall be secure in their rights to use and enjoyment of the natural
2 resources of the state with due regard for the preservation of their values; and it is the duty of the
3 general assembly to provide for the conservation of the air, land, water, plant, animal, mineral and
4 other natural resources of the state, and to adopt all means necessary and proper by law to protect
5 the natural environment of the people of the state by providing adequate resource planning for the
6 control and regulation of the use of the natural resources of the state and for the preservation,
7 regeneration, and restoration of the natural environment of the state.
8 (2) The general assembly recognizes and declares that the coastal resources of Rhode
9 Island, a rich variety of natural, commercial, industrial, recreational, and aesthetic assets, are of
10 immediate and potential value to the present and future development of this state; that unplanned
11 or poorly planned development of this basic natural environment has already damaged or destroyed,
12 or has the potential of damaging or destroying, the state’s coastal resources, and has restricted the
13 most efficient and beneficial utilization of these resources; that it shall be the policy of this state to
14 preserve, protect, develop, and, where possible, restore the coastal resources of the state for this
15 and succeeding generations through comprehensive and coordinated long range planning and
16 management designed to produce the maximum benefit for society from these coastal resources;
17 and that preservation and restoration of ecological systems shall be the primary guiding principle
18 upon which environmental alteration of coastal resources will be measured, judged, and regulated.
19 (b)(1) That effective implementation of these policies is essential to the social and
20 economic well-being of the people of Rhode Island because the sea and its adjacent lands are major
21 sources of food and public recreation, because these resources are used by and for industry,
22 transportation, waste disposal, and other purposes, and because the demands made on these
23 resources are increasing in number, magnitude, and complexity; and that these policies are
24 necessary to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare. Pursuant to 16 U.S.C. § 1452
25 (“The Coastal Zone Management Act”), the general assembly hereby directs the council department
26 of coastal resources (referred to as “CRMC” the "department") to exercise effectively its
27 responsibilities in the coastal zone through the development and implementation of management
28 programs to achieve wise use of the land and water resources of the coastal zone.
29 (2) Furthermore, that implementation of these policies is necessary in order to secure the
30 rights of the people of Rhode Island to the use and enjoyment of the natural resources of the state
31 with due regard for the preservation of their values, and in order to allow the general assembly to
32 fulfill its duty to provide for the conservation of the air, land, water, plant, animal, mineral, and
33 other natural resources of the state, and to adopt all means necessary and proper by law to protect
34 the natural environment of the people of the state by providing adequate resource planning for the
LC001019 - Page 2 of 34
1 control and regulation of the use of the natural resources of the state and for the preservation,
2 regeneration, and restoration of the natural environment of the state.
3 (c) That these policies can best be achieved through the creation of a coastal resources
4 management council department of coastal resources as the principal mechanism for management
5 of the state’s coastal resources.
6 (d) The general assembly recognizes and declares that maintenance dredging is required to
7 remove natural silt accumulations; Rhode Island has not had a general maintenance dredging policy
8 and programs for ports, port facilities, channels, harbors, public and private marinas and boating
9 facilities, recreational facilities and habitat areas; other major coastal states have maintenance
10 dredging policies and in-water maintenance dredge disposal sites; as a result of the lack of a general
11 maintenance dredging policy and program and as a result there has been:
12 (1) A decrease in the depth of the Providence Channel from forty-four (44) feet in 1971 to
13 twenty-four (24) feet in 1996;
14 (2) Navigational restrictions on ocean going vessels through the state’s waterways and
15 channels; and
16 (3) A decrease in the number of available slips and moorings at marinas throughout the
17 state; and the lack of a maintenance dredging policy and programs have significant adverse
18 environmental and economic effects on the state and therefore it is in the best interest of the state,
19 the cities and towns of the state, and the citizens thereof for the state to have a general maintenance
20 dredging policy and programs to resolve issues related to dredge maintenance and disposal and
21 avoid future significant direct and indirect adverse impact on the environment and economy of the
22 state.
23 (e) The department of coastal resources management council is hereby designated as the
24 lead state agency for purposes of dredging in tidal waters and as such shall have the following
25 duties and responsibilities:
26 (1) To coordinate the interest of the state with regard to dredging;
27 (2) To formulate and adopt a state policy with regard to dredging which integrates those
28 interests;
29 (3) To cooperate with, negotiate, and to enter into agreements on behalf of the state with
30 the federal government and with other public bodies and private parties with regard to dredging;
31 (4) To act as the initial and primary point of contact for all applications to the state for
32 dredging projects in tidal waters;
33 (5) To develop, prepare, adopt pursuant to § 46-23-11, implement, and maintain a
34 comprehensive plan for dredge material management; and
LC001019 - Page 3 of 34
1 (6) To cooperate and coordinate with the departments of environmental management,
2 transportation, administration, and health, and the economic development corporation in the
3 conduct of these duties and responsibilities.
4 (f)(1) The legislature recognizes that under Article I, § 17, the submerged lands of the state
5 are impressed with a public trust and that the state is responsible for the protection of the public’s
6 interest in these lands. The state maintains title in fee to all soil within its boundaries that lies below
7 the high water mark, and it holds that land in trust for the use of the public. In benefiting the public,
8 the state preserves certain public rights which include, but are not limited to, fishery, commerce,
9 and navigation in these waters and the submerged lands that they cover.
10 (2) Since All the powers and duties previously vested in the coastal resources management
11 council since its establishment in 1971, are hereby transferred to the department of coastal resources
12 ("department"). the CRMC The department has had the authority to manage and plan for the
13 preservation of the coastal resources of the state including, but not limited to, submerged lands.
14 The legislature hereby declares that, in light of the unique size, scope, and overall potential impact
15 upon the environment of large scale filling projects involving twenty-five (25) acres or more, any
16 lease of tidal lands, or any license to use those lands, is subject to approval, disapproval, or
17 conditional approval by the direct enactment of the general assembly by legislative action. The
18 CRMC department shall review all requests for leases, licenses to use the land, and other authority
19 to use the land made by any applicant prior to presentation of the request to the general assembly,
20 and the CRMC department shall make recommendations on the request to the general assembly.
21 With the exception of any and all projects to fill land of twenty-five (25) acres or more, the general
22 assembly hereby recognizes and declares that the CRMC department is delegated the sole and
23 exclusive authority for the leasing of submerged and filled lands and giving licenses for the use of
24 that land. Accordingly, the CRMC department will develop, coordinate, and adopt a system for the
25 leasing of submerged and filled lands, and licenses for the use of that land, and will ensure that all
26 leases and licenses are consistent with the public trust. Pursuant thereto, the CRMC department
27 shall impose a maximum fee of eighty thousand dollars ($80,000) per annum for any transatlantic
28 cable that makes landfall in Rhode Island. All such fees collected shall be deposited into the Bays,
29 Rivers and Watersheds Fund, established pursuant to § 46-31-12.1, and shall be disbursed
30 according to the purposes of that fund. Nothing contained in this subsection negates, repeals, or
31 alters the provisions, processes, and requirements for the leasing of submerged land for the conduct
32 of aquaculture as set out under chapter 10 of title 20. Therefore, nothing in this chapter shall be
33 construed to limit or impair the authority of the state, or any duly established agency of the state,
34 to regulate filling or dredging affecting tidal lands owned by the state or any other entity, and
LC001019 - Page 4 of 34
1 nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit or impair the obligation of the applicant to obtain
2 all applicable regulatory approvals. Specifically, and without limiting the foregoing, nothing in this
3 subsection negates, repeals, or alters the provisions, processes, and requirements for water quality
4 certification contained in chapter 12 of this title.

11 upon tidal flats, beaches, or along shore objects that indicates the intersection of the land with the
12 water’s surface level at the maximum height reached by a rising tide. The recognizable high tide
13 line may be determined by a line of seaweed, oil or scum along shore objects, a more or less
14 continuous deposit of fine shell or debris on the foreshore or berm, other physical markings or
15 characteristics, or other suitable means that delineate the general height reached by the water’s
16 surface level at a rising tide. If there is more than one line of seaweed, oil, scum, fine shell, or
17 debris, then the recognizable high tide line means the most seaward line. In the absence of residue
18 seaweed or other evidence, the recognizable high tide line means the wet line on a sandy or rocky
19 beach. The line encompasses the water’s surface level at spring high tides and other high tides that
20 occur with periodic frequency, but does not include the water’s surface level at storm surges in
21 which there is a departure from the normal or predicted reach of the water’s surface level due to
22 the piling up of water against a coast by strong winds, such as those accompanying a hurricane or
23 other intense storms.
24 (c) Notwithstanding any provision of the general laws to the contrary, the public’s rights
25 and privileges of the shore may be exercised, where shore exists, on wet sand or dry sand or rocky
26 beach, up to ten feet (10′) landward of the recognizable high tide line; provided, however, that the
27 public’s rights and privileges of the shore shall not be afforded where no passable shore exists, nor
28 on land above the vegetation line, or on lawns, rocky cliffs, sea walls, or other legally constructed
29 shoreline infrastructure. Further, no entitlement is hereby created for the public to use amenities
30 privately owned by other persons or entities, including, but not limited to: cabanas, decks, and
31 beach chairs.
32 (d) Any landowner whose property abuts the shore shall, with respect to the public’s
33 exercise of rights and privileges of the shore as defined in this chapter, be afforded the liability
34 limitations pursuant to chapter 6 of title 32.
LC001019 - Page 30 of 34

12 the General Laws in Chapter 46-23 entitled "Coastal Resources Management Council" are hereby
13 amended to read as follows:
14 46-23-1. Legislative findings.
15 (a)(1) Under article 1, § 17 of the Rhode Island Constitution, the people shall continue to
16 enjoy and freely exercise all the rights of fishery, and the privileges of the shore, to which they
17 have been heretofore entitled under the charter and usages of this state, including, but not limited
18 to, fishing from the shore, the gathering of seaweed, leaving the shore to swim in the sea and

1 passage along the shore; and they shall be secure in their rights to use and enjoyment of the natural
2 resources of the state with due regard for the preservation of their values; and it is the duty of the
3 general assembly to provide for the conservation of the air, land, water, plant, animal, mineral and
4 other natural resources of the state, and to adopt all means necessary and proper by law to protect
5 the natural environment of the people of the state by providing adequate resource planning for the
6 control and regulation of the use of the natural resources of the state and for the preservation,
7 regeneration, and restoration of the natural environment of the state.
8 (2) The general assembly recognizes and declares that the coastal resources of Rhode
9 Island, a rich variety of natural, commercial, industrial, recreational, and aesthetic assets, are of
10 immediate and potential value to the present and future development of this state; that unplanned
11 or poorly planned development of this basic natural environment has already damaged or destroyed,
12 or has the potential of damaging or destroying, the state’s coastal resources, and has restricted the
13 most efficient and beneficial utilization of these resources; that it shall be the policy of this state to
14 preserve, protect, develop, and, where possible, restore the coastal resources of the state for this
15 and succeeding generations through comprehensive and coordinated long range planning and
16 management designed to produce the maximum benefit for society from these coastal resources;
17 and that preservation and restoration of ecological systems shall be the primary guiding principle
18 upon which environmental alteration of coastal resources will be measured, judged, and regulated.
19 (b)(1) That effective implementation of these policies is essential to the social and
20 economic well-being of the people of Rhode Island because the sea and its adjacent lands are major
21 sources of food and public recreation, because these resources are used by and for industry,
22 transportation, waste disposal, and other purposes, and because the demands made on these
23 resources are increasing in number, magnitude, and complexity; and that these policies are
24 necessary to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare. Pursuant to 16 U.S.C. § 1452
25 (“The Coastal Zone Management Act”), the general assembly hereby directs the council department
26 of coastal resources (referred to as “CRMC” the "department") to exercise effectively its
27 responsibilities in the coastal zone through the development and implementation of management
28 programs to achieve wise use of the land and water resources of the coastal zone.
29 (2) Furthermore, that implementation of these policies is necessary in order to secure the
30 rights of the people of Rhode Island to the use and enjoyment of the natural resources of the state
31 with due regard for the preservation of their values, and in order to allow the general assembly to
32 fulfill its duty to provide for the conservation of the air, land, water, plant, animal, mineral, and
33 other natural resources of the state, and to adopt all means necessary and proper by law to protect
34 the natural environment of the people of the state by providing adequate resource planning for the
LC001019 - Page 2 of 34

1 control and regulation of the use of the natural resources of the state and for the preservation,
2 regeneration, and restoration of the natural environment of the state.
3 (c) That these policies can best be achieved through the creation of a coastal resources
4 management council department of coastal resources as the principal mechanism for management
5 of the state’s coastal resources.
6 (d) The general assembly recognizes and declares that maintenance dredging is required to
7 remove natural silt accumulations; Rhode Island has not had a general maintenance dredging policy
8 and programs for ports, port facilities, channels, harbors, public and private marinas and boating
9 facilities, recreational facilities and habitat areas; other major coastal states have maintenance
10 dredging policies and in-water maintenance dredge disposal sites; as a result of the lack of a general
11 maintenance dredging policy and program and as a result there has been:
12 (1) A decrease in the depth of the Providence Channel from forty-four (44) feet in 1971 to
13 twenty-four (24) feet in 1996;
14 (2) Navigational restrictions on ocean going vessels through the state’s waterways and
15 channels; and
16 (3) A decrease in the number of available slips and moorings at marinas throughout the
17 state; and the lack of a maintenance dredging policy and programs have significant adverse
18 environmental and economic effects on the state and therefore it is in the best interest of the state,
19 the cities and towns of the state, and the citizens thereof for the state to have a general maintenance
20 dredging policy and programs to resolve issues related to dredge maintenance and disposal and
21 avoid future significant direct and indirect adverse impact on the environment and economy of the
22 state.
23 (e) The department of coastal resources management council is hereby designated as the
24 lead state agency for purposes of dredging in tidal waters and as such shall have the following
25 duties and responsibilities:
26 (1) To coordinate the interest of the state with regard to dredging;
27 (2) To formulate and adopt a state policy with regard to dredging which integrates those
28 interests;
29 (3) To cooperate with, negotiate, and to enter into agreements on behalf of the state with
30 the federal government and with other public bodies and private parties with regard to dredging;
31 (4) To act as the initial and primary point of contact for all applications to the state for
32 dredging projects in tidal waters;
33 (5) To develop, prepare, adopt pursuant to § 46-23-11, implement, and maintain a
34 comprehensive plan for dredge material management; and
LC001019 - Page 3 of 34

1 (6) To cooperate and coordinate with the departments of environmental management,
2 transportation, administration, and health, and the economic development corporation in the
3 conduct of these duties and responsibilities.
4 (f)(1) The legislature recognizes that under Article I, § 17, the submerged lands of the state
5 are impressed with a public trust and that the state is responsible for the protection of the public’s
6 interest in these lands. The state maintains title in fee to all soil within its boundaries that lies below
7 the high water mark, and it holds that land in trust for the use of the public. In benefiting the public,
8 the state preserves certain public rights which include, but are not limited to, fishery, commerce,
9 and navigation in these waters and the submerged lands that they cover.
10 (2) Since All the powers and duties previously vested in the coastal resources management
11 council since its establishment in 1971, are hereby transferred to the department of coastal resources
12 ("department"). the CRMC The department has had the authority to manage and plan for the
13 preservation of the coastal resources of the state including, but not limited to, submerged lands.
14 The legislature hereby declares that, in light of the unique size, scope, and overall potential impact
15 upon the environment of large scale filling projects involving twenty-five (25) acres or more, any
16 lease of tidal lands, or any license to use those lands, is subject to approval, disapproval, or
17 conditional approval by the direct enactment of the general assembly by legislative action. The
18 CRMC department shall review all requests for leases, licenses to use the land, and other authority
19 to use the land made by any applicant prior to presentation of the request to the general assembly,
20 and the CRMC department shall make recommendations on the request to the general assembly.
21 With the exception of any and all projects to fill land of twenty-five (25) acres or more, the general
22 assembly hereby recognizes and declares that the CRMC department is delegated the sole and
23 exclusive authority for the leasing of submerged and filled lands and giving licenses for the use of
24 that land. Accordingly, the CRMC department will develop, coordinate, and adopt a system for the
25 leasing of submerged and filled lands, and licenses for the use of that land, and will ensure that all
26 leases and licenses are consistent with the public trust. Pursuant thereto, the CRMC department
27 shall impose a maximum fee of eighty thousand dollars ($80,000) per annum for any transatlantic
28 cable that makes landfall in Rhode Island. All such fees collected shall be deposited into the Bays,
29 Rivers and Watersheds Fund, established pursuant to § 46-31-12.1, and shall be disbursed
30 according to the purposes of that fund. Nothing contained in this subsection negates, repeals, or
31 alters the provisions, processes, and requirements for the leasing of submerged land for the conduct
32 of aquaculture as set out under chapter 10 of title 20. Therefore, nothing in this chapter shall be
33 construed to limit or impair the authority of the state, or any duly established agency of the state,
34 to regulate filling or dredging affecting tidal lands owned by the state or any other entity, and
LC001019 - Page 4 of 34

1 nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit or impair the obligation of the applicant to obtain
2 all applicable regulatory approvals. Specifically, and without limiting the foregoing, nothing in this
3 subsection negates, repeals, or alters the provisions, processes, and requirements for water quality
4 certification contained in chapter 12 of this title.
5 (3) Definitions. As used in this chapter, the following words unless the context clearly
6 requires otherwise, shall have the following meanings:
7 (i) "Department" means the department of coastal resources as established herein.
8 (ii) "Director" means the director of the department of coastal resources as established
9 herein, or their duly authorized agent, unless stated otherwise.
10 (i)(iii) “Filled land” means portions of tidal lands which have been rendered by the acts of
11 man to be no longer subject to tidal action or beneath tidal waters.
12 (ii)(iv) “Tidal Lands” means those lands that are below the mean high water.
13 (iii)(v) “Mean high water” means a line of contour representing the 18.6 year average as
14 determined by the metonic cycle and/or its equivalent as evidenced by the records, tidal datum, and
15 methodology of the United States Coastal Geodetic Survey within the National Oceanic and
16 Atmospheric Administration.

8 (a) The public’s rights and privileges of the shore are established by Article I, Sections 16
9 and 17 of the Rhode Island Constitution.
10 (b) For purposes of this chapter, the “recognizable high tide line” means a line or mark left
11 upon tidal flats, beaches, or along shore objects that indicates the intersection of the land with the
12 water’s surface level at the maximum height reached by a rising tide. The recognizable high tide
13 line may be determined by a line of seaweed, oil or scum along shore objects, a more or less
14 continuous deposit of fine shell or debris on the foreshore or berm, other physical markings or
15 characteristics, or other suitable means that delineate the general height reached by the water’s
16 surface level at a rising tide. If there is more than one line of seaweed, oil, scum, fine shell, or
17 debris, then the recognizable high tide line means the most seaward line. In the absence of residue
18 seaweed or other evidence, the recognizable high tide line means the wet line on a sandy or rocky
19 beach. The line encompasses the water’s surface level at spring high tides and other high tides that
20 occur with periodic frequency, but does not include the water’s surface level at storm surges in
21 which there is a departure from the normal or predicted reach of the water’s surface level due to
22 the piling up of water against a coast by strong winds, such as those accompanying a hurricane or
23 other intense storms.
