1 WHEREAS, When Joseph Pratt accepted the position to serve as the Executive Director
2 & Chief Executive Officer of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Newport County in 2014, the
3 organization had only five full-time staffers, a declining membership and a $250,000 deficit.
4 Thanks to Mr. Pratt's tireless work ethic and outstanding leadership, today the Club has a full-
5 time staff of 25, serves more than 2,000 members each year and has an operational budget of $3.5
6 million; and
7 WHEREAS, Under the astute leadership of Mr. Pratt, many important achievements and
8 milestones were accomplished, including steering the Boys & Girls Clubs of Newport County
9 (BGCNC) to become the first after-school childcare program on Aquidneck Island to achieve the
10 top 5-star rating from the educational system BrightStars; and
11 WHEREAS, Other significant achievements under Mr. Pratt's leadership included
12 diversifying the Club's business model by attaining more earned revenue, government revenue
13 and diversifying its philanthropic support. He also strengthened the Club's impact by serving
14 youths with stronger and more effective programs through evidence-based and informed
15 methodologies, building partnerships and working collaboratively with Working Cities, Reading
16 Reaps Rewards Summer Learning, forming school partnerships with Middletown High School,
17 the Met School and Rogers High School, and swim programs in both Newport and Middletown.
18 Mr. Pratt invested in his staff by raising compensation and adding benefits, such as a 401(k)

1 program and professional development opportunities, making Boys & Girls Clubs an attractive
2 career option. He also added staff roles for family outreach, SNAP nutritional assistance,
3 bilingual services, and significantly invested in facilities at three locations, Camp Grosvenor,
4 Central Clubhouse, and North End Clubhouse; and
5 WHEREAS, Joseph Pratt's extraordinary leadership was particularly evident during the
6 COVID-19 pandemic. Mr. Pratt skillfully and adroitly worked with the Rhode Island Department
7 of Human Services and the Rhode Island Department of Education by collaborating effectively
8 with regulatory agencies to protect and reopen the BGCNC summer camp. During this period of
9 crisis, Mr. Pratt managed operations prudently while always prioritizing families and children,
10 and skillfully navigating ever-changing regulatory guidelines and restrictions; and
11 WHEREAS, Thanks to Joseph Pratt's dedicated efforts, the Club has already raised close
12 to $15 million to expand and restore the Central Clubhouse. This expansion will allow the Club to
13 serve more young people, increase its impact within the greater Newport community, and foster
14 further growth and outreach; and
15 WHEREAS, In recognition of his outstanding work as the leader of the Boys & Girls
16 Clubs of Newport County, Joseph Pratt was appointed to the National Planning Commission of
17 the Boys & Girls Clubs of America (BGCA) and served on the National Advisory Committee to
18 the BGCA's CEO. Mr. Pratt also served as the Chair of the Greater Newport Chamber of
19 Commerce in 2022 and 2023; now, therefore be it
20 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
21 congratulates Mr. Joseph Pratt on his retirement as the Executive Director & Chief Executive
22 Officer of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Newport County and thanks him for all the good work he
