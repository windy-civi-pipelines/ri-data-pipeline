11 comparisons;

32 employer markets on premiums charged to individuals and small-employer groups.

19 and benefits information;
20 (v) Recommend a standard or common process to protect all providers from the costs of
21 services to patients who are ineligible for insurance coverage in circumstances where a payor

1 common-standards body or process exists and multiple conflicting sources are in use by payors and
2 providers.
3 (vi) Nothing in this section, nor in the guidelines developed, shall inhibit an individual
4 payor’s ability to employ, and not disclose to providers, temporary code edits for the purpose of

30 authorization requirements, based on stratification of healthcare providers’ performance and

32 provider organizations. Such criteria shall be transparent and easily accessible to contracted
33 providers. Such selective prior authorization programs shall be available when healthcare providers
34 participate directly with the insurer in risk-based payment contracts and may be available to
LC000194 - Page 8 of 15

20 (viii) Increase and strengthen continuity of patient care by:
21 (A) Defining protections for continuity of care during a transition period for patients
22 undergoing an active course of treatment, when there is a formulary or treatment coverage change
