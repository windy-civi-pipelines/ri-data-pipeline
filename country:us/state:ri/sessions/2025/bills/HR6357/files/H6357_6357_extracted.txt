HONORING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF TEMPLE EMANU-EL
McNamara, Finkelman, Boylan, Corvese, and Solomon
Date Introduced: May 22, 2025
Referred To: House read and passed
1 WHEREAS, On June 14, 1924, Temple Emanu-El was founded with the purpose of
2 “maintaining under free American institutions a house of worship for men, women, and children
3 of the Hebrew faith, dedicated to God, to the traditions and ideals of Judaism, and to the spiritual,
4 moral, and general welfare of its members, their families and the communities of which it shall be
5 a part”; and
6 WHEREAS, During the summer of 1924, the construction of the Temple’s building
7 layout had been formed and the Temple’s constitution was drafted, and with the successful efforts
8 to raise donations to purchase land and build the synagogue, construction soon began in 1925, on
9 the corner of Morris Street and Sessions Street, on a plot of land formerly part of Brown
10 University’s Botanical Gardens. In January of 1926, two additional lots on Taft Avenue were
11 acquired and ground was broken on May 23rd; and
12 WHEREAS, By September of 1926, a cantor had been hired, Israel Goldman returned as
13 Rabbi to lead services, and although not quite completed, the congregation held its first services
14 in the building. By 1927, a full staff was hired and on September 18, 1927, Temple Emanu-El
15 was officially opened under the welcoming entablature above the main entrance inscribed with
16 “its ringing summons: Seek ye the Lord and live”; and
17 WHEREAS, The Great Depression soon brought economic challenges to the Temple,
18 reducing funds available for programs, reductions followed by the elimination of the choir, pay
19 reductions for all staff, and a call for volunteers and donations in order to continue weekly
20 services; and
1 WHEREAS, In 1935, a tenth-year anniversary celebration of Temple Emanu-El’s
2 founding was held with a service for the first group of Bat Mitzvah girls, a program with a noted
3 historian, a historical pageant, a religious school reunion, and a dedication of a Sefer Torah; and
4 WHEREAS, Over the last 100 years, Temple Emanu-El has been “a center of Jewish life
5 in the historic East Side of Providence, Rhode Island” with educational programs, and social and
6 cultural activities, as well as myriad ways and opportunities to engage in worship; and
7 WHEREAS, On May 18, 2025, Temple Emanu-El will hold a Centennial Gala
8 celebrating “100 years, Countless Blessings”; now, therefore be it
9 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
10 celebrates the centennial celebration of Temple Emanu-El’s founding and recognizes and
11 commends the Temple’s efforts as a valued and productive partner in contributing to the well-
12 being of its congregants and the local community; and be it further
13 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
14 transmit a duly certified copy of this resolution to Pam Kaitin-Miller, Temple Emanu-El
15 President.
