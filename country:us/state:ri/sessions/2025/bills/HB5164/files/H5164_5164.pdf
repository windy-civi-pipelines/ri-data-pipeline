RELATING TO EDUCATION -- CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES
Introduced By: Representatives Carson, Shallcross Smith, McNamara, Cotter, Donovan,
Caldwell, Noret, Diaz, and Casimiro
Date Introduced: January 24, 2025
Referred To: House Education
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Findings of fact.
2 The General Assembly hereby finds and declares the following:
3 (l) Rhode Island is committed to delivering high-quality services to support positive early
4 childhood development and learning of children with developmental delays and disabilities under
5 Part C and Part B, Section 619 of the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ("IDEA"),
6 20 U.S.C. S 1400 et seq., from infancy to kindergarten entry.
7 (2) Early identification and delivery of high-quality early childhood IDEA services to
8 children with developmental challenges, developmental delays, and disabilities can improve
9 educational outcomes, reduce long-term costs of special education, and maximize the long-term
10 potential of children succeeding in school and life.
11 (3) Nationally, young children with disabilities and delays and their families face
12 challenges with accessing inclusive early childhood services individualized to their needs in all
13 settings, particularly young children of color.
14 (4) Effective early childhood IDEA services can help children make substantial
15 developmental progress. Research has shown that about one-third of children who receive timely
16 Early Intervention services no longer had a developmental delay or special education need in
17 kindergarten.
18 (5) The Rhode Island Early Intervention program established pursuant to § 23-13-23,
19 currently managed by the R.I. Executive Office of Health and Human Services, is the state's

1 comprehensive, coordinated, multidisciplinary, interagency system that provides early intervention
2 services for infants and toddlers with developmental delays and disabilities and their families, as
3 described and partially funded through Part C of the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education
4 Act.
5 (6) In Rhode Island, after twenty (20) years without a Medicaid rate increase, Early
6 Intervention financing and staffing challenges became so severe that in November 2021 the state
7 established a waiting list for Early Intervention services. As of January 2025, even after two
8 Medicaid rate increases, the Early Intervention program was still not fully staffed and there were
9 283 infants and toddlers who had been waiting for an Early Intervention evaluation for more than
10 45 days.
11 (7) The Rhode Island Department of Elementary and Secondary Education oversees the
12 state's early childhood special education services providing free, appropriate, public education to
13 all eligible children ages three (3) to five (5) with developmental delays and disabilities, partially
14 funded through a preschool formula grant under Part B, Section 619 of IDEA.
15 (8) In Rhode Island in 2022-2023, school districts completed developmental screenings for
16 only thirty-six percent (36%) of children ages three (3) to kindergarten entry. More than one-third
17 (1/3) of children ages three (3) to kindergarten entry who were referred to a school district with
18 developmental concerns were not evaluated to determine eligibility for special education.
19 (9) There is significant variation by school district in the percentage of children ages three
20 (3) to kindergarten entry who receive their early childhood special education services in a general
21 early childhood class. For example, ninety-five percent (95%) of children in East Greenwich
22 received their IEP services in an inclusive setting as of June 2023 compared to only thirty-eight
23 percent (38%) of children in the city of Providence.
24 (10) In March 2023, school districts in Rhode Island, particularly Providence Public
25 Schools, began reporting significant staffing challenges that were causing delays and disruptions
26 in delivering early childhood IDEA services to children ages three (3) to kindergarten entry.
27 SECTION 2. Chapter 16-24 of the General Laws entitled "Children With Disabilities [See
28 Title 16 Chapter 97 — The Rhode Island Board of Education Act]" is hereby amended by adding
29 thereto the following section:
30 16-24-20. Early childhood IDEA services task force established.
31 (a) As used in this section, the term "IDEA" refers to the Individuals with Disabilities
32 Education Act, as amended, 20 U.S.C. §1400 et seq.

22 and senate finance and education committees, which shall include recommendations to stabilize
23 and improve young children's access to early childhood IDEA services in the state. The

17 who need follow-up IDEA eligibility evaluations are monitored;
18 (7) Strategies to ensure children receive early childhood IDEA services in natural

20 education settings chosen by families for children from infancy to kindergarten entry, which may
