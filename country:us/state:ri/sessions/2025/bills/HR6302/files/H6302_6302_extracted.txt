3 Older Americans Month in 1965; and
4 WHEREAS, When Older Americans Month was established, 17 million Americans were
5 65 and older, with approximately a third living in poverty. Today, more than 62 million
6 Americans are aged 65 and older and constitute 18 percent of the population with a projected
7 increase to 23 percent by 2054. The poverty rate amongst older Americans has increased from 9
8 percent in 2020 to 10.9 percent in 2022; and
