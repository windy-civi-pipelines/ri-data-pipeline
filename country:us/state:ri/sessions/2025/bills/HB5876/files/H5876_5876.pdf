12 appointed by the secretary of state in consultation with the governor.
13 (c) The application to serve on the special commission shall include:
14 (1) The intent of the applicant to advance the investigation established by this section;
15 (2) The city or town in which the applicant resides;
16 (3) The employment or retirement status of the applicant; and
17 (4) The applicant's interest in serving on the commission and their view of why they might
18 make an important contribution to the work of the commission.
19 (d) The governor shall post the appointment opportunity on the official website of the state

1 within thirty (30) days of the passage of this section, and all applications for service on the
2 commission shall be submitted within thirty (30) days of the posting of the appointment
3 opportunity. All appointments to the commission shall be made no sooner than ninety (90) days
4 nor later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the passage of this act.
5 (e) The purpose of the special legislative commission shall be to investigate and report on
6 what measures may be necessary and appropriate to protect the environment, wildlife, culture, and
7 population of Rhode Island from the existential threat posed by nuclear weapons and to contribute
8 toward the total elimination of these weapons under multi-lateral negotiation per the auspices of
9 the 1970 Non-Proliferation Treaty; the 2010 New Start Treaty; and the 2021 Treaty on the
10 Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons as provided for in Article 4 of said treaty. Topics to be addressed
11 by the commission shall include, but not be limited to, the harms posed to Rhode Island by nuclear
12 weapons such as:
13 (1) Physical destruction from explosions, fire, and radioactive contamination;
14 (2) Infrastructure collapse including roads, bridges, electricity, and telecommunication;
15 (3) Disruption of essential services such as food and fuel supply, financial systems,
16 healthcare services, and housing;
17 (4) Environmental devastation, including the loss of natural resources, ecosystems, and
18 biodiversity;
19 (5) Severe harm to the physical and mental well-being of Rhode Island residents; and
20 (6) Severe disruptions to Rhode Island from a nuclear attack on a nearby city or state (i.e.,
21 New York or Boston) including radiation poisoning to organisms and water supplies, electrical
22 blackouts, food supply interruptions, etc.
23 (e)(1) The commission's deliberations shall also touch on the probable inability of
24 preventing the single, first use of a nuclear weapon from escalating into full-scale war; and the
25 scientifically validated danger of a years-long "nuclear winter" which would follow such a war and
26 would limit the growth of crops and lead to widespread human starvation.
27 (2) The commission shall also investigate measures and make recommendations to the
28 government and people of Rhode Island including, but not limited to, financial, legislative, or legal
29 measures to assist or encourage transition from nuclear weapons-related employment and
30 commercial activities within the state to jobs and activities that instead addresses the climate crisis
31 and other pressing social needs such as health care, housing, education, and elimination of poverty
32 and discrimination.
33 (f) No later than thirty (30) days after appointment of the final member of the commission,
34 the members shall meet and organize and shall elect co-chairpersons by majority vote. The

2 Island senate. The commission's proceedings, meetings, and activities shall be subject to chapter
3 46 of title 42. ("open meetings").
4 (g) The commission shall meet on a regular basis to research, gather evidence, and hear
5 testimony and advice in the manner that the members of the commission determine is the most
6 suitable for achieving its purpose. The commission shall hold at least five (5) public hearings across
7 the state to gather public input and inform citizens and legislators about the humanitarian and
8 environmental consequences of nuclear weapons use. These hearings shall address the potential
9 impact of a nuclear explosion on Providence or Quonset Point, including direct destruction,
10 radioactive fallout downwind, and long-term contamination. They shall also examine any potential
11 diplomatic breakthroughs such as entry into force of the Treaty on the A Prohibition of Nuclear
12 Weapons or other international diplomatic agreements aimed at reducing the threat of nuclear war.
13 The topics of employment, technologies, and industries within the state devoted to both nuclear
14 weapons and climate change shall be addressed. All members of the Rhode Island public shall be
15 given a reasonable opportunity to offer their views and ideas related to the subjects under
16 examination by the commission.
17 (h) If vacancies occur in the commission, the secretary of state shall fill them after
18 accepting applications as in the original appointments.
19 (i) The members of the special commission shall receive no compensation for their
20 services. The commission shall use state-owned public halls for the hearing venues without
21 necessity of payments. All departments and agencies of the state shall furnish such advice and
22 information, documentary and otherwise, to the commission and its agents as is deemed necessary
23 by the commission to facilitate the purpose of this section. The joint committee on legislative
24 services is hereby authorized and directed to provide suitable quarters for said commission.
25 (j) The commission shall report its findings and, if applicable, drafts of legislation to
26 implement them to the general assembly, governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, attorney
27 general, and all members of the Rhode Island congressional legislation, as well as to the press and
