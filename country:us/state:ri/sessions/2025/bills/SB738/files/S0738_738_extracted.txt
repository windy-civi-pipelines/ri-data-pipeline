14 recollection.
15 (b) The written verification provided to the lessor or owner, including the fact that an
16 individual is a victim of abuse, domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking, shall be maintained
17 in strict confidence. The lessor or owner shall keep this information and any further personally-
18 identifiable information of tenant and tenant’s household members (such as address, social security
19 number, email, phone number, birthdate) confidential and shall not disclose this information to any
20 other entity, party or individual, except to the extent that such disclosure is:

6 § 34-18-62 or based upon an applicant having requested a change of locks under § 34-18-64.
7 34-18-64. Change of locks upon request of tenant, co-tenant, or household member
8 believed to be under imminent threat of abuse, domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking.
9 (a) For purposes of this section, the term “household member” shall mean a person residing
10 with the tenant or co-tenant as an authorized occupant of the premises, and who is eighteen (18)
11 years of age or older or an emancipated minor.
12 (b) A lessor or owner shall, upon the request of a tenant, co-tenant or a household member,
13 change the locks of the individual dwelling unit in which the tenant, co-tenant or household member
14 lives if the tenant, co-tenant or household member reasonably believes that the tenant, co-tenant or
15 household member is under an imminent threat of abuse, domestic violence, sexual assault or
16 stalking at the premises. A lessor or owner shall have the right to request, in good faith, written
17 verification or self-certification of the status as a victim of abuse, domestic violence, sexual assault
18 or stalking, as provided in § 34-18-62.
19 (c) If the threat of abuse, domestic abuse, violence, sexual assault or stalking is posed by a
20 person who is a tenant, co-tenant or household member, the lessor or owner may change the locks
21 and deny a key to the alleged perpetrator upon receipt of a request to change the locks; provided,
22 however, that such request shall be accompanied by:
23 (1) A copy of a valid protective order issued against a tenant, co-tenant or household
24 member; or
25 (2) A record from a federal, state or local court or law enforcement, indicating that a tenant,
26 co-tenant or household member thereof poses an imminent threat of abuse, domestic violence,
27 sexual assault or stalking.
28 (d) A lessor or owner who has received notice of a request for change of locks under this
29 section shall, within two (2) business days, make a good faith effort to change the locks or give the
30 tenant, co-tenant or household member permission to change the locks. If the lessor or owner
31 changes the locks, the lessor or owner shall make a good faith effort to give a key to the new locks
32 to the tenant, co-tenant or household member requesting the lock change as soon as possible, but
33 within the same two (2) business day period. A lessor or owner may charge a fee for the expense
34 of changing the locks. The fee shall not exceed the reasonable price customarily charged for
LC002246 - Page 6 of 9
1 changing such locks in that community.
2 (e) If a lessor or owner fails to change the locks after receipt of a request under this section
3 within two (2) business days, the tenant, co-tenant or household member may change the locks
4 without the owner’s permission. If the rental agreement requires that the lessor or owner retain a
5 key to the leased residential premises and if a tenant, co-tenant or household member changes the
6 locks, the tenant, co-tenant or household member shall make a good faith effort to provide a key to
7 the new locks to the lessor or owner within two (2) business days of the locks being changed. If a
8 tenant, co-tenant or household member changes the locks without the owner’s permission, such
9 person shall change the locks in a workmanlike manner with locks of similar or better quality than
10 the original locks. A lessor or owner may replace a lock installed by the tenant, co-tenant or
11 household member, or seek reimbursement for additional costs incurred, if the lessor or owner
12 believes that the locks were not of equal or better quality or were not installed properly, and such
13 action shall be deemed not to be in retaliation.
14 (f) If the locks are changed under this section, a tenant, co-tenant or household member
15 shall not voluntarily give the new key to the perpetrator. A lessor or owner who refuses to provide
16 a key to any person based on the reasonable belief that such person is the perpetrator of alleged
17 abuse, domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking, shall not be liable for such refusal.
18 (g) A lessor or owner who takes action to prevent the tenant, co-tenant or household
19 member who has complied with subsection (b) of this section from changing the locks, or any lessor
20 or owner who changes the locks but fails to make a good faith effort to provide a key to the tenant,
21 co-tenant or household member requesting the lock change as provided in subsection (d) of this
22 section, shall be liable for actual and consequential damages or three (3) months’ rent, whichever
23 is greater, and the costs of the action, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, all of which may be
24 applied in setoff or recoupment against any claim for rent owed or owing for use and occupancy.
25 Damages shall not be imposed if the court determines that the lessor or owner acted in good faith.
26 34-18-65. Jurisdiction of courts to restrain violations. Applicability of other laws to
27 requests to change locks.
28 (a) The district court shall have jurisdiction in equity to restrain violations of §§ 34-18-62
29 through 34-18-64, inclusive.
30 (b) Notwithstanding §§ 34-18-62 through 34-18-64, inclusive, if a court has issued a
31 protective order pursuant to § 15-5-19, chapter 15 of title 15, chapter 8.1 of title 8, § 12-29-4, or
32 any other law, ordering a tenant, co-tenant or household member to vacate the dwelling unit, the
33 lessor or owner shall not interfere with the order and upon a request to change the locks as described
34 in § 34-18-64, shall comply with such request.
LC002246 - Page 7 of 9

22 (a) A tenant may terminate their lease or rental agreement without penalty or fees for early
23 termination, or liability for future rent when:
24 (1) The tenant or household member within the most recent one hundred fifty (150) days

29 (3) This right to terminate the lease or rental agreement pursuant to this subsection shall
30 be conditioned on:
31 (i) The tenant or household member of a tenant who is the victim provides the lessor or
32 owner with written verification that the tenant or household member of a tenant has obtained a valid
33 protective order against the perpetrator of the abuse, domestic violence, sexual assault stalking; or

10 (D) Provides a written and signed self-certification that the tenant or household member
11 of a tenant was a victim of abuse, domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking; and
12 (iii) Language swearing that the facts provided by the tenant or household member of a
13 tenant in the self-certification statement are true and accurate to the best of their knowledge and
14 recollection.
15 (b) The written verification provided to the lessor or owner, including the fact that an
16 individual is a victim of abuse, domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking, shall be maintained
17 in strict confidence. The lessor or owner shall keep this information and any further personally-
18 identifiable information of tenant and tenant’s household members (such as address, social security
19 number, email, phone number, birthdate) confidential and shall not disclose this information to any
20 other entity, party or individual, except to the extent that such disclosure is:
21 (1) Requested and consented to in writing by the tenant or household member of the tenant
22 who is the victim of abuse, domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking; or
23 (2) Otherwise required by applicable law.
24 (c) The tenant who has given notice shall vacate the premises within thirty (30) days of
25 giving notice to the landlord or at any other time as may be agreed upon by the landlord and the
26 tenant.
27 (d) For the purposes of determining rent owed, a tenant who terminates a lease or rental
28 agreement pursuant to this section is only liable, if solely or jointly liable for purposes of the lease
29 or rental agreement, for rent owed through the date of termination or the date the tenant actually
30 vacates the premises, whichever is later.
31 (e) A tenant who terminates a lease or rental agreement pursuant to this section shall be
32 entitled to a refund of any security deposit or prepaid rent for any period thereafter. The tenant shall
33 receive a full and specific statement of the basis for retaining any of the security deposit or prepaid

LC002246 - Page 5 of 9

1 the conclusion of the tenancy.
2 34-18-63. Refusal of rental agreement or assistance based on termination of rental
3 agreement under § 34-18-62 or request for change of lock under § 34-18-64 prohibited.
4 A lessor or owner shall not refuse to enter into a rental agreement, nor shall a housing
5 subsidy provider deny assistance, based on an applicant having terminated a rental agreement under
6 § 34-18-62 or based upon an applicant having requested a change of locks under § 34-18-64.
7 34-18-64. Change of locks upon request of tenant, co-tenant, or household member
8 believed to be under imminent threat of abuse, domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking.
9 (a) For purposes of this section, the term “household member” shall mean a person residing
10 with the tenant or co-tenant as an authorized occupant of the premises, and who is eighteen (18)
11 years of age or older or an emancipated minor.
12 (b) A lessor or owner shall, upon the request of a tenant, co-tenant or a household member,
13 change the locks of the individual dwelling unit in which the tenant, co-tenant or household member
14 lives if the tenant, co-tenant or household member reasonably believes that the tenant, co-tenant or
15 household member is under an imminent threat of abuse, domestic violence, sexual assault or
16 stalking at the premises. A lessor or owner shall have the right to request, in good faith, written
17 verification or self-certification of the status as a victim of abuse, domestic violence, sexual assault
18 or stalking, as provided in § 34-18-62.
19 (c) If the threat of abuse, domestic abuse, violence, sexual assault or stalking is posed by a
20 person who is a tenant, co-tenant or household member, the lessor or owner may change the locks
21 and deny a key to the alleged perpetrator upon receipt of a request to change the locks; provided,
22 however, that such request shall be accompanied by:
23 (1) A copy of a valid protective order issued against a tenant, co-tenant or household
24 member; or
25 (2) A record from a federal, state or local court or law enforcement, indicating that a tenant,
26 co-tenant or household member thereof poses an imminent threat of abuse, domestic violence,
27 sexual assault or stalking.
28 (d) A lessor or owner who has received notice of a request for change of locks under this
29 section shall, within two (2) business days, make a good faith effort to change the locks or give the
30 tenant, co-tenant or household member permission to change the locks. If the lessor or owner
31 changes the locks, the lessor or owner shall make a good faith effort to give a key to the new locks
32 to the tenant, co-tenant or household member requesting the lock change as soon as possible, but
33 within the same two (2) business day period. A lessor or owner may charge a fee for the expense
34 of changing the locks. The fee shall not exceed the reasonable price customarily charged for
LC002246 - Page 6 of 9

1 changing such locks in that community.
2 (e) If a lessor or owner fails to change the locks after receipt of a request under this section
3 within two (2) business days, the tenant, co-tenant or household member may change the locks
4 without the owner’s permission. If the rental agreement requires that the lessor or owner retain a
5 key to the leased residential premises and if a tenant, co-tenant or household member changes the
6 locks, the tenant, co-tenant or household member shall make a good faith effort to provide a key to
7 the new locks to the lessor or owner within two (2) business days of the locks being changed. If a
8 tenant, co-tenant or household member changes the locks without the owner’s permission, such
9 person shall change the locks in a workmanlike manner with locks of similar or better quality than
10 the original locks. A lessor or owner may replace a lock installed by the tenant, co-tenant or
11 household member, or seek reimbursement for additional costs incurred, if the lessor or owner
12 believes that the locks were not of equal or better quality or were not installed properly, and such
13 action shall be deemed not to be in retaliation.
14 (f) If the locks are changed under this section, a tenant, co-tenant or household member
15 shall not voluntarily give the new key to the perpetrator. A lessor or owner who refuses to provide
16 a key to any person based on the reasonable belief that such person is the perpetrator of alleged
17 abuse, domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking, shall not be liable for such refusal.
18 (g) A lessor or owner who takes action to prevent the tenant, co-tenant or household
19 member who has complied with subsection (b) of this section from changing the locks, or any lessor
20 or owner who changes the locks but fails to make a good faith effort to provide a key to the tenant,
21 co-tenant or household member requesting the lock change as provided in subsection (d) of this
22 section, shall be liable for actual and consequential damages or three (3) months’ rent, whichever
23 is greater, and the costs of the action, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, all of which may be
24 applied in setoff or recoupment against any claim for rent owed or owing for use and occupancy.
25 Damages shall not be imposed if the court determines that the lessor or owner acted in good faith.
26 34-18-65. Jurisdiction of courts to restrain violations. Applicability of other laws to
27 requests to change locks.
28 (a) The district court shall have jurisdiction in equity to restrain violations of §§ 34-18-62
29 through 34-18-64, inclusive.
30 (b) Notwithstanding §§ 34-18-62 through 34-18-64, inclusive, if a court has issued a
31 protective order pursuant to § 15-5-19, chapter 15 of title 15, chapter 8.1 of title 8, § 12-29-4, or
32 any other law, ordering a tenant, co-tenant or household member to vacate the dwelling unit, the
33 lessor or owner shall not interfere with the order and upon a request to change the locks as described
34 in § 34-18-64, shall comply with such request.
LC002246 - Page 7 of 9

1 34-18-66. Waivers of §§ 34-18-62 through 34-18-64 void and unenforceable.
2 A waiver of §§ 34-18-62 through 34-18-64, inclusive, in any lease or other rental
3 agreement, except as otherwise provided by law or by federal, state or local regulation shall be void
4 and unenforceable.
