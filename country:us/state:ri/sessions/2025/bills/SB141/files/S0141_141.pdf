19 COMMON QUESTIONS ABOUT THE USE OF THIS FORM Q. What does the Transfer
20 on Death (TOD) deed do? A. When you die, this deed transfers the described property, subject to
21 any liens or mortgages (or other encumbrances) on the property at your death. Probate is not
22 required. The TOD deed has no effect until you die. You can revoke it at any time. You are also
23 free to transfer the property to someone else during your lifetime. If you do not own any interest in
24 the property when you die, this deed will have no effect. Q. How do I make a TOD deed? A.
25 Complete this form. Have it acknowledged before a notary public or other individual authorized by
26 law to take acknowledgments. Record the form in each city or town where any part of the property
27 is located. The form has no effect unless it is acknowledged and recorded before your death. Q. Is
28 the "legal description" of the property necessary? A. Yes. Q. How do I find the "legal description"
29 of the property? A. This information may be on the deed you received when you became an owner
30 of the property. This information may also be available in the office of the city or town recorder
31 where the property is located. If you are not absolutely sure, consult a lawyer. Q. Can I change my
32 mind before I record the TOD deed? A. Yes. If you have not yet recorded the deed and want to
33 change your mind, simply tear up or otherwise destroy the deed. Q. How do I "record" the TOD
34 deed? A. Take the completed and acknowledged form to the office of the city or town recorder
LC000252 - Page 6 of 10

1 where the property is located. Follow the instructions given by the city or town recorder to make
2 the form part of the official property records. If the property is in more than one city or town, you
3 should record the deed in each city or town. Q. Can I later revoke the TOD deed if I change my
4 mind? A. Yes. The TOD deed is revocable. No one, including the beneficiaries, can prevent you
5 from revoking the deed. Q. How do I revoke the TOD deed after it is recorded? A. There are three
6 (3) ways to revoke a recorded TOD deed: (1) Complete and acknowledge a revocation form, and
7 record it in each city or town where the property is located. (2) Complete and acknowledge a new
8 TOD deed that disposes of the same property, and record it in each city or town where the property
9 is located. (3) Transfer the property to someone else during your lifetime by a recorded deed that
10 expressly revokes the TOD deed. You may not revoke the TOD deed by will. Q. I am being
11 pressured to complete this form. What should I do? A. Do not complete this form under pressure.
12 Seek help from a trusted family member, a friend, or a lawyer. Q. Do I need to tell the beneficiaries
13 about the TOD deed? A. No, but it is recommended. Secrecy can cause later complications and
14 might make it easier for others to commit fraud. Q. If I sign a TOD deed and designate my two (2)
15 children as beneficiaries, and one of them dies before me, does the interest of my child that dies
16 before me pass to his or her children? A. No. Everything will go to your surviving child unless you
17 record a new transfer on death deed to state otherwise. If you have questions regarding how to word
18 a new transfer on death deed, you are encouraged to consult a lawyer. Q. I have other questions
19 about this form. What should I do? A. This form is designed to fit some but not all situations. If
20 you have other questions, you are encouraged to consult a lawyer.
