PROCLAIMING MAY OF 2025, TO BE "MOTORCYCLE AWARENESS MONTH" IN THE
STATE OF RHODE ISLAND
Introduced By: Representatives Bennett, Shekarchi, Blazejewski, Chippendale,
Quattrocchi, Paplauskas, Nardone, Solomon, Phillips, and Lima
Date Introduced: April 24, 2025
Referred To: House read and passed
1 WHEREAS, The Rhode Island Motorcycle Association was started in 1974 in West
2 Warwick, as a nonprofit motorcycle rights organization to protect the freedoms of riders in Rhode
3 Island through safety, education and legislation; and
4 WHEREAS, The Rhode Island Motorcycle Association has worked closely with
5 Governors, legislators and the Rhode Island Department of Transportation to advance the
6 freedom of choice and the safety of motorcycle riders in Rhode Island with fair and equitable
7 solutions; and
8 WHEREAS, The theme for "Motorcycle Safety Awareness Month" is "Share the Road:
9 It's Everyone's Responsibility." This theme emphasizes that everyone, including drivers and
10 motorcyclists, has an important role to play in ensuring safe roads The goal is to educate riders on
11 the importance of safe riding practices, defensive riding techniques and the need to wear
12 protective gear. The theme also urges all riders to obey traffic laws, to maintain their motorcycles
13 properly, to take motorcycle safety courses, to wear bright clothing and use lights to stay visible
14 to other motorists, to use defensive riding techniques, and urges care drivers to give motorcycles
15 ample space; and
16 WHEREAS, Motorcycle riding is an economical and popular form of transportation
17 enjoyed by about eight percent of the American people. It provides a more efficient mode of
18 transportation than cars or trucks, uses up fewer resources, causes less wear and tear on our roads
19 and highways, and increases available parking spaces; and

1 WHEREAS, Motorcycle accidents are unfortunately a common occurrence, with
2 estimates suggesting that such fatal incidents occur approximately once every twelve minutes in
3 America and account for more than 14 percent of all traffic fatalities, despite the fact that only 3
4 percent of all registered vehicles are motorcycles; and
5 WHEREAS, Because motorcycles donâ€™t have seat belts or airbags, and they are much
6 smaller than cars, motorcyclists are 28 times more likely to die in a crash than those driving cars;
7 and
8 WHEREAS, As of January 2023, the total number of public, personal, and commercial
9 motorcycles registered in the United States and the District of Columbia totaled approximately
10 8.8 million, with 32,252 registered in Rhode Island as of 2021; and
11 WHEREAS, Data reported by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
12 (NHTSA) states that in 2023, 6,218 motorcyclists died in traffic accidents in the United States,
13 which is around 17 motorcyclists killed per day; and
14 WHEREAS, Distracted driving poses one of the biggest dangers to other motorists,
15 especially motorcyclists. Distractions can be any activity that takes a driver's focus off the task of
16 driving, including eating and drinking, talking or texting on the phone, and numerous other
17 distractions, all of which pose serious dangers to the motorcycle driving public; and
18 WHEREAS, While there are no prescribed means to prevent motorcycle wrecks, greater
19 awareness of motorist safety and potential existing risks can arm riders with the knowledge they
20 need to help mitigate dangerous situations while on the road; now, therefore be it
21 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
22 proclaims May of 2025, to be "Motorcycle Awareness Month" in the State of Rhode Island, and
23 urges all motorists to avoid distracted driving; and be it further
24 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
25 transmit a duly certified copy of this resolution to the Rhode Island Motorcycle Association.
