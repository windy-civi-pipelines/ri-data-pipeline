1 WHEREAS, Saint Joseph, Holy Patriarch and Patron Saint of Workers, known by his
2 deeds, was a man of quiet courage and deep faith who was tested in Nazareth, Bethlehem, and

7 WHEREAS, Saint Joseph is celebrated by Christians around the world, from the tropical

15 WHEREAS, Italians and Italian-Americans celebrate the prevention of a Sicilian famine
16 in the Middle Ages as a miracle attributed to Saint Joseph; and

19 tempered by faith, of sacrifice for family, and of the glorious gift of honest labor; now, therefore
20 be it
