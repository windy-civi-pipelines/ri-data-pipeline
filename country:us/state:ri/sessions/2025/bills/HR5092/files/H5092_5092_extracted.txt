Introduced By: Representatives Craven, Shekarchi, Blazejewski, McEntee, Chippendale,
Kennedy, Fogarty, Serpa, Boylan, and Ackerman
Date Introduced: January 21, 2025
Referred To: House read and passed
1 WHEREAS, It is with sadness that this House has learned of the passing of Andrea Marie
2 Hopkins, the beloved wife of Mark Hopkins for fifty-six years, and the cherished mother of
3 Kathryn Hopkins (Fran Morey), and Jennifer Skerrett; and
4 WHEREAS, Born in the City of Providence, Mrs. Hopkins was the daughter of Maurice
5 and Regina Frechette, and the sister of Maurice Shrader-Frechette and his wife, Kristin, Maureen
6 Maggiacomo and her husband, Ron, Paul Frechette and his wife, Cher, Peter Frechette and David
7 Warren, and the sister-in-law of James Hopkins. She is also survived by many nieces and
8 nephews, and their families; and
9 WHEREAS, Mrs. Hopkins was a graduate of Coventry High School and was honored as
10 a member of the inaugural class of Coventry High School’s Hall of Fame. Continuing her
11 education, she earned a degree in Political Science from the University of Rhode Island. She had
12 been employed in Marketing for the A.T. Cross Co. and was the Senior Vice President of
13 Marketing and Member Services for AAA Southern New England before joining the staff at the
14 University of Rhode Island, where she retired in 2011 as Assistant Vice President of Public
15 Affairs; and
16 WHEREAS, With a loving personality, Mrs. Hopkins created and nurtured a marriage
17 that flourished and a home that was warm and welcoming. She was the provider of sumptuous
18 pies, desserts, pickles, relishes, jams and jellies that were legendary, and when her children, and
19 nieces and nephews were young, she would bake and decorate birthday cakes of their choosing.
1 She later doted on her grandchildren, Elizabeth Skerrett, Anna Skerrett, and Ian Morey, lovingly
2 handmaking them pajamas and their favorite cookies; and
3 WHEREAS, Throughout her life, Mrs. Hopkins was devoted to her Alma Mater for
4 which she had received the URI Ram Award. For more than fifty years, she and her husband were
5 basketball season ticket holders. She enthusiastically recruited and advocated for URI, both in the
6 community and lobbying for URI at the Rhode Island State House, where she would often invite
7 URI students to accompany her. She had also served as an Alumni Admissions Representative, a
8 trustee of the URI Foundation, a member of the Alumni Association Government Relations
9 Advisory Committee, and was a charter member of the Women’s Council for Development; and
10 WHEREAS, Active in the community, and always generous with her time and expertise,
11 Mrs. Hopkins served as a Trustee and Incorporator of Centerville Bank, as a Trustee of Kent
12 Hospital, a member of the Kent Hospital Foundation, Leadership Rhode Island, and the Coventry
13 Public Library Board of Trustees, and was on Senator Jack Reed’s Women’s Advisory
14 Committee, and was the former President of both the Coventry Public Library Foundation and the
15 Anthony Lyceum Library Association. For her dedication, she was honored with the Leadership
16 Rhode Island David Sweet Leadership Award, and most recently the Kent Hospital Foundation
17 2024 Philanthropist of the Year Award; and
18 WHEREAS, Andrea Hopkins was “a strong powerful woman” who “did nothing by
19 halves,” was always “a willing and eager mentor to anyone who could benefit from her expertise”
20 and who possessed a “How Can I Help” attitude. She was rarely one to remain idle, and
21 relentlessly fought Parkinson’s over the last two decades of her life with a commitment to
22 physical fitness, treatments, stubbornness, and persistence. Her determination and
23 accomplishments are inspirational, she enriched the lives of all who knew her, and she is truly
24 and dearly missed; now, therefore be
25 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
26 expresses deepest sympathies on the passing of Andrea Marie Hopkins; and be it further
27 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
28 transmit a duly certified copy of this resolution to Mark Hopkins and Family.
