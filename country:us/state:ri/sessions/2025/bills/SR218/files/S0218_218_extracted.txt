10 WHEREAS, In 1959, Mr. Egan was drafted into the United States Army. He was
11 assigned to the Missile Technician School at the Redstone Arsenal, U.S. Space and Technical
12 Center in Huntsville, Alabama, and was later assigned to serve at Fort Sill in Oklahoma. In all of

14 WHEREAS, Upon returning home from his military obligations, Mr. Egan began his
15 long and distinguished public service career in education when he accepted a position to be a
16 teacher in Bellingham, Massachusetts. After obtaining a Master’s degree in Counseling from
17 Rhode Island College, Mr. Egan worked with distinction and tireless devotion as a guidance
18 counselor and school administrator at both Coventry Middle School and Coventry High School,
19 retiring as an Assistant Principal. Mr. Egan was noted for his assertive, commanding presence
1 and booming voice which allowed him to command the behavior of a bunch of loud teenagers in
2 an auditorium. He was also beloved for the kindness and compassion he brought with him to
3 school every day. He made a positive difference in the lives of countless youngsters; and
4 WHEREAS, George Egan also had a long and successful career as an ice hockey coach,
5 at both Ponaganset and Coventry High Schools. He was twice named Hockey Coach of the Year

10 as the Rhode Island Interscholastic League Director of Hockey; and
11 WHEREAS, George Egan is a member of the Coventry High School Athletic Hall of
12 Fame, the Rhode Island Interscholastic League Hall of Fame, and was the recipient of the Frank
13 Lanning Achievement Award from the Rhode Island sports news organization Words Unlimited;
14 and
15 WHEREAS, As a youngster, Mr. Egan joined the Boy Scouts and spent every summer at
16 Camp Yawgoog. Passionate about the virtues of scouting, Mr. Egan devoted 25 years of his life
17 serving as an Adult Supervisor and Counselor for the Boy Scouts, serving on the camp’s staff,
18 and as the Medicine Bow Camp Director, where he was a beloved figure and earned the fond
19 nickname “the Great Pumpkin”. In recognition of the indelible mark Mr. Egan made in the hearts
20 and memories of so many Camp Yawgoog figures, when the camp launched its campaign to raise
21 funds for its 100th Anniversary, dozens of staff members joined together to raise $100,000,
22 marked by a commemorative monument at the camp’s central flagpole in honor of Mr. Egan’s
23 many years of dedication and service to Camp Yawgoog and the Boy Scouts; and
24 WHEREAS, Mr. Egan leaves behind his siblings Joanne E. Shea, Andrea E. Didden, and
25 her husband, Albert, Reverend Thomas F. Egan, and Jay A. Egan, his nephews and nieces,
26 Christopher Shea, Angie Shea, Andrea Shea Cirbee, Stephen Cirbee, Daniel Shea, Deborah Shea,
