31 jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings

24 other member states shall be revoked until all encumbrances have been removed from the home
25 state license. All home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against a licensee shall

27 the pendency of the order.
28 (i) Once an encumbered license in the home state is restored to an unencumbered license

31 remote state.
32 (j) If a member state takes adverse action, it shall promptly notify the administrator of the

11 discussed in a meeting and shall provide a full and accurate summary of actions taken, and the
12 reasons therefore, including a description of the views expressed. All documents considered in
13 connection with an action shall be identified in such minutes. All minutes and documents of a
14 closed meeting shall remain under seal, subject to release only by a majority vote of the compact
15 commission or order of a court of competent jurisdiction.
16 (g) Financing of the compact commission.
17 (1) The compact commission shall pay, or provide for the payment of, the reasonable
18 expenses of its establishment, organization, and ongoing activities.
19 (2) The compact commission may accept any and all appropriate revenue sources as
20 provided in subsection (c) of this section.
21 (3) The compact commission may levy on and collect an annual assessment from each
22 member state and impose fees on licensees of member states to whom it grants a compact privilege
23 to cover the cost of the operations and activities of the compact commission and its staff, which
24 must, in a total amount, be sufficient to cover its annual budget as approved each year for which
25 revenue is not provided by other sources. The aggregate annual assessment amount for member
26 states shall be allocated based upon a formula that the compact commission shall promulgate by
27 rule.
28 (4) The compact commission shall not incur obligations of any kind prior to securing the
29 funds adequate to meet the same; nor shall the compact commission pledge the credit of any of the
30 member states, except by and with the authority of the member state.
31 (5) The compact commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and
32 disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the compact commission shall be subject to the
33 financial review and accounting procedures established under its bylaws. However, all receipts and
34 disbursements of funds handled by the compact commission shall be subject to an annual financial
LC000769 - Page 13 of 23
1 review by a certified or licensed public accountant, and the report of the financial review shall be
2 included in and become part of the annual report of the compact commission.
3 (h) Qualified immunity, defense, and indemnification.
4 (1) The members, officers, executive director, employees and representatives of the
5 compact commission shall be immune from suit and liability, both personally and in their official
6 capacity, for any claim for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or other civil liability
7 caused by or arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred, or that the
8 person against whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the
9 scope of compact commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided that, nothing in
10 this section shall be construed to protect any such person from suit or liability for any damage, loss,
11 injury, or liability caused by the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of that person. The
12 procurement of insurance of any type by the compact commission shall not in any way compromise
13 or limit the immunity granted hereunder.
14 (2) The compact commission shall defend any member, officer, executive director,
15 employee, and representative of the compact commission in any civil action seeking to impose
16 liability arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope
17 of compact commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or as determined by the compact
18 commission that the person against whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis for believing
19 occurred within the scope of compact commission employment, duties, or responsibilities;
20 provided that, nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit that person from retaining their own
21 counsel at their own expense; and provided, further, that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission
22 did not result from that person's intentional or willful or wanton misconduct.
23 (3) The compact commission shall indemnify and hold harmless any member, officer,
24 executive director, employee, and representative of the compact commission for the amount of any
25 settlement or judgment obtained against that person arising out of any actual or alleged act, error,
26 or omission that occurred within the scope of compact commission employment, duties, or
27 responsibilities, or that such person had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope
28 of compact commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided that, the actual or alleged
29 act, error, or omission did not result from the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of that
30 person.
31 (4) Nothing herein shall be construed as a limitation on the liability of any licensee for
32 professional malpractice or misconduct, which shall be governed solely by any other applicable
33 state laws.
34 (5) Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted to waive or otherwise abrogate a member
LC000769 - Page 14 of 23
1 state's state action immunity or state action affirmative defense with respect to antitrust claims
2 under the Sherman Act, Clayton Act, or any other state or federal antitrust or anticompetitive law
3 or regulation.
4 (6) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to be a waiver of sovereign immunity by the
5 member states or by the compact commission.
6 5-64.2-10. Data system.
7 (a) The compact commission shall provide for the development, maintenance, operation,
8 and utilization of a coordinated data system.
9 (b) The compact commission shall assign each applicant for a compact privilege a unique
10 identifier, as determined by the rules.
11 (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of state law to the contrary, a member state shall
12 submit a uniform data set to the data system on all individuals to whom this compact is applicable
13 as required by the rules of the compact commission, including:
14 (1) Identifying information;
15 (2) Licensure data;
16 (3) Adverse actions against a license or compact privilege and information related thereto;
17 (4) Non-confidential information related to alternative program participation, the
18 beginning and ending dates of such participation, and other information related to such participation
19 not made confidential under member state law;
20 (5) Any denial of application for licensure, and the reason(s) for such denial;
21 (6) The presence of current significant investigative information; and
22 (7) Other information that may facilitate the administration of this chapter or the protection
23 of the public, as determined by the rules of the compact commission.
24 (d) The records and information provided to a member state pursuant to this chapter or
25 through the data system, when certified by the compact commission or an agent thereof, shall
26 constitute the authenticated business records of the compact commission, and shall be entitled to
27 any associated hearsay exception in any relevant judicial, quasi-judicial, or administrative
28 proceedings in a member state.
29 (e) Current significant investigative information pertaining to a licensee in any member
30 state will only be available to other member states.
31 (f) It is the responsibility of the member states to report any adverse action against a
32 licensee and to monitor the data system to determine whether any adverse action has been taken
33 against a licensee. Adverse action information pertaining to a licensee in any member state will be
34 available to any other member state.
LC000769 - Page 15 of 23
1 (g) Member states contributing information to the data system may designate information
2 that may not be shared with the public without the express permission of the contributing state.
3 (h) Any information submitted to the data system that is subsequently expunged pursuant
4 to federal law or the laws of the member state contributing the information shall be removed from
5 the data system.
6 5-64.2-11. Rulemaking.
7 (a) The compact commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and
8 efficiently implement and administer the purposes and provisions of the chapter. A rule shall be
9 invalid and have no force or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the rule is
10 invalid because the compact commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner that is
11 beyond the scope and purposes of the compact, or the powers granted hereunder, or based upon
12 another applicable standard of review.
13 (b) The rules of the compact commission shall have the force of law in each member state;
14 provided, however that, where the rules conflict with the laws or regulations of a member state that
15 relate to the procedures, actions, and processes a licensed dietitian is permitted to undertake in that
16 state and the circumstances under which they may do so, as held by a court of competent
17 jurisdiction, the rules of the compact commission shall be ineffective in that state to the extent of
18 the conflict.
19 (c) The compact commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria
20 set forth in this section and the rules adopted thereunder. Rules shall become binding on the day
21 following adoption or as of the date specified in the rule or amendment, whichever is later.
22 (d) If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule or portion of a rule,
23 by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact within four
24 (4) years of the date of adoption of the rule, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in
25 any member state.
26 (e) Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the compact commission.
27 (f) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the compact commission shall hold a public hearing
28 and allow persons to provide oral and written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments.
29 (g) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule by the compact commission, and at least thirty (30)
30 days in advance of the meeting at which the compact commission will hold a public hearing on the
31 proposed rule, the compact commission shall provide a notice of proposed rulemaking:
32 (1) On the website of the compact commission or other publicly accessible platform;
33 (2) To persons who have requested notice of the compact commission's notices of proposed
34 rulemaking; and
LC000769 - Page 16 of 23
1 (3) In such other way(s) as the compact commission may by rule specify.
2 (h) The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include:
3 (1) The time, date, and location of the public hearing at which the compact commission
4 will hear public comments on the proposed rule and, if different, the time, date, and location of the
5 meeting where the compact commission will consider and vote on the proposed rule;
6 (2) If the hearing is held via telecommunication, video conference, or other means of
7 communication, the compact commission shall include the mechanism for access to the hearing in
8 the notice of proposed rulemaking;
9 (3) The text of the proposed rule and the reason therefore;
10 (4) A request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested person; and
11 (5) The manner in which interested persons may submit written comments.
12 (i) All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording and all written comments and
13 documents received by the compact commission in response to the proposed rule shall be available
14 to the public.
15 (j) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule.
16 Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the compact commission at hearings required by this
17 section.
18 (k) The compact commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final action on
19 the proposed rule based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.
20 (1) The compact commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule provided the changes
21 do not enlarge the original purpose of the proposed rule.
22 (2) The compact commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for substantive
23 changes made to the proposed rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were
24 recommended by commenters.
25 (3) The compact commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the rule.
26 Except for an emergency as provided in subsection (l) of this section, the effective date of the rule
27 shall be no sooner than thirty (30) days after issuing the notice that it adopted or amended the rule.
28 (l) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the compact commission may consider
29 and adopt an emergency rule with twenty-four (24) hours notice, with opportunity to comment;
30 provided that, the usual rulemaking procedures provided in the compact and in this section shall be
31 retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety (90)
32 days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is
33 one that must be adopted immediately in order to:
34 (1) Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;
LC000769 - Page 17 of 23
1 (2) Prevent a loss of compact commission or member state funds;
2 (3) Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a rule that is established by federal law or rule;
3 or
4 (4) Protect public health and safety.
5 (m) The compact commission or an authorized committee of the compact commission may
6 direct revision to a previously adopted rule for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors
7 in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revision shall be posted
8 on the website of the compact commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person
9 for a period of thirty (30) days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that
10 the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered
11 to the compact commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the
12 revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not
13 take effect without the approval of the compact commission.
14 (n) No member state's rulemaking requirements shall apply under this chapter.
15 5-64.2-12. Oversight, dispute resolution and enforcement.
16 (a) Oversight.
17 (1) The executive and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall
18 enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement this compact.
19 (2) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, venue is proper and judicial proceedings
20 by or against the compact commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of
21 competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the compact commission is located. The
22 compact commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or
23 consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or
24 limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action against a licensee for professional
25 malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter.
26 (3) The compact commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any
27 proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the compact and shall have standing to
28 intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the compact commission service
29 of process shall render a judgment or order void as to the compact commission, this compact, or
30 promulgated rules.
31 (b) Default, technical assistance and termination.
32 (1) If the compact commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the
33 performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this chapter or the promulgated rules, the
34 compact commission shall provide written notice to the defaulting state. The notice of default shall
LC000769 - Page 18 of 23
1 describe the default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any other action that the compact
2 commission may take and shall offer training and specific technical assistance regarding the
3 default.
4 (2) The compact commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the other
5 member states.
6 (c) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from
7 the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the member states, and all
8 rights, privileges, and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on the
9 effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations
10 or liabilities incurred during the period of default.
11 (d) Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means
12 of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given
13 by the compact commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting
14 state's legislature, the defaulting state's licensing authority, and each of the member states' licensing
15 authority.
16 (e) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and
17 liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend
18 beyond the effective date of termination.
19 (f) Upon the termination of a state's membership from this compact, that state shall
20 immediately provide notice to all licensees within that state of such termination. The terminated
21 state shall continue to recognize all compact privileges granted pursuant to this compact for a
22 minimum of six (6) months after the date of said notice of termination.
23 (g) The compact commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be
24 in default or that has been terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the
25 compact commission and the defaulting state.
26 (h) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the compact commission by petitioning
27 the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the compact
28 commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such
29 litigation, including reasonable attorneys' fees.
30 (i) Dispute resolution.
31 (1) Upon request by a member state, the compact commission shall attempt to resolve
32 disputes related to the compact that arise among member states and between member and non-
33 member states.
34 (2) The compact commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and
LC000769 - Page 19 of 23
1 binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
2 (j) Enforcement.
3 (1) By supermajority vote, the compact commission may initiate legal action against a
4 member state in default in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal
5 district where the compact commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the
6 provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive
7 relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be
8 awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneys' fees. The remedies herein shall
9 not be the exclusive remedies of the compact commission. The compact commission may pursue
10 any other remedies available under federal or the defaulting member state's law.
11 (1) A member state may initiate legal action against the compact commission in the U.S.
12 District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the compact commission
13 has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its
14 promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event
15 judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation,
16 including reasonable attorneys' fees.
17 (3) No party other than a member state shall enforce this compact against the compact
18 commission.
19 5-64.2-13. Effective date, withdrawal and amendment.
20 (a) The compact shall come into effect on the date on which the compact is enacted into
21 law in the seventh member state.
22 (1) On or after the effective date of the compact, the compact commission shall convene
23 and review the enactment of each of the first seven (7) member states ("charter member states") to
24 determine if the statute enacted by each such charter member state is materially different than the
25 model compact statute.
26 (i) A charter member state whose enactment is found to be materially different from the
27 model compact statute shall be entitled to the default process set forth in § 5-64.2-12.
28 (ii) If any member state is later found to be in default, or is terminated, or withdraws from
29 the compact, the compact commission shall remain in existence and the compact shall remain in
30 effect even if the number of member states should be less than seven (7).
31 (2) Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the seven (7) initial charter member
32 states shall be subject to the process set forth in § 5-64.2-9 to determine if their enactments are
33 materially different from the model compact statute and whether they qualify for participation in
34 the compact.
LC000769 - Page 20 of 23
1 (3) All actions taken for the benefit of the compact commission or in furtherance of the
2 purposes of the administration of the compact prior to the effective date of the compact or the
3 compact commission coming into existence shall be considered to be actions of the compact
4 commission unless specifically repudiated by the compact commission.
5 (4) Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the compact commission's initial
6 adoption of the rules and bylaws shall be subject to the rules and bylaws as they exist on the date
7 on which the compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the
8 compact commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the compact becomes
9 law in that state.
10 (b) Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the
11 same.
12 (1) A member state's withdrawal shall not take effect until one hundred eighty (180) days
13 after enactment of the repealing statute.
14 (2) Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing state's
15 licensing authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of
16 this compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
17 (3) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this compact, a state shall
18 immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all licensees within that state. Notwithstanding
19 any subsequent statutory enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing state shall continue to
20 recognize all compact privileges granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of one hundred
21 eight (180) days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.
22 (c) Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any
23 licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state and a non-member
24 state that does not conflict with the provisions of this chapter.
25 (d) The compact may be amended by the member states. No amendment to the compact
26 shall become effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all
27 member states.
28 5-64.2-14. Construction and severability.
29 (a) This compact and the compact commission's rulemaking authority shall be liberally
30 construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the implementation and administration of the
31 compact. Provisions of the compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules
32 shall not be construed to limit the compact commission's rulemaking authority solely for those
33 purposes.
34 (b) The provisions of this chapter shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or
LC000769 - Page 21 of 23
1 provision of this chapter is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the
2 constitution of any member state, a state seeking participation in the compact, or of the United
3 States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to
4 be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this chapter
5 and the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be
6 affected thereby.
7 (c) Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, the compact commission may deny a
8 state's participation in the compact or, in accordance with the requirements of § 5-64.2-12,
9 terminate a member state's participation in the compact, if it determines that a constitutional
10 requirement of a member state is a material departure from the compact. Otherwise, if this compact
11 shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, the compact shall remain in
12 full force and effect as to the remaining member states and in full force and effect as to the member
13 state affected as to all severable matters.
14 5-64.2-15. Consistent effect and conflict with other state laws.
15 (a) Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any other law of a member
16 state that is not inconsistent with the compact.
17 (b) Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements in a member state in conflict
18 with the compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.
19 (c) All permissible agreements between the compact commission and the member states
20 are binding in accordance with their terms.
21 SECTION 2. This act shall take effect upon passage.

2 (3) The former home state shall convert the former home state license into a compact
3 privilege once the new home state has activated the new home state license in accordance with
4 applicable rules adopted by the compact commission.
5 (4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if the licensee cannot meet the
6 criteria set forth in § 5-64.2-5, the new home state may apply its requirements for issuing a new

12 issuance of a single state license in the new state.

28 testimony of witnesses as well as the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a licensing
29 authority in a member state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of
30 evidence from another member state shall be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent
31 jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings
32 pending before that court. The issuing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses,

6 appropriate action.
7 (d) The home state shall complete any pending investigations of a licensee who changes

24 other member states shall be revoked until all encumbrances have been removed from the home
25 state license. All home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against a licensee shall
26 include a statement that the licensee's compact privileges are revoked in all member states during
27 the pendency of the order.
28 (i) Once an encumbered license in the home state is restored to an unencumbered license
29 (as certified by the home state's licensing authority), the licensee must meet the requirements of §
30 5-64.2-5 and follow the administrative requirements to reapply to obtain a compact privilege in any
31 remote state.
32 (j) If a member state takes adverse action, it shall promptly notify the administrator of the
33 data system. The administrator of the data system shall promptly notify the other member states

6 (xii) Other matters as specified in the rules of the compact commission.
7 (3) If a meeting, or portion of a meeting, is closed, the presiding officer shall state that the
8 meeting will be closed and reference each relevant exempting provision, and such reference shall
9 be recorded in the minutes.
10 (4) The compact commission shall keep minutes that fully and clearly describe all matters
11 discussed in a meeting and shall provide a full and accurate summary of actions taken, and the
12 reasons therefore, including a description of the views expressed. All documents considered in
13 connection with an action shall be identified in such minutes. All minutes and documents of a
14 closed meeting shall remain under seal, subject to release only by a majority vote of the compact
15 commission or order of a court of competent jurisdiction.
16 (g) Financing of the compact commission.
17 (1) The compact commission shall pay, or provide for the payment of, the reasonable
18 expenses of its establishment, organization, and ongoing activities.
19 (2) The compact commission may accept any and all appropriate revenue sources as
20 provided in subsection (c) of this section.
21 (3) The compact commission may levy on and collect an annual assessment from each
22 member state and impose fees on licensees of member states to whom it grants a compact privilege
23 to cover the cost of the operations and activities of the compact commission and its staff, which
24 must, in a total amount, be sufficient to cover its annual budget as approved each year for which
25 revenue is not provided by other sources. The aggregate annual assessment amount for member
26 states shall be allocated based upon a formula that the compact commission shall promulgate by
27 rule.
28 (4) The compact commission shall not incur obligations of any kind prior to securing the
29 funds adequate to meet the same; nor shall the compact commission pledge the credit of any of the
30 member states, except by and with the authority of the member state.
31 (5) The compact commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and
32 disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the compact commission shall be subject to the

LC000769 - Page 13 of 23

1 review by a certified or licensed public accountant, and the report of the financial review shall be
2 included in and become part of the annual report of the compact commission.
3 (h) Qualified immunity, defense, and indemnification.
4 (1) The members, officers, executive director, employees and representatives of the
5 compact commission shall be immune from suit and liability, both personally and in their official
6 capacity, for any claim for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or other civil liability
7 caused by or arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred, or that the
8 person against whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the
9 scope of compact commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided that, nothing in
10 this section shall be construed to protect any such person from suit or liability for any damage, loss,

12 procurement of insurance of any type by the compact commission shall not in any way compromise
13 or limit the immunity granted hereunder.
14 (2) The compact commission shall defend any member, officer, executive director,
15 employee, and representative of the compact commission in any civil action seeking to impose
16 liability arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope
17 of compact commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or as determined by the compact
18 commission that the person against whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis for believing
19 occurred within the scope of compact commission employment, duties, or responsibilities;
20 provided that, nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit that person from retaining their own
21 counsel at their own expense; and provided, further, that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission
22 did not result from that person's intentional or willful or wanton misconduct.
23 (3) The compact commission shall indemnify and hold harmless any member, officer,
24 executive director, employee, and representative of the compact commission for the amount of any
25 settlement or judgment obtained against that person arising out of any actual or alleged act, error,
26 or omission that occurred within the scope of compact commission employment, duties, or
27 responsibilities, or that such person had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope
28 of compact commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided that, the actual or alleged
29 act, error, or omission did not result from the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of that
30 person.
31 (4) Nothing herein shall be construed as a limitation on the liability of any licensee for
32 professional malpractice or misconduct, which shall be governed solely by any other applicable
33 state laws.
34 (5) Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted to waive or otherwise abrogate a member
LC000769 - Page 14 of 23

1 state's state action immunity or state action affirmative defense with respect to antitrust claims
2 under the Sherman Act, Clayton Act, or any other state or federal antitrust or anticompetitive law
3 or regulation.

12 submit a uniform data set to the data system on all individuals to whom this compact is applicable
13 as required by the rules of the compact commission, including:
14 (1) Identifying information;
15 (2) Licensure data;
16 (3) Adverse actions against a license or compact privilege and information related thereto;
17 (4) Non-confidential information related to alternative program participation, the
18 beginning and ending dates of such participation, and other information related to such participation

20 (5) Any denial of application for licensure, and the reason(s) for such denial;
21 (6) The presence of current significant investigative information; and
22 (7) Other information that may facilitate the administration of this chapter or the protection
23 of the public, as determined by the rules of the compact commission.
24 (d) The records and information provided to a member state pursuant to this chapter or
25 through the data system, when certified by the compact commission or an agent thereof, shall
26 constitute the authenticated business records of the compact commission, and shall be entitled to
27 any associated hearsay exception in any relevant judicial, quasi-judicial, or administrative
28 proceedings in a member state.
29 (e) Current significant investigative information pertaining to a licensee in any member
30 state will only be available to other member states.
31 (f) It is the responsibility of the member states to report any adverse action against a
32 licensee and to monitor the data system to determine whether any adverse action has been taken
33 against a licensee. Adverse action information pertaining to a licensee in any member state will be
34 available to any other member state.
LC000769 - Page 15 of 23

1 (g) Member states contributing information to the data system may designate information
2 that may not be shared with the public without the express permission of the contributing state.
3 (h) Any information submitted to the data system that is subsequently expunged pursuant
4 to federal law or the laws of the member state contributing the information shall be removed from
5 the data system.
6 5-64.2-11. Rulemaking.
7 (a) The compact commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and
8 efficiently implement and administer the purposes and provisions of the chapter. A rule shall be
9 invalid and have no force or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the rule is
10 invalid because the compact commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner that is
11 beyond the scope and purposes of the compact, or the powers granted hereunder, or based upon
12 another applicable standard of review.
13 (b) The rules of the compact commission shall have the force of law in each member state;
14 provided, however that, where the rules conflict with the laws or regulations of a member state that
15 relate to the procedures, actions, and processes a licensed dietitian is permitted to undertake in that
16 state and the circumstances under which they may do so, as held by a court of competent
17 jurisdiction, the rules of the compact commission shall be ineffective in that state to the extent of
18 the conflict.
19 (c) The compact commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria
20 set forth in this section and the rules adopted thereunder. Rules shall become binding on the day
21 following adoption or as of the date specified in the rule or amendment, whichever is later.
22 (d) If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule or portion of a rule,
23 by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact within four
24 (4) years of the date of adoption of the rule, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in
25 any member state.
26 (e) Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the compact commission.
27 (f) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the compact commission shall hold a public hearing
28 and allow persons to provide oral and written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments.
29 (g) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule by the compact commission, and at least thirty (30)
30 days in advance of the meeting at which the compact commission will hold a public hearing on the
31 proposed rule, the compact commission shall provide a notice of proposed rulemaking:
32 (1) On the website of the compact commission or other publicly accessible platform;
33 (2) To persons who have requested notice of the compact commission's notices of proposed
34 rulemaking; and
LC000769 - Page 16 of 23

1 (3) In such other way(s) as the compact commission may by rule specify.
2 (h) The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include:
3 (1) The time, date, and location of the public hearing at which the compact commission
4 will hear public comments on the proposed rule and, if different, the time, date, and location of the
5 meeting where the compact commission will consider and vote on the proposed rule;
6 (2) If the hearing is held via telecommunication, video conference, or other means of
7 communication, the compact commission shall include the mechanism for access to the hearing in
8 the notice of proposed rulemaking;
9 (3) The text of the proposed rule and the reason therefore;
10 (4) A request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested person; and
11 (5) The manner in which interested persons may submit written comments.
12 (i) All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording and all written comments and
13 documents received by the compact commission in response to the proposed rule shall be available
14 to the public.
15 (j) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule.
16 Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the compact commission at hearings required by this
17 section.
18 (k) The compact commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final action on
19 the proposed rule based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.
20 (1) The compact commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule provided the changes
21 do not enlarge the original purpose of the proposed rule.
22 (2) The compact commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for substantive
23 changes made to the proposed rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were
24 recommended by commenters.
25 (3) The compact commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the rule.
26 Except for an emergency as provided in subsection (l) of this section, the effective date of the rule
27 shall be no sooner than thirty (30) days after issuing the notice that it adopted or amended the rule.
28 (l) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the compact commission may consider
29 and adopt an emergency rule with twenty-four (24) hours notice, with opportunity to comment;
30 provided that, the usual rulemaking procedures provided in the compact and in this section shall be
31 retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety (90)
32 days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is
33 one that must be adopted immediately in order to:
34 (1) Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;
LC000769 - Page 17 of 23

1 (2) Prevent a loss of compact commission or member state funds;
2 (3) Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a rule that is established by federal law or rule;
3 or
4 (4) Protect public health and safety.
5 (m) The compact commission or an authorized committee of the compact commission may
6 direct revision to a previously adopted rule for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors
7 in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revision shall be posted
8 on the website of the compact commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person
9 for a period of thirty (30) days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that
10 the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered
11 to the compact commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the
12 revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not
13 take effect without the approval of the compact commission.
14 (n) No member state's rulemaking requirements shall apply under this chapter.
15 5-64.2-12. Oversight, dispute resolution and enforcement.
16 (a) Oversight.
17 (1) The executive and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall
18 enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement this compact.
19 (2) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, venue is proper and judicial proceedings
20 by or against the compact commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of
21 competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the compact commission is located. The
22 compact commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or
23 consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or
24 limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action against a licensee for professional
25 malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter.
26 (3) The compact commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any
27 proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the compact and shall have standing to
28 intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the compact commission service
29 of process shall render a judgment or order void as to the compact commission, this compact, or
30 promulgated rules.
31 (b) Default, technical assistance and termination.
32 (1) If the compact commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the
33 performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this chapter or the promulgated rules, the
34 compact commission shall provide written notice to the defaulting state. The notice of default shall
LC000769 - Page 18 of 23

1 describe the default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any other action that the compact
2 commission may take and shall offer training and specific technical assistance regarding the
3 default.
4 (2) The compact commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the other
5 member states.
6 (c) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from
7 the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the member states, and all
8 rights, privileges, and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on the
9 effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations
10 or liabilities incurred during the period of default.
11 (d) Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means
12 of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given
13 by the compact commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting
14 state's legislature, the defaulting state's licensing authority, and each of the member states' licensing
15 authority.
16 (e) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and
17 liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend
18 beyond the effective date of termination.
19 (f) Upon the termination of a state's membership from this compact, that state shall
20 immediately provide notice to all licensees within that state of such termination. The terminated
21 state shall continue to recognize all compact privileges granted pursuant to this compact for a
22 minimum of six (6) months after the date of said notice of termination.
23 (g) The compact commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be
24 in default or that has been terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the
25 compact commission and the defaulting state.
26 (h) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the compact commission by petitioning
27 the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the compact
28 commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such
29 litigation, including reasonable attorneys' fees.
30 (i) Dispute resolution.
31 (1) Upon request by a member state, the compact commission shall attempt to resolve
32 disputes related to the compact that arise among member states and between member and non-
33 member states.
34 (2) The compact commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and
LC000769 - Page 19 of 23

1 binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
2 (j) Enforcement.
3 (1) By supermajority vote, the compact commission may initiate legal action against a
4 member state in default in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal
5 district where the compact commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the
6 provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive
7 relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be
8 awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneys' fees. The remedies herein shall
9 not be the exclusive remedies of the compact commission. The compact commission may pursue
10 any other remedies available under federal or the defaulting member state's law.
11 (1) A member state may initiate legal action against the compact commission in the U.S.
12 District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the compact commission
13 has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its
14 promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event
15 judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation,
16 including reasonable attorneys' fees.
17 (3) No party other than a member state shall enforce this compact against the compact
18 commission.
19 5-64.2-13. Effective date, withdrawal and amendment.
20 (a) The compact shall come into effect on the date on which the compact is enacted into
21 law in the seventh member state.
22 (1) On or after the effective date of the compact, the compact commission shall convene
23 and review the enactment of each of the first seven (7) member states ("charter member states") to
24 determine if the statute enacted by each such charter member state is materially different than the
25 model compact statute.
26 (i) A charter member state whose enactment is found to be materially different from the
27 model compact statute shall be entitled to the default process set forth in § 5-64.2-12.
28 (ii) If any member state is later found to be in default, or is terminated, or withdraws from
29 the compact, the compact commission shall remain in existence and the compact shall remain in
30 effect even if the number of member states should be less than seven (7).
31 (2) Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the seven (7) initial charter member
32 states shall be subject to the process set forth in § 5-64.2-9 to determine if their enactments are
33 materially different from the model compact statute and whether they qualify for participation in
34 the compact.
LC000769 - Page 20 of 23

1 (3) All actions taken for the benefit of the compact commission or in furtherance of the
2 purposes of the administration of the compact prior to the effective date of the compact or the
3 compact commission coming into existence shall be considered to be actions of the compact
4 commission unless specifically repudiated by the compact commission.
5 (4) Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the compact commission's initial
6 adoption of the rules and bylaws shall be subject to the rules and bylaws as they exist on the date
7 on which the compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the
8 compact commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the compact becomes
9 law in that state.
10 (b) Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the
11 same.
12 (1) A member state's withdrawal shall not take effect until one hundred eighty (180) days
13 after enactment of the repealing statute.
14 (2) Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing state's
15 licensing authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of
16 this compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
17 (3) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this compact, a state shall
18 immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all licensees within that state. Notwithstanding
19 any subsequent statutory enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing state shall continue to
20 recognize all compact privileges granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of one hundred
21 eight (180) days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.
22 (c) Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any
23 licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state and a non-member
24 state that does not conflict with the provisions of this chapter.
25 (d) The compact may be amended by the member states. No amendment to the compact
26 shall become effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all
27 member states.
28 5-64.2-14. Construction and severability.
29 (a) This compact and the compact commission's rulemaking authority shall be liberally
30 construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the implementation and administration of the
31 compact. Provisions of the compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules
32 shall not be construed to limit the compact commission's rulemaking authority solely for those
33 purposes.
34 (b) The provisions of this chapter shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or
LC000769 - Page 21 of 23

1 provision of this chapter is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the
2 constitution of any member state, a state seeking participation in the compact, or of the United
3 States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to
4 be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this chapter
5 and the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be
6 affected thereby.
7 (c) Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, the compact commission may deny a
8 state's participation in the compact or, in accordance with the requirements of § 5-64.2-12,
9 terminate a member state's participation in the compact, if it determines that a constitutional
10 requirement of a member state is a material departure from the compact. Otherwise, if this compact
11 shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, the compact shall remain in
12 full force and effect as to the remaining member states and in full force and effect as to the member
13 state affected as to all severable matters.
14 5-64.2-15. Consistent effect and conflict with other state laws.
15 (a) Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any other law of a member
16 state that is not inconsistent with the compact.
17 (b) Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements in a member state in conflict
18 with the compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.
19 (c) All permissible agreements between the compact commission and the member states
20 are binding in accordance with their terms.
21 SECTION 2. This act shall take effect upon passage.
