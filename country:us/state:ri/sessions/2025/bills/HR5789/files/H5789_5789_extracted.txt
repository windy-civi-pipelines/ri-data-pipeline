WALKING PATH IN CRANSTON
Introduced By: Representatives Paplauskas, Baginski, Potter, Lima, Fascia, Quattrocchi,
McNamara, and Handy
Date Introduced: February 26, 2025
Referred To: House Finance
1 WHEREAS, Meshanticut Lake, located within Cranston, is the focal point of
2 Meshanticut State Park, a beloved public park that boasts a paved walking path that encircles the
3 12-acre lake; and
4 WHEREAS, In 1910, John M. Dean donated Meshanticut Park and its lake to the
5 Metropolitan Park Commission, coinciding with Cranston's transition from a town to a city. The
6 Metropolitan Park Commission, established in the early 1900s, was responsible for acquiring and
7 managing parklands in Rhode Island; and
8 WHEREAS, The State's park system expanded, and the management of these parks,
9 including Meshanticut Park which was purchased by the State of Rhode Island for $600, was
10 integrated into the Department of Environmental Management (DEM). This transition ensured
11 that Meshanticut Park became part of the State's portfolio of recreational areas, preserving it for
12 public use and enjoyment; and
13 WHEREAS, In 2021, the DEM estimated that addressing infrastructure needs at the
14 park—including road repairs, erosion control, tree maintenance, and bench installations—would
15 require an investment of between $2 million and $2.5 million; and
16 WHEREAS, Cranston, home to 82,000+ people, is the second-largest city within the
17 State of Rhode Island, and Meshanticut Lake walking path is an important recreational amenity
18 enjoyed by its diverse community; and
19 WHEREAS, The paved walking path is highly utilized by thousands of individuals of all
1 ages for activities such as walking, running, cycling, and dog walking, promoting health, well-
2 being, recreation, and community engagement; and
3 WHEREAS, Local youth athletes, including students from Cranston High School West,
4 Cranston High School East, Western Hills Middle School, and participants in the Cranston
5 League for Cranston’s Future (CLCF) youth programs, regularly use the path for training and
6 conditioning, contributing to their physical development and team-building experiences; and
7 WHEREAS, Years of use causing wear and tear, extreme weather conditions, and lack of
8 maintenance have caused cracks, uneven terrain, and hazardous conditions along the paved path,
9 posing safety risks to users and detracting from the park’s overall appeal; and
10 WHEREAS, Investing in the restoration and improvement of the pedestrian pathway;
11 including, but not limited to, resurfacing and structural reinforcements, is essential to ensure safe
12 and equitable access for all members of the community, including individuals with mobility
13 impairments; and
14 WHEREAS, Such upgrades will improve Cranston residents’ quality of life, support local
15 youth athletic programs, and preserve the park as a vital suburban green space for all Rhode
16 Island residents; now, therefore be it
17 RESOLVED, That there is hereby appropriated, out of any money in the treasury not
18 otherwise appropriated for the fiscal year 2025-2026, the sum of one million dollars ($1,000,000)
19 to restore and enhance the Meshanticut Lake paved walking path, ensuring it remains a safe and
20 accessible resource for all users; and the state controller is hereby authorized and directed to draw
21 their orders upon the general treasurer for the payment of said sum, or so much thereof as may be
22 from time to time required, upon receipt of properly authenticated vouchers; and be it further
23 RESOLVED, That members of the public are encouraged to participate in the upcoming
24 hearing to voice their support for this critical community investment.
