5 nominating commission; and/or
6 (ii) The judicial nominating commission votes to terminate the individual’s eligibility.
7 However, such individuals must reapply for any subsequent vacancy, or prospective vacancy, in
8 the same court for the position of presiding justice, chief justice, or chief judge. Any individual

30 shall appoint some other person to fill the vacancy and shall submit his or her appointment to the
31 senate for confirmation in like manner until the senate shall confirm the nomination. If the nominee

11 such subpoenas and orders shall be served as subpoenas in civil cases in the superior court are
12 served, and witnesses so subpoenaed shall be entitled to the same fees for attendance and travel as

19 for a rule or order returnable in not less than two (2), nor more than five (5), days, directing the
20 person to show cause before the justice who made the order or any other justice of the superior
21 court, why he or she should not be adjudged in contempt. Upon the return of the order, the justice
22 before whom the matter is brought on for hearing shall examine under oath the person, and the
23 person shall be given an opportunity to be heard, and if the justice shall determine that the person
24 has refused without reasonable cause or legal excuse to be examined, or to answer a legal and
25 pertinent question, or to produce books, accounts, papers, records, and documents material to the
26 issue that he or she was ordered to bring or produce, he or she may forthwith commit the offender
27 to the adult correctional institutions, there to remain until the person submits to do the act which he
28 or she was so required to do, or is discharged according to law.
29 (e) The committee shall, for the purpose of investigating the qualifications of the nominee
30 or nominees, be furnished with a report compiled by the state police in conjunction with the attorney
31 general’s office indicating the determinations and findings of the state police and attorney general’s
32 office investigations concerning the background of the nominee or nominees, and the report shall
33 include, but not be limited to, the following:
34 (1) Whether the nominee has ever been convicted of, or pleaded guilty to, a misdemeanor

3 the benefit of creditors in this or any other state or foreign country; and whether the nominee has
4 ever been a partner in, held ten percent (10%) or more of stock in, or held office in any sole
5 proprietorship, partnership, or corporation that has been involved in bankruptcy or receivership
6 actions as a debtor or because of insolvency at the time the nominee was a partner in, held ten
7 percent (10%) or more stock in, or held office in any such sole proprietorship, partnership, or
8 corporation;
9 (3) Whether the nominee has ever had a civil judgment rendered against him or her arising
10 out of an allegation of fraud, misrepresentation, libel, slander, professional negligence, or any
11 intentional tort in this state or any other state or foreign country;
12 (4) The state police, in conjunction with the attorney general’s department, shall provide
13 in their report the names and addresses of each and every source of their information.
14 (f) The reports set forth in this section shall be delivered to the chairperson and members
15 of the senate judiciary committee in addition to the nominee or nominees only prior to the
16 commencement of the public hearing. Provided, however, that if the nominee or nominees
17 withdraw or decline the appointment prior to the public hearing, then the report or reports shall be
18 returned to the chairperson of the judiciary committee and destroyed.
19 (g) The committee shall also require a financial statement to be submitted by each nominee,
20 prior to the public hearing, to the chairperson of the senate judiciary committee, to investigate each
21 nominee to determine his or her compliance with the provisions of chapter 14 of title 36.
22 (h) Any associate justice of any state court who is appointed to serve as the chief or
23 presiding justice of that court on an interim basis shall retain his or her status as an associate justice
24 until the appointment to chief or presiding justice is made permanent.
25 (i) In case a vacancy shall occur when the senate is not in session, the governor shall appoint
