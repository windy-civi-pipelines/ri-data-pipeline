PROCLAIMING MARCH OF 2025, AS "COLORECTAL CANCER AWARENESS MONTH"
IN THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND
Introduced By: Senators Murray, Ruggerio, Lauria, Vargas, Ujifusa, Felag, E Morgan,
Britto, Raptakis, and Urso
Date Introduced: March 11, 2025
Referred To: Recommended for Immediate Consideration
1 WHEREAS, The American Cancer Society encourages the citizens of the State of Rhode
2 Island to observe March of 2025, as "Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month"; and
3 WHEREAS, Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths
4 among men and women combined in Rhode Island as well as in the United States; and
5 WHEREAS, According to the American Cancer Society, it was estimated that there
6 would be 152,810 new cases of colon and rectal cancer in the United States and 53,010 deaths
7 from colorectal cancer in 2024, and in Rhode Island, there were an estimated 470 new cases of
8 colorectal cancer, and 160 deaths from colorectal cancer; and
9 WHEREAS, When colorectal cancer is found early, it has a survival rate of 90 percent,
10 but left undetected, survival rates for colorectal cancer can plummet to 10 percent; and
11 WHEREAS, There are often no symptoms of colorectal cancer, but regular screenings
12 can significantly reduce the number of deaths from this disease by detecting cancerous or pre-
13 cancerous conditions early, when treatment is most effective; and
14 WHEREAS, Education can help inform the public of methods of early detection and
15 prevention. Colorectal cancer is largely preventable with screening tests that find and remove pre-
16 cancerous polyps; and
17 WHEREAS, In 2021, our dear friend and colleague, Senator Maryellen Goodwin was
18 honored with the American Cancer Society's "National Distinguished Advocacy Award", the
19 organization's highest recognition, for her efforts to educate and bring awareness to colorectal

1 cancer, which included championing the passage of the "Maryellen Goodwin Colorectal Cancer
2 Screening Act" that mandated full coverage for preventive screenings and colonoscopies; and
3 WHEREAS, Working with the legislature, the American Cancer Society remains
4 committed and dedicated to informing the public about colorectal cancer prevention and
5 screening; now, therefore be it
6 RESOLVED, That this Senate of the State of Rhode Island hereby proclaims March of
7 2025, as "Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month"; and be it further
8 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
9 transmit duly certified copies of this resolution to the American Cancer Society, and Dr. Jonathan
10 A. Leighton, MD, FACG, American College of Gastroenterology.
