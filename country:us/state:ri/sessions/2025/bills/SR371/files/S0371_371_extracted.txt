3 and throughout the world that have achieved independence and live in peace and freedom; and
4 WHEREAS, The people of the Dominican Republic acquired their independence from
5 Spain on February 27, 1844; and

7 opportunity for all people to reflect upon the rich history of the Dominican Republic and the
8 many contributions of Latin Americans to our country as well as the world; and
9 WHEREAS, February 27th has been designated as Dominican Independence Day in the
10 State of Rhode Island; and

12 which Dominicans have brought to our State and our nation; and
13 WHEREAS, On February 27th, the people of the Dominican Republic, and all free
14 people, will celebrate 181 years of Dominican Independence; and
15 WHEREAS, The seat of the original capital of the Spanish New World, the Dominican
16 Republic, proclaims a host of American firsts: the first permanent European settlement, the first
17 university, the first church, the first cathedral, the first mass, and the first royal court; and
18 WHEREAS, On February 27, 1844, the Declaration of Independence was written by Juan
19 Pablo Duarte, Franscisco del Rosaro Sanchez and Ramon Matias Mella; and

12 the community imparts a rich history and vitality through their presence in our Ocean State. The

14 local businesses owned by Dominican immigrants, are evidenced by their myriad contributions,
15 greatly adding to the economic vitality of our State; and
16 WHEREAS, The Dominican-American community plays another essential role through

20 RESOLVED, That this Senate of the State of Rhode Island hereby commemorates the
21 181st Anniversary of Dominican Republic Independence on February 27, 2025, and proudly
22 recognizes the significant contributions that Dominicans have made to the State of Rhode Island
23 and the United States; and be it further
