9 provider, such partial payment may be paid by the CSF, if funds are available, prior to the start of
10 the school year in which the EFA is awarded and deducted in an equitable manner from subsequent
11 quarterly EFA deposits to ensure adequate funds remain available throughout the school year.

13 payment shall be returned to the CSF by such education service provider and credited to the
14 student's EFA.
15 (9) The CSF shall continue making deposits into a student's EFA until:
16 (i) The CSF determines that the EFA student is no longer an eligible student;

24 event of intentional and substantial misuse of EFA funds.
25 (i) The CSF shall create procedures to ensure that a fair process exists to determine whether
26 an intentional and substantial misuse of EFA funds has occurred.
27 (ii) If an EFA student is free from personal misconduct, that student shall be eligible for an

29 behalf of the student.
30 (iii) The CSF may refer suspected cases of intentional and substantial misuse of EFA funds
31 to the attorney general for investigation if evidence of fraudulent use of EFA funds is obtained.

33 program to the department.
34 (12) The CSF may bar an education service provider from accepting payments from EFAs
LC000374 - Page 6 of 8
1 if the CSF determines that the education service provider has:
2 (i) Intentionally and substantially misrepresented information or failed to refund any
3 overpayments in a timely manner; or
4 (ii) Routinely failed to provide students with promised educational goods or services.
5 (13) The CSF shall create procedures to ensure that a fair process exists to determine
6 whether an education service provider may be barred from receiving payments from EFAs.
7 (i) If the CSF bars an education service provider from receiving payments from EFAs, it
8 shall notify parents and EFA students of its decision as soon as possible.
9 (ii) Education service providers may appeal the CSF's decision to bar them from receiving
10 payments from the EFA to the department.
11 (14) The CSF may accept gifts and grants from any source to cover administrative costs,

21 hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) in EFA funds;
22 (iv) Refunding payments from education service providers to EFAs; and
23 (v) Ensuring appropriate use and rigorous oversight of all funds expended under this
24 program.

11 (2) If an eligible student decides to return to the EFA program, payments into the student's
12 existing EFA may resume if the EFA is still open and active. A new EFA may be established if the
13 student's EFA was closed.
14 16-117-6. Authority and responsibilities of the children's scholarship fund.
15 The CSF shall have the following additional duties, obligations, and authority:
16 (1) The CSF shall maintain an updated list of education service providers and shall ensure
17 that the list is publicly available through various sources, electronically and in a hard-copy format.
18 (2) The CSF shall provide parents with a written explanation of the allowable uses of EFA
19 funds, the responsibilities of parents, the duties of the CSF, and the role of any financial
20 management firms that the CSF may contract with to administer any aspect of the EFA program.
21 (3) The CSF shall ensure that parents of students with disabilities receive notice that
22 participation in the EFA program is a placement pursuant to 20 U.S.C. § 1412, Individuals with
23 Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), along with an explanation of the rights that parentally placed
24 students possess under IDEA and any applicable state laws.
25 (4) The CSF shall, in cooperation with the department, determine eligibility for
26 differentiated aid subject to any applicable state and federal laws.
27 (5) The CSF may withhold from deposits or deduct from EFAs an amount to cover the

29 (6) The CSF shall implement a commercially viable system of payment for services from
30 EFAs to education service providers by electronic or online funds transfer.
31 (i) The CSF shall not adopt a system that relies exclusively on requiring parents to be
32 reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses, but rather shall provide maximum flexibility to parents by
33 facilitating direct payments to education service providers. The CSF may pre-approve requests for
34 reimbursements for qualifying expenses, including expenses pursuant to §16-117-4(b), but shall
LC000374 - Page 5 of 8

6 of the same system that facilitates the electronic or online funds transfers.
7 (8) If an education service provider requires partial payment of tuition or fees prior to the
8 start of the academic year to reserve space for an EFA student admitted to the education service
9 provider, such partial payment may be paid by the CSF, if funds are available, prior to the start of
10 the school year in which the EFA is awarded and deducted in an equitable manner from subsequent
11 quarterly EFA deposits to ensure adequate funds remain available throughout the school year.
12 However, if an EFA student decides not to use the education service provider, the partial reservation
13 payment shall be returned to the CSF by such education service provider and credited to the
14 student's EFA.
15 (9) The CSF shall continue making deposits into a student's EFA until:
16 (i) The CSF determines that the EFA student is no longer an eligible student;
17 (ii) The CSF determines that there was substantial misuse of the funds in the EFA;
18 (iii) The parent or EFA student withdraws from the EFA program;
19 (iv) The EFA student enrolls full-time in the public school of their residential district; or
20 (v) The EFA student graduates from high school.
21 (10) The CSF may conduct or contract for the auditing of individual EFAs, and shall at a
22 minimum conduct random audits of EFAs on an annual basis.
23 (11) The CSF may make any parent or EFA student ineligible for the EFA program in the
24 event of intentional and substantial misuse of EFA funds.
25 (i) The CSF shall create procedures to ensure that a fair process exists to determine whether
26 an intentional and substantial misuse of EFA funds has occurred.
27 (ii) If an EFA student is free from personal misconduct, that student shall be eligible for an
28 EFA in the future if placed with a new guardian or other person with the legal authority to act on
29 behalf of the student.
30 (iii) The CSF may refer suspected cases of intentional and substantial misuse of EFA funds
31 to the attorney general for investigation if evidence of fraudulent use of EFA funds is obtained.
32 (iv) A parent or EFA student may appeal the CSF's decision to deny eligibility for the EFA
33 program to the department.
34 (12) The CSF may bar an education service provider from accepting payments from EFAs
LC000374 - Page 6 of 8

1 if the CSF determines that the education service provider has:
2 (i) Intentionally and substantially misrepresented information or failed to refund any
3 overpayments in a timely manner; or
4 (ii) Routinely failed to provide students with promised educational goods or services.
5 (13) The CSF shall create procedures to ensure that a fair process exists to determine
6 whether an education service provider may be barred from receiving payments from EFAs.
7 (i) If the CSF bars an education service provider from receiving payments from EFAs, it
8 shall notify parents and EFA students of its decision as soon as possible.
9 (ii) Education service providers may appeal the CSF's decision to bar them from receiving
10 payments from the EFA to the department.
11 (14) The CSF may accept gifts and grants from any source to cover administrative costs,
12 to inform the public about the EFA program, or to fund additional EFAs.
13 (15) The department shall adopt rules and regulations that are necessary for the
14 administration of this chapter.
15 (16) The CSF shall adopt policies or procedures that are necessary for the administration
16 of this chapter, including, but not limited to:

18 reporting service;
19 (ii) Establishing an anonymous telephone number for fraud reporting;

21 hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) in EFA funds;
22 (iv) Refunding payments from education service providers to EFAs; and
23 (v) Ensuring appropriate use and rigorous oversight of all funds expended under this
24 program.
25 (17) The CSF shall not exclude, discriminate against, or otherwise disadvantage any

27 on the provider's religious character or affiliation, including religiously based or mission-based
