CONGRATULATING THE MATUNUCK OYSTER BAR ON BECOMING ONE OF USA
TODAY'S 2025 RESTAURANTS OF THE YEAR AND ON BEING AWARDED WINE
SPECTATOR’S TWO-GLASS BEST OF AWARD OF EXCELLENCE
Introduced By: Senators Sosnowski, Valverde, Gu, and DiMario
Date Introduced: March 03, 2025
Referred To: Placed on the Senate Consent Calendar
1 WHEREAS, By delighting our palates and whetting our appetites with a winning “pond-
2 to-plate philosophy” and a vast selection of pairing wines, that are deliciously prepared with
3 creativity and served by courteous staff, the Matunuck Oyster Bar in South County has become
4 the cream of the crop, the best of the best, and they are a feather in the cap of Rhode Island’s
5 tourism industry and a boost to our State’s economy; and
6 WHEREAS, USA Today's 2025 Restaurants of the Year list and Wine Spectator’s two-
7 glass Best of Award of Excellence have now declared what most Rhode Islanders already knew
8 by recognizing this epicurean and wine connoisseur treasure; and
9 WHEREAS, Through nominations from food writers across the country, USA Today
10 whittled down the vast competition to designate the top 45 places to eat in America, and awarded
11 owner Perry Raso's Matunuck Oyster Bar with this prestigious honor; and
12 WHEREAS, Considered a “hidden gem” oysters at the Farm, which was founded in
13 2002, are grown and harvested on picturesque Potter Pond in East Matunuck, under Perry Raso's
14 watchful eye, and with the knowledge he gained with a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree from the
15 University of Rhode Island in aquaculture and fisheries technology; and
16 WHEREAS, In addition, only 1,531 restaurants across the country earned the designation
17 as “The Best of Award of Excellence” from Wine Spectator. The Matunuck Oyster Farm earned
18 their spot in recognition of their extensive wine list which typically offers 350 or more selections;
19 and

1 WHEREAS, Not resting on his laurels, Perry Raso has now developed the Matunuck
2 Vegetable Farm, producing fresh greens and veggies for the Oyster Bar and has received state
3 approval for a scallop farm to continue to expand and create a sustainable restaurant footprint;
4 and
5 WHEREAS, Matunuck Oyster Bar is already the favorite spot to eat and drink, and in the
6 summer, sitting on the roof deck or airy patio with water views, watching the oysters being
7 cleaned on the dock, or inside at the hundred or so tables or beautiful bar, is surely a treat to all
8 the senses and eminently worthy of the awards they have earned; now, therefore be it
9 RESOLVED, That this Senate of the State of Rhode Island hereby congratulates Perry
10 Raso and the Matunuck Oyster Bar on earning their place on the USA Today's 2025 Restaurants
11 of the Year list and Wine Spectator’s two-glass Best of Award of Excellence. We moreover wish
12 Mr. Raso the very best in all his future endeavors; and be it further
13 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
14 transmit a duly certified copy of this resolution to Mr. Perry Raso.
