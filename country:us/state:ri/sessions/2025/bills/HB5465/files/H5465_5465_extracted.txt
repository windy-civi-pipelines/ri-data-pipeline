HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM
Introduced By: Representatives Morales, Potter, Tanzi, Batista, Stewart, Cruz, Handy,
and J. Lombardi
Date Introduced: February 12, 2025
Referred To: House Finance
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Title 23 of the General Laws entitled "HEALTH AND SAFETY" is hereby
2 amended by adding thereto the following chapter:
3 CHAPTER 104
4 THE RHODE ISLAND COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM
5 23-104-1. Legislative findings.
6 (1) Health care is a human right, not a commodity available only to those who can afford
7 it;
8 (2) Although the federal Affordable Care Act (ACA) allowed states to offer more people
9 taxpayer subsidized private health insurance, the ACA has not provided universal, comprehensive,
10 affordable coverage for all Rhode Islanders:
11 (i) In 2019, about four and three-tenths percent (4.3%) of Rhode Islanders had no health
12 insurance, causing about forty-three (43) (1 per 1,000 uninsured) unnecessary deaths each year;
13 (ii) An estimated forty-five percent (45%) of Rhode Islanders are under-insured (e.g., not
14 seeking health care because of high deductibles and co-pays);
15 (3) COVID-19 exacerbated and highlighted problems with the status quo health insurance
16 system including:
17 (i) Coverage is too easily lost when health insurance is tied to jobs - between February and
18 May, 2020, about twenty-one thousand (21,000) more Rhode Islanders lost their jobs and their
1 health insurance;
2 (ii) Systemic racism is reinforced - Black and Hispanic/Latinx Rhode Islanders, are more
3 likely to be uninsured or underinsured, have suffered the highest rates of COVID-19 mortality and
4 morbidity;
5 (iii) The fear of out-of-pocket costs for uninsured and underinsured puts everyone at risk
6 because they avoid testing and treatment;
7 (4) In 2016, sixty million (60,000,000) people separated from their job at some point during
8 the year (i.e., about forty-two percent (42%) of the American workforce) and although this act may
9 cause some job loss, on balance, single payer would increase employment in Rhode Island by nearly
10 three percent (3%);
11 (5) The existing US health insurance system has failed to control the cost of health care
12 and to provide universal access to health care in a system which is widely accepted to waste thirty
13 percent (30%) of its revenues on activities that do not improve the health of Americans;
14 (6) Every industrialized nation in the world, except the United States, offers universal
15 health care to its citizens and enjoys better health outcomes for less than two thirds (2/3) to one-
16 half (1/2) the cost;
17 (7) Health care is rationed under our current multi-payer system, despite the fact that Rhode
18 Island patients, businesses and taxpayers already pay enough to have comprehensive and universal
19 health insurance under a single-payer system;
20 (8) About one-third (1/3) of every "healthcare" dollar spent in the U.S. is wasted on
21 unnecessary administrative costs and excessive pharmaceutical company profits due to laws
22 preventing Medicare from negotiating prices and private health insurance companies lacking
23 adequate market share to effectively negotiate prices;
24 (9) Private health insurance companies are incentivized to let the cost of health care rise
25 because higher costs require health insurance companies to charge higher health insurance
26 premiums, increasing companies' revenue and stock price;
27 (10) The healthcare marketplace is not an efficient market and because it represents only
28 eighteen percent (18%) of the US domestic market, significantly restricts economic growth and
29 thus the financial well-being of every American, including every Rhode Islander;
30 (11) Rhode Islanders cannot afford to keep the current multi-payer health insurance system:
31 (i) Between 1991 and 2014, healthcare spending in Rhode Island per person rose by over
32 two hundred fifty percent (250%) rising much faster than income and greatly reducing disposable
33 income;
34 (ii) It is estimated that by 2025, the cost of health insurance for an average family of four
LC001571 - Page 2 of 93
1 (4) will equal about one-half (1/2) of their annual income;
2 (iii) In the U.S., about two-thirds (2/3) of personal bankruptcies are medical cost-related
3 and of these, about three-fourths (3/4) had health insurance at the onset of their medical problems.
4 In no other industrialized country do people worry about going bankrupt over medical costs;
5 (12) Rhode Island private businesses bear most of the costs of employee health insurance
6 coverage and spend significant time and money choosing from a confusing array of increasingly
7 expensive plans which do not provide comprehensive coverage;
8 (13) Rhode Island employees and retirees lose significant wages and pensions as they are
9 forced to pay higher amounts of health insurance and healthcare costs;
10 (14) Rhode Island's hospitals are under increasing financial distress i.e., closing, sold to
11 out-of-state entities, attempting mergers largely due to health insurance reimbursement problems
12 that other nations do not face and are fixed by a single-payer system;
13 (15) The state and its municipalities face enormous other post-employment benefits
14 (OPEB) unfunded liabilities due mostly to health insurance costs;
15 (16) An improved Medicare-for-all style single-payer program would, based on the
16 performance of existing Medicare, eliminate fifty percent (50%) of the administrative waste in the
17 current system of private insurance before other savings achieved through meaningful negotiation
18 of prices and other savings are considered;
19 (17) The high costs of medical care could be lowered significantly if the state could
20 negotiate on behalf of all its residents for bulk purchasing, as well as gain access to usage and price
21 information currently kept confidential by private health insurers as "proprietary information;"
22 (18) Single payer health care would establish a true "free market" system where doctors
23 compete for patients rather than health insurance companies dictating which patients are able to see
24 which doctors and setting reimbursement rates;
25 (19) Healthcare providers would spend significantly less time with administrative work
26 caused by multiple health insurance company requirements and barriers to care delivery and would
27 spend significantly less for overhead costs because of streamlined billing;
28 (20) Rhode Island must act because there are currently no effective state or federal laws
29 that can provide universal coverage and adequately control rising premiums, co-pays, deductibles
30 and medical costs, or prevent private insurance companies from continuing to limit available
31 providers and coverage;
32 (21) In 1962, Canada's successful single-payer program began in the province of
33 Saskatchewan (with approximately the same population as Rhode Island) and became a national
34 program within ten (10) years; and
LC001571 - Page 3 of 93
1 (22) The proposed Rhode Island single payer program was studied by Professor Gerald
2 Friedman at UMass Amherst in 2015 and he concluded that:
3 "Single-payer in Rhode Island will finance medical care with substantial savings compared
4 with the existing multi-payer system of public and private insurers and would improve access to
5 health care by extending coverage to the four percent (4%) of Rhode Island residents still without
6 insurance under the Affordable Care Act and expanding coverage for the growing number with
7 inadequate healthcare coverage. Single-payer would improve the economic health of Rhode Island
8 by: increasing real disposable income for most residents; reducing the burden of health care on
9 businesses and promoting increased employment; and shifting the costs of health care away from
10 working and middle-class residents."
11 23-104-2. Legislative purpose.
12 It is the intent of the general assembly that this chapter establish a universal,
13 comprehensive, affordable single-payer healthcare insurance program that will help control
14 healthcare costs which shall be referred to as, "the Rhode Island comprehensive health insurance
15 program" (RICHIP). The program will be paid for by consolidating government and private
16 payments to multiple insurance carriers into a more economical and efficient improved Medicare-
17 for-all style single-payer program and substituting lower progressive taxes for higher health
18 insurance premiums, co-pays, deductibles and costs in excess of caps. This program will save
19 Rhode Islanders from the current overly expensive, inefficient and unsustainable multi-payer health
20 insurance system that unnecessarily prevents access to medically necessary health care. The
21 program will be established after the standard of care funded by Medicaid has been raised to a
22 Medicare standard.

33 shall become the equivalent of qualifying coverage under Medicare part D and Medicare advantage
34 programs, and as such shall be the vendor for coverage to RICHIP participants. RICHIP shall
LC001571 - Page 8 of 93
1 provide Medicare eligible residents benefits equal to those available to all other RICHIP

3 streamline the process, RICHIP shall seek to receive federal reimbursements for services and goods
4 to Medicare eligible residents and administer all Medicare funds.
5 (2) If all necessary federal waivers are obtained, RICHIP shall become the state's sole

7 eligible for Medicaid ("Medicaid eligible residents") in the federal Medicaid program to ensure a
8 maximum amount of federal Medicaid funds go to the RICHIP trust fund. RICHIP shall provide
9 benefits to Medicaid eligible residents equal to those available to all other RICHIP participants.
10 (3) If all necessary federal waivers are not granted from the Medicaid or Medicare
11 programs operated under Title XVIII or XIX of the Social Security Act, the Medicaid or Medicare
12 program for which a waiver is not granted shall act as the primary insurer for those eligible for such
13 coverage, and RICHIP shall serve as the secondary or supplemental plan of health insurance
14 coverage. Until such time as a waiver is granted, the plan shall not pay for services for persons
15 otherwise eligible for the same healthcare benefits under the Medicaid or Medicare program. The
16 director shall establish procedures for determining amounts owed by Medicare and Medicaid
17 eligible residents for supplemental RICHIP coverage and the extent of such coverage.
18 (4) The director may require Rhode Island residents to provide information necessary to
19 determine whether the resident is eligible for a federally matched public health program or for
20 Medicare, or any program or benefit under Medicare.
21 (5) As a condition of eligibility or continued eligibility for healthcare services under
22 RICHIP, a qualified Rhode Island resident who is eligible for benefits under Medicare shall enroll
23 in Medicare, including Parts A, B, and D.
24 (c) Veterans. RICHIP shall serve as the secondary or supplemental plan of health insurance
25 coverage for military veterans. The director shall establish procedures for determining amounts
26 owed by military veterans who are qualified residents for such supplemental RICHIP coverage and
27 the extent of such coverage.
28 (d) This chapter does not create any employment benefit, nor require, prohibit, or limit the
29 providing of any employment benefit.
30 (e) This chapter does not affect or limit collective action or collective bargaining on the
31 part of a healthcare provider with their employer or any other lawful collective action or collective
32 bargaining.
33 23-104-6. Benefits.
34 (a) This chapter shall provide insurance coverage for services and goods (including
LC001571 - Page 9 of 93

LC001571 - Page 11 of 93
1 (3) For-profit providers. For-profit providers may continue to offer services and goods in

3 for covered services and goods and shall notify qualified Rhode Island residents when the services
4 and goods they offer will not be reimbursed fully under RICHIP.
5 (b) Out-of-state providers. Except for emergency and urgently needed service, as set forth
6 in § 23-104-7(d), RICHIP shall not pay for healthcare services obtained outside of Rhode Island
7 unless the following requirements are met:
8 (1) The out-of-state provider agrees to accept the RICHIP rate for out-of-state providers;
9 and
10 (2) The services are medically necessary care.
11 (c) Out-of-state provider reimbursement. The program shall pay out-of-state healthcare
12 providers at a rate equal to the average rate paid by commercial insurers or Medicare for the services
13 rendered, whichever is higher.
14 (d) Out-of-state residents.
15 (1) In general. Rhode Island providers who provide any services to individuals who are not
16 RICHIP participants shall not be reimbursed by RICHIP and shall seek reimbursement from those
17 individuals or other sources.
18 (2) Emergency care exception. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent any individual from
19 receiving or any provider from providing emergency healthcare services and goods in Rhode
20 Island. The director shall adopt rules to provide reimbursement; however, the rules shall reasonably
21 limit reimbursement to protect the fiscal integrity of RICHIP. The director shall implement
22 procedures to secure reimbursement from any appropriate third-party funding source or from the
23 individual to whom the emergency services were rendered.
24 23-104-8. Cross border employees.
25 (a) State residents employed out-of-state. If an individual is employed out-of-state by an
26 employer that is subject to Rhode Island state law, the employer and employee shall be required to
27 pay the payroll taxes as to that employee as if the employment were in the state. If an individual is
28 employed out-of-state by an employer that is not subject to Rhode Island state law, the employee
29 health coverage provided by the out-of-state employer to a resident working out-of-state shall serve
30 as the employee's primary plan of health coverage, and RICHIP shall serve as the employee's
31 secondary plan of health coverage. The director shall establish procedures for determining amounts
32 owed by residents employed out-of-state for such supplemental secondary RICHIP coverage and
33 the extent of such coverage.
34 (b) Out-of-state residents employed in the state. The payroll tax set forth in § 23-104-12(i)
LC001571 - Page 12 of 93
1 shall apply to any out-of-state resident who is employed or self-employed in the state. However,
2 such out-of-state residents shall be able to take a credit for amounts they spend on health benefits
3 for themselves that would otherwise be covered by RICHIP if the individual were a RICHIP
4 participant. The out-of-state resident's employer shall be able to take a credit against such payroll
5 taxes regardless of the form of the health benefit (e.g., health insurance, a self-insured plan, direct
6 services, or reimbursement for services), to ensure that the revenue proposal does not relate to
7 employment benefits in violation of the Federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act
8 ("ERISA") law. For non-employment-based spending by individuals, the credit shall be available
9 for and limited to spending for health coverage (not out-of-pocket health spending). The credit shall
10 be available without regard to how little is spent or how sparse the benefit. The credit may only be
11 taken against the payroll taxes set forth in § 23-104-12(i). Any excess amount may not be applied
12 to other tax liability. For employment-based health benefits, the credit shall be distributed between
13 the employer and employee in the same proportion as the spending by each for the benefit. The
14 employer and employee may each apply their respective portion of the credit to their respective
15 portion of the payroll taxes set forth in § 23-104-12(i). If any provision of this clause or any
16 application of it shall be ruled to violate ERISA, the provision or the application of it shall be null
17 and void and the ruling shall not affect any other provision or application of this section or this
18 chapter.
19 23-104-9. Provider reimbursement.
20 (a) Rates for services and goods. RICHIP reimbursement rates to providers shall be
21 determined by the RICHIP board. These rates shall be equal to or greater than the federal Medicare
22 rates available to Rhode Island qualified residents that are in effect at the time services and goods
23 are provided. For outpatient behavioral health services, the minimum rate shall equal one hundred
24 fifty percent (150%) of federal Medicare rates. If the director determines that there are no such
25 federal Medicare reimbursement rates, the director shall set the minimum rate. The director shall
26 review the rates at least annually, recommend changes to the board, and establish procedures by
27 which complaints about reimbursement rates may be reviewed by the board.
28 (b) Billing and payments. Providers shall submit billing for services to RICHIP participants
29 in the form of electronic invoices entered into RIFANS, the state's computerized financial system.
30 The director shall coordinate the manner of processing and payment with the office of accounts and
31 control and the RIFANS support team within the division of information technology. Payments
32 shall be made by check or electronic funds transfer in accordance with terms and procedures
33 coordinated by the director and the office of accounts and control and consistent with the fiduciary
34 management of the RICHIP trust fund.
LC001571 - Page 13 of 93
1 (c) Provider restrictions. In-state providers who accept any payment from RICHIP shall
2 not bill any patient for any covered benefit. In-state providers cannot use any of their operating
3 budgets for expansion, profit, excessive executive income, including bonuses, marketing, or major
4 capital purchases or leases.
5 23-104-10. Private insurance companies.
6 (a) Non-duplication. It is unlawful for a private health insurer to sell health insurance
7 coverage to qualified Rhode Island residents that duplicates the benefits provided under this
8 chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as prohibiting the sale of health insurance
9 coverage for any additional benefits not covered by this chapter, including additional benefits that
10 an employer may provide to employees or their dependents, or to former employees or their
11 dependents (e.g., multiemployer plans can continue to provide wrap-around coverage for any
12 benefits not provided by RICHIP).
13 (b) Displaced employees. Re-education and job placement of persons employed in Rhode
14 Island-located enterprises who have lost their jobs as a result of this chapter shall be managed by
15 the Rhode Island department of labor and training or an appropriate federal retraining program. The
16 director may provide funds from RICHIP or funds otherwise appropriated for this purpose for
17 retraining and assisting job transition for individuals employed or previously employed in the fields
18 of health insurance, healthcare service plans, and other third-party payments for health care or those
19 individuals providing services to healthcare providers to deal with third-party payers for health
20 care, whose jobs may be or have been ended as a result of the implementation of the program,
21 consistent with applicable laws.
22 23-104-11. Budgeting.
23 (a) Operating budget. Annually, the director shall create an operating budget for the
24 program that includes the costs for all benefits set forth in § 23-104-5 and the costs for RICHIP
25 administration. The director shall determine appropriate reimbursement rates for benefits pursuant
26 to § 23-104-9(a). The operating budget shall be approved by the executive board prior to
27 submission to the governor and general assembly.
28 (b) Capital expenditures. The director shall work with representatives from state entities
29 involved with provider capital expenditures (e.g., the Rhode Island department of administration
30 office of capital projects, the Rhode Island health and educational building corporation, etc.), and
31 providers to help ensure that capital expenditures proposed by providers, including amounts to be
32 spent on construction and renovation of health facilities and major equipment purchases, will
33 address healthcare needs of RICHIP participants. To the extent that providers are seeking to use
34 RICHIP funds for capital expenditures, the director shall have the authority to approve or deny such
LC001571 - Page 14 of 93
1 expenditures.
2 (c) Prohibition against co-mingling operations and capital improvement funds. It is
3 prohibited to use funds under this chapter that are earmarked:
4 (1) For operations for capital expenditures; or
5 (2) For capital expenditures for operations.
6 23-104-12. Financing.
7 (a) RICHIP trust fund. There shall be established a RICHIP trust fund into which funds
8 collected pursuant to this chapter are deposited and from which funds are distributed. All money
9 collected and received shall be used exclusively to finance RICHIP. The governor or general
10 assembly may provide funds to the RICHIP trust fund, but may not remove or borrow funds from
11 the RICHIP trust fund.
12 (b) Revenue proposal. After approval of the RICHIP executive board, the director shall
13 submit to the governor and the general assembly a revenue plan and, if required, legislation
14 (referred to collectively in this section as the "revenue proposal") to provide the revenue necessary
15 to finance RICHIP. The initial revenue proposal shall be submitted once waiver negotiations have
16 proceeded to a level deemed sufficient by the director and annually, thereafter. The basic structure
17 of the initial revenue proposal will be based on a consideration of:
18 (1) Anticipated savings from a single payer program;
19 (2) Government funds available for health care;
20 (3) Private funds available for health care; and
21 (4) Replacing current regressive health insurance payments made to multiple health
22 insurance carriers with progressive contributions to a single payer (RICHIP) in order to make
23 healthcare insurance affordable and remove unnecessary barriers to healthcare access.
24 Subsequent proposals shall adjust the RICHIP contributions, based on projections from the
25 total RICHIP costs in the previous year, and shall include a five (5) year plan for adjusting RICHIP
26 contributions to best meet the goals set forth in this section and § 23-104-2.
27 (c) Anticipated savings. It is anticipated that RICHIP will lower healthcare costs by:
28 (1) Eliminating payments to private health insurance carriers;
29 (2) Reducing paperwork and administrative expenses for both providers and payers created
30 by the marketing, sales, eligibility checks, network contract management, issues associated
31 multiple benefit packages, and other administrative waste associated with the current multi-payer
32 private health insurance system;
33 (3) Allowing the planning and delivery of a public health strategy for the entire population
34 of Rhode Island;
LC001571 - Page 15 of 93
1 (4) Improving access to preventive healthcare; and
2 (5) Negotiating on behalf of the state for bulk purchasing of medical supplies and
3 pharmaceuticals.
4 (d) Federal funds. The executive office of health and human services, in collaboration with
5 the director, the board and the Medicaid office, shall seek and obtain waivers and other approvals
6 relating to Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program, Medicare, federal tax exemptions
7 for health care, the ACA, and any other relevant federal programs in order that:
8 (1) Federal funds and other subsidies for health care that would otherwise be paid to the
9 state and its residents and healthcare providers, would be paid by the federal government to the
10 state and deposited into the RICHIP trust fund;
11 (2) Programs would be waived and such funding from federal programs in Rhode Island
12 would be replaced or merged into RICHIP in order that it can operate as a single payer program;
13 (3) Maximum federal funding for health care is sought even if any necessary waivers or
14 approvals are not obtained and multiple sources of funding with RICHIP trust fund monies are
15 pooled, in order that RICHIP can act as much as possible like a single payer program to maximize
16 benefits to Rhode Islanders; and
17 (4) Federal financial participation in the programs that are incorporated into RICHIP are
18 not jeopardized.
19 (e) State funds. State funds that would otherwise be appropriated to any governmental
20 agency, office, program, instrumentality, or institution for services and benefits covered under
21 RICHIP shall be directed into the RICHIP trust fund. Payments to the fund pursuant to this section
22 shall be in an amount equal to the money appropriated for those purposes in the fiscal year
23 beginning immediately preceding the effective date of this chapter.
24 (f) Private funds. Private grants (e.g., from nonprofit corporations) and other funds
25 specifically ear-marked for health care (e.g., from litigation against tobacco companies, opioid
26 manufacturers, etc.), shall also be put into the RICHIP trust fund.
27 (g) Assignments from RICHIP participants. Receipt of healthcare services under the plan
28 shall be deemed an assignment by the RICHIP participant of any right to payment for services from
29 a policy of insurance, a health benefit plan or other source. The other source of healthcare benefits
30 shall pay to the fund all amounts it is obligated to pay to, or on behalf of, the RICHIP participant
31 for covered healthcare services. The director may commence any action necessary to recover the
32 amounts due.
33 (h) Replacing current health insurance payments with progressive contributions. Instead of
34 making health insurance payments to multiple carriers (i.e., for premiums, co-pays deductibles, and
LC001571 - Page 16 of 93
1 costs in excess of caps) for limited coverage, individuals and entities subject to Rhode Island
2 taxation pursuant to § 44-30-1 shall pay progressive contributions to the RICHIP trust fund
3 (referred to collectively in this section as the "RICHIP contributions") for comprehensive coverage.
4 These RICHIP contributions shall be set and adjusted over time to an appropriate level to:
5 (1) Cover the actual cost of the program;
6 (2) Ensure that higher brackets of income subject to specified taxes shall be assessed at a
7 higher marginal rate than lower brackets; and
8 (3) Protect the economic welfare of small businesses, low-income earners and working
9 families through tax credits or exemptions.
10 (i) Contributions based on earned income. The amounts currently paid by employers and
11 employees for health insurance shall initially be replaced by a ten percent (10%) payroll tax, based
12 on the projected average payroll of employees over three (3) previous calendar years. The employer
13 shall pay eighty percent (80%) and the employee shall pay twenty percent (20%) of this payroll
14 tax, except that an employer may agree to pay all or part of the employee's share. Self- employed
15 individuals shall initially pay one-hundred percent (100%) of the payroll tax. The ten percent (10%)
16 initial rate will be adjusted by the director in order that higher brackets of income subject to these
17 taxes shall be assessed at a higher marginal rate than lower brackets and in order that small
18 businesses and lower income earners receive a credit or exemption.
19 (j) Contributions based on unearned income. There shall be a progressive contribution
20 based on unearned income, i.e., capital gains, dividends, interest, profits, and rents. Initially, the
21 unearned income RICHIP contributions shall be equal to ten percent (10%) of such unearned
22 income. The ten percent (10%) initial rate may be adjusted by the director to allow for a graduated
23 progressive exemption or credit for individuals with lower unearned income levels.
24 23-104-13. Implementation.
25 (a) State laws and regulations.
26 (1) In general. The director shall work with the executive board and receive such assistance
27 as may be necessary from other state agencies and entities to examine state laws and regulations
28 and to make recommendations necessary to conform such laws and regulations to properly
29 implement the RICHIP program. The director shall report recommendations to the governor and
30 the general assembly.
31 (2) Anti-trust laws. The intent of this chapter is to exempt activities provided for under this
32 chapter from state antitrust laws and to provide immunity from federal antitrust laws through the
33 state action doctrine.
34 (b) The director shall complete an implementation plan to provide healthcare coverage for
LC001571 - Page 17 of 93
1 qualified residents in accordance with this chapter within twelve (12) months of its effective date.
2 (c) The executive office of health and human services, in collaboration with the director,
3 the board, and the Medicaid director, will have the initial responsibility of negotiating the waivers.
4 (d) Severability. If any provision or application of this chapter shall be held to be invalid,
5 or to violate or be inconsistent with any applicable federal law or regulation, that shall not affect
6 other provisions or applications of this chapter which can be given effect without that provision or
7 application; and to that end, the provisions and applications of this chapter are severable.

9 Services" is hereby amended by adding thereto the following section:
10 22-11-4.1. Employees needed to maximize federal Medicaid funding.

20 SECTION 6. Section 28-57-5 of the General Laws in Chapter 28-57 entitled "Healthy and
21 Safe Families and Workplaces Act" is hereby amended to read as follows:
22 28-57-5. Accrual of paid sick and safe leave time.

24 Island shall accrue a minimum of one hour of paid sick and safe leave time for every thirty five
25 (35) hours worked up to a maximum of twenty-four (24) hours during calendar year 2018, thirty-
26 two (32) hours during calendar year 2019, and up to a maximum of forty (40) hours per year from
27 calendar year 2020 through calendar year 2026, and one hundred sixty (160) hours per year
28 thereafter, unless the employer chooses to provide a higher annual limit in both accrual and use. In
29 determining the number of employees who are employed by an employer for compensation, all
30 employees defined in § 28-57-3(7) shall be counted.
31 (b) Employees who are exempt from the overtime requirements under 29 U.S.C. §
32 213(a)(1) of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. § 201 et seq., will be assumed to work
33 forty (40) hours in each workweek for purposes of paid sick and safe leave time accrual unless their
34 normal workweek is less than forty (40) hours, in which case paid sick and safe leave time accrues

2 (c) Paid sick and safe leave time as provided in this chapter shall begin to accrue at the
3 commencement of employment or pursuant to the law’s effective date [July 1, 2018], whichever is

5 accrue in a year at the beginning of the year.
6 (d) An employer may require a waiting period for newly hired employees of up to ninety
7 (90) days. During this waiting period, an employee shall accrue earned sick time pursuant to this
8 section or the employer’s policy, if exempt under § 28-57-4(b), but shall not be permitted to use
9 the earned sick time until after he or she has completed the waiting period.
10 (e) Paid sick and safe leave time shall be carried over to the following calendar year;
11 however, an employee’s use of paid sick and safe leave time provided under this chapter in each
12 calendar year shall not exceed twenty-four (24) hours during calendar year 2018, and thirty-two
13 (32) hours during calendar year 2019, and forty (40) hours per year thereafter. Alternatively, in lieu
14 of carryover of unused earned paid sick and safe leave time from one year to the next, an employer
15 may pay an employee for unused earned paid sick and safe leave time at the end of a year and
16 provide the employee with an amount of paid sick and safe leave that meets or exceeds the
17 requirements of this chapter that is available for the employee’s immediate use at the beginning of
18 the subsequent year.
19 (f) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as requiring financial or other reimbursement
20 to an employee from an employer upon the employee’s termination, resignation, retirement, or
21 other separation from employment for accrued paid sick and safe leave time that has not been used.
22 (g) If an employee is transferred to a separate division, entity, or location within the state,
23 but remains employed by the same employer as defined in 29 C.F.R. § 791.2 of the federal Fair
24 Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. § 201 et seq., the employee is entitled to all paid sick and safe leave
25 time accrued at the prior division, entity, or location and is entitled to use all paid sick and safe
26 leave time as provided in this act. When there is a separation from employment and the employee
27 is rehired within one hundred thirty-five (135) days of separation by the same employer, previously
28 accrued paid sick and safe leave time that had not been used shall be reinstated. Further, the
29 employee shall be entitled to use accrued paid sick and safe leave time and accrue additional sick
30 and safe leave time at the re-commencement of employment.
31 (h) When a different employer succeeds or takes the place of an existing employer, all
32 employees of the original employer who remain employed by the successor employer within the
33 state are entitled to all earned paid sick and safe leave time they accrued when employed by the
34 original employer, and are entitled to use earned paid sick and safe leave time previously accrued.
LC001571 - Page 21 of 93
1 (i) At its discretion, an employer may loan sick and safe leave time to an employee in
2 advance of accrual by such employee.
3 (j) Temporary employees shall be entitled to use accrued paid sick and safe leave time
4 beginning on the one hundred eightieth (180) calendar day following commencement of their
5 employment, unless otherwise permitted by the employer. On and after the one hundred eightieth
6 (180) calendar day of employment, employees may use paid sick and safe leave time as it is
7 accrued. During this waiting period, an employee shall accrue earned sick time pursuant to this
8 chapter, but shall not be permitted to use the earned sick time until after he or she has completed
9 the waiting period.
10 (k) Seasonal employees shall be entitled to use accrued paid sick and safe leave time
11 beginning on the one hundred fiftieth (150) calendar day following commencement of their
12 employment, unless otherwise permitted by the employer. On and after the one hundred fiftieth
13 (150) calendar day of employment, employees may use paid sick and safe leave time as it is

1 40-8-13. Rules, regulations, and fee schedules.
2 The director shall make and promulgate rules, regulations, and fee schedules not
3 inconsistent with state law and fiscal procedures as he or she deems necessary for the proper

18 health insurers pursuant to chapter 17 of title 44 in the amount necessary to defray the costs of the
19 inability to obtain federal reimbursement for an outpatient behavioral health services rate of one
20 hundred fifty percent (150%) of the Medicare equivalent rate.
21 40-8-13.4. Rate methodology for payment for in-state and out-of-state hospital
22 services.
23 (a) The executive office of health and human services (“executive office”) shall implement
24 a new methodology for payment for in-state and out-of-state hospital services in order to ensure
25 access to, and the provision of, high-quality and cost-effective hospital care to its eligible recipients.
26 (b) In order to improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness, the executive office shall:
27 (1)(i) With respect to inpatient services for persons in fee-for-service Medicaid, which is
28 non-managed care, implement a new payment methodology for inpatient services utilizing the
29 Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) method of payment, which is, a patient-classification method
30 that provides a means of relating payment to the hospitals to the type of patients cared for by the
31 hospitals. It is understood that a payment method based on DRG may include cost outlier payments
32 and other specific exceptions. The executive office will review the DRG-payment method and the
33 DRG base price annually, making adjustments as appropriate in consideration of such elements as
34 trends in hospital input costs; patterns in hospital coding; beneficiary access to care; and the Centers
LC001571 - Page 25 of 93
1 for Medicare and Medicaid Services national CMS Prospective Payment System (IPPS) Hospital
2 Input Price Index. For the twelve-month (12) period beginning July 1, 2015, the DRG base rate for
3 Medicaid fee-for-service inpatient hospital services shall not exceed ninety-seven and one-half
4 percent (97.5%) of the payment rates in effect as of July 1, 2014. Beginning July 1, 2019, the DRG
5 base rate for Medicaid fee-for-service inpatient hospital services shall be 107.2% of the payment
6 rates in effect as of July 1, 2018. Increases in the Medicaid fee-for-service DRG hospital payments
7 for the twelve-month (12) period beginning July 1, 2020, shall be based on the payment rates in
8 effect as of July 1 of the preceding fiscal year, and shall be the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
9 Services national Prospective Payment System (IPPS) Hospital Input Price Index. Beginning July
10 1, 2022, the DRG base rate for Medicaid fee-for-service inpatient hospital services shall be one
11 hundred five percent (105%) of the payment rates in effect as of July 1, 2021. Increases in the
12 Medicaid fee-for-service DRG hospital payments for each annual twelve-month (12) period
13 beginning July 1, 2023, shall be based on the payment rates in effect as of July 1 of the preceding
14 fiscal year, and shall be the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services national Prospective
15 Payment System (IPPS) Hospital Input Price Index. Beginning July 1, 2025, payments for inpatient
16 services in fee-for-service Medicaid shall cease utilizing the DRG method of payment, and
17 payments shall take place on a pure fee-for-services basis, unless a provider shall elect to utilize
18 the DRG payment methodology. DRG rates shall be set equal to ninety percent (90%) of a
19 reasonable estimate of the Medicare equivalent rate. Non-DRG rates shall be set by the Medicaid
20 director through regulation in order that the projected overall per capita expenditures shall equal
21 ninety-five percent (95%) of a reasonable estimate of the equivalent overall per capital expenditures
22 that would have been reached under the Medicare equivalent rate.

26 30, 2010. Increases in inpatient hospital payments for each annual twelve-month (12) period
27 beginning January 1, 2012, may not exceed the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
28 national CMS Prospective Payment System (IPPS) Hospital Input Price Index for the applicable
29 period; (B) Provided, however, for the twenty-four-month (24) period beginning July 1, 2013, the
30 Medicaid managed care payment rates between each hospital and health plan shall not exceed the
31 payment rates in effect as of January 1, 2013, and for the twelve-month (12) period beginning July

13 Medicaid program through reduced managed care plan payments and shall not be retained by the
14 managed care plans; (F) Beginning July 1, 2022, the Medicaid managed care payment inpatient
15 rates between each hospital and health plan shall be one hundred five percent (105%) of the
16 payment rates in effect as of January 1, 2022, and shall be paid to each hospital retroactively to July
17 1 within ninety days of passage; (G) Increases in inpatient hospital payments for each annual
18 twelve-month (12) period beginning July 1, 2023, shall be based on the payment rates in effect as
19 of January 1 of the preceding fiscal year, and shall be the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
20 Services national CMS Prospective Payment System (IPPS) Hospital Input Price Index, less
21 Productivity Adjustment, for the applicable period and shall be paid to each hospital retroactively
22 to July 1 within ninety days of passage; (H) All hospitals licensed in Rhode Island shall accept such
23 payment rates as payment in full; and (I) For all such hospitals, compliance with the provisions of
24 this section shall be a condition of participation in the Rhode Island Medicaid program. Beginning

30 in accordance with federal regulations. Fee-for-service outpatient rates shall align with Medicare
31 payments for similar services. Notwithstanding the above, there shall be no increase in the
32 Medicaid fee-for-service outpatient rates effective on July 1, 2013, July 1, 2014, or July 1, 2015.
33 For the twelve-month (12) period beginning July 1, 2015, Medicaid fee-for-service outpatient rates
34 shall not exceed ninety-seven and one-half percent (97.5%) of the rates in effect as of July 1, 2014.
LC001571 - Page 27 of 93
1 Increases in the outpatient hospital payments for the twelve-month (12) period beginning July 1,
2 2016, may not exceed the CMS national Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) Hospital

18 Hospital Price Index for the applicable period; (iii) Provided, however, for the twenty-four-month
19 (24) period beginning July 1, 2013, the Medicaid managed care outpatient payment rates between
20 each hospital and health plan shall not exceed the payment rates in effect as of January 1, 2013,

19 rates between the court-approved purchaser and the health plan, and such rates shall be effective as
20 of the date that the court-approved purchaser and the health plan execute the initial agreement
21 containing the new rates. The rate-setting methodology for inpatient-hospital payments and
22 outpatient-hospital payments set forth in subsections (b)(1)(ii)(C) and (b)(2), respectively, shall
23 thereafter apply to increases for each annual twelve-month (12) period as of July 1 following the

28 opportunity to conduct value-based purchasing of inpatient care.
29 (d) The secretary of the executive office is hereby authorized to promulgate such rules and
30 regulations consistent with this chapter, and to establish fiscal procedures he or she deems
31 necessary, for the proper implementation and administration of this chapter in order to provide
32 payment to hospitals using the DRG-payment methodology. Furthermore, amendment of the Rhode
33 Island state plan for Medicaid, pursuant to Title XIX of the federal Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.
34 § 1396 et seq., is hereby authorized to provide for payment to hospitals for services provided to
LC001571 - Page 29 of 93

3 implement these rate changes.
4 (f) As a condition of participation in the DRG methodology for payment of hospital
5 services, every hospital shall submit year-end settlement reports to the executive office within one
6 year from the close of a hospital’s fiscal year. Should a participating hospital fail to timely submit
7 a year-end settlement report as required by this section, the executive office shall withhold
8 financial-cycle payments due by any state agency with respect to this hospital by not more than ten
9 percent (10%) until the report is submitted. For hospital fiscal year 2010 and all subsequent fiscal
10 years, hospitals will not be required to submit year-end settlement reports on payments for
11 outpatient services. For hospital fiscal year 2011 and all subsequent fiscal years, hospitals will not
12 be required to submit year-end settlement reports on claims for hospital inpatient services. Further,
13 for hospital fiscal year 2010, hospital inpatient claims subject to settlement shall include only those
14 claims received between October 1, 2009, and June 30, 2010.
15 (g) The provisions of this section shall be effective upon implementation of the new
16 payment methodology set forth in this section and § 40-8-13.3, which shall in any event be no later

18 19-16 shall be repealed in their entirety.
19 40-8-16. Notification of long-term care alternative.
20 (a) The department of human services, before authorizing care in a nursing home or
21 intermediate-care facility for a person who is eligible to receive benefits pursuant to Title XIX of

23 hospital to a nursing home, shall notify the person, in writing, of the provisions of the long-term-
24 care alternative, a home- and a community-based program.
25 (b) If a person, eligible to receive benefits pursuant to Title XIX of the federal Social
26 Security Act, requires services in a nursing home and desires to remain in his or her own home or
27 the home of a responsible relative or other adult, the person or his or her representative shall so
28 inform the department.
29 (c) The department shall not make payments pursuant to Title XIX of the federal Social
30 Security Act for benefits until written notification documenting the person’s choice as to a nursing
31 home or home- and community-based services has been filed with the department.

2 Medicaid-eligible residents, shall be reasonable and adequate to meet the costs that must be
3 incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities in accordance with 42 U.S.C. §
4 1396a(a)(13). The executive office of health and human services (“executive office”) shall
5 promulgate or modify the principles of reimbursement for nursing facilities in effect as of July 1,
6 2011, to be consistent with the provisions of this section and Title XIX, 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq.,
7 of the Social Security Act.
8 (2) The executive office shall review the current methodology for providing Medicaid
9 payments to nursing facilities, including other long-term care services providers, and is authorized
10 to modify the principles of reimbursement to replace the current cost-based methodology rates with
11 rates based on a price-based methodology to be paid to all facilities with recognition of the acuity
12 of patients and the relative Medicaid occupancy, and to include the following elements to be
13 developed by the executive office:
14 (i) A direct-care rate adjusted for resident acuity;
15 (ii) An indirect-care and other direct-care rate comprised of a base per diem for all facilities;
16 (iii) Revision of rates as necessary based on increases in direct and indirect costs beginning
17 October 2024 utilizing data from the most recent finalized year of facility cost report. The per diem
18 rate components deferred in subsections (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(ii) of this section shall be adjusted
19 accordingly to reflect changes in direct and indirect care costs since the previous rate review;
20 (iv) Application of a fair-rental value system;
21 (v) Application of a pass-through system; and
22 (vi) Adjustment of rates by the change in a recognized national nursing home inflation

27 by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and in effect on October 1, 2017, both fee-for-
28 service and managed care, will be increased by one and one-half percent (1.5%) and further
29 increased by one percent (1%) on October 1, 2018, and further increased by one percent (1%) on
30 October 1, 2019. Effective October 1, 2022, rates paid to nursing facilities from the rates approved
31 by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and in effect on October 1, 2021, both fee-for-

34 (0.5%) on October 1, 2021, one percent (1.0%) on October 1, 2022, and one and one-half percent
LC001571 - Page 31 of 93
1 (1.5%) on October 1, 2023. The inflation index shall be applied without regard for the transition
2 factors in subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2). For purposes of October 1, 2016, adjustment only, any rate

12 technicians, RNs, or LPNs who are contracted, or subcontracted, through a third-party vendor or
13 staffing agency. By July 31, 2017, nursing facilities shall submit to the secretary, or designee, a
14 certification that they have complied with the provisions of this subsection (a)(2)(vi) with respect
15 to the inflation index applied on October 1, 2016. Any facility that does not comply with the terms
16 of such certification shall be subjected to a clawback, paid by the nursing facility to the state, in the
17 amount of increased reimbursement subject to this provision that was not expended in compliance
18 with that certification.
19 (3) Commencing on October 1, 2021, eighty percent (80%) of any rate increase that results
20 from application of the inflation index to subsections (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(ii) of this section shall be
21 dedicated to increase compensation for all eligible direct-care workers in the following manner on
22 October 1, of each year.
23 (i) For purposes of this subsection, compensation increases shall include base salary or
24 hourly wage increases, benefits, other compensation, and associated payroll tax increases for
25 eligible direct-care workers. This application of the inflation index shall apply for Medicaid
26 reimbursement in nursing facilities for both managed care and fee-for-service. For purposes of this

2 subcontracted through a third-party vendor or staffing agency.
3 (4)(i) By July 31, 2021, and July 31 of each year thereafter, nursing facilities shall submit
4 to the secretary or designee a certification that they have complied with the provisions of subsection
5 (a)(3) of this section with respect to the inflation index applied on October 1. The executive office
6 of health and human services (EOHHS) shall create the certification form nursing facilities must
7 complete with information on how each individual eligible employee’s compensation increased,
8 including information regarding hourly wages prior to the increase and after the compensation
9 increase, hours paid after the compensation increase, and associated increased payroll taxes. A
10 collective bargaining agreement can be used in lieu of the certification form for represented
11 employees. All data reported on the compliance form is subject to review and audit by EOHHS.
12 The audits may include field or desk audits, and facilities may be required to provide additional
13 supporting documents including, but not limited to, payroll records.
14 (ii) Any facility that does not comply with the terms of certification shall be subjected to a
15 clawback and twenty-five percent (25%) penalty of the unspent or impermissibly spent funds, paid
16 by the nursing facility to the state, in the amount of increased reimbursement subject to this
17 provision that was not expended in compliance with that certification.
18 (iii) In any calendar year where no inflationary index is applied, eighty percent (80%) of
19 the base rate staffing adjustment in that calendar year pursuant to subsection (a)(2)(vi) of this
20 section shall be dedicated to increase compensation for all eligible direct-care workers in the
21 manner referenced in subsections (a)(3)(i), (a)(3)(i)(A), and (a)(3)(i)(B) of this section.
22 (b) Transition to full implementation of rate reform. For no less than four (4) years after
23 the initial application of the price-based methodology described in subsection (a)(2) to payment
24 rates, the executive office of health and human services shall implement a transition plan to
25 moderate the impact of the rate reform on individual nursing facilities. The transition shall include
26 the following components:
27 (1) No nursing facility shall receive reimbursement for direct-care costs that is less than
28 the rate of reimbursement for direct-care costs received under the methodology in effect at the time
29 of passage of this act; for the year beginning October 1, 2017, the reimbursement for direct-care
30 costs under this provision will be phased out in twenty-five-percent (25%) increments each year
31 until October 1, 2021, when the reimbursement will no longer be in effect; and
32 (2) No facility shall lose or gain more than five dollars ($5.00) in its total, per diem rate the
33 first year of the transition. An adjustment to the per diem loss or gain may be phased out by twenty-
34 five percent (25%) each year; except, however, for the years beginning October 1, 2015, there shall
LC001571 - Page 33 of 93
1 be no adjustment to the per diem gain or loss, but the phase out shall resume thereafter; and
2 (3) The transition plan and/or period may be modified upon full implementation of facility
3 per diem rate increases for quality of care-related measures. Said modifications shall be submitted
4 in a report to the general assembly at least six (6) months prior to implementation.
5 (4) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, for the twelve-month (12) period beginning
6 July 1, 2015, Medicaid payment rates for nursing facilities established pursuant to this section shall
7 not exceed ninety-eight percent (98%) of the rates in effect on April 1, 2015. Consistent with the
8 other provisions of this chapter, nothing in this provision shall require the executive office to restore
9 the rates to those in effect on April 1, 2015, at the end of this twelve-month (12) period.
10 (5) Commencing July 1, 2025, and for each subsequent year, the executive office of health
11 and human services is hereby authorized and directed to amend its regulations for reimbursement
12 to nursing facilities in order that each nursing facility shall be paid the Medicare equivalent rate.
13 The provisions of subsection (a)(3)(iii) shall apply.
14 40-8-26. Community health centers.
15 (a) For the purposes of this section, the term community health centers refers to federally
16 qualified health centers and rural health centers.
17 (b) To support the ability of community health centers to provide high-quality medical care
18 to patients, the executive office of health and human services (“executive office”) may adopt and
19 implement an alternative payment methodology (APM) for determining a Medicaid per-visit
20 reimbursement for community health centers that is compliant with the prospective payment system
21 (PPS) provided for in the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection
22 Act of 2000. The following principles are to ensure that the APM PPS rate determination
23 methodology is part of the executive office overall value purchasing approach. For community
24 health centers that do not agree to the principles of reimbursement that reflect the APM PPS,
25 EOHHS shall reimburse such community health centers at the federal PPS rate, as required per
26 section 1902(bb)(3) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(bb)(3). For community health
27 centers that are reimbursed at the federal PPS rate, subsections (d) through (f) of this section apply.
28 (c) The APM PPS rate determination methodology will (i) Fairly recognize the reasonable
29 costs of providing services. Recognized reasonable costs will be those appropriate for the
30 organization, management, and direct provision of services and (ii) Provide assurances to the
31 executive office that services are provided in an effective and efficient manner, consistent with
32 industry standards. Except for demonstrated cause and at the discretion of the executive office, the
33 maximum reimbursement rate for a service (e.g., medical, dental) provided by an individual
34 community health center shall not exceed one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the median
LC001571 - Page 34 of 93
1 rate for all community health centers within Rhode Island. not only bill the community health center
2 on a fee-for-service basis at the Medicare equivalent rate but also make a series of quality incentive
3 payments if the community health center meets certain quality incentives. Quality incentive
4 payments shall be set at a percentage of the aggregate monthly billing. The quality incentive
5 payments shall be as follows:
6 (1) Ten percent (10%) for meeting benchmarks set by the Medicaid director for screening
7 patients for Medicaid eligibility.
8 (2) Five percent (5%) for meeting benchmarks set by the Medicaid director for enrolling
9 patients who regularly smoke tobacco in smoking cessation programs.
10 (3) Ten percent (10%) for meeting benchmarks set by the director of human services for
11 screening patients for supplemental nutrition assistance program eligibility.
12 (4) Ten percent (10%) for ensuring that no more than one percent (1%) of patients are ever
13 not offered an appointment within a month if they request one.
14 (5) Up to fifteen percent (15%) for meeting benchmarks set by the Medicaid director for
15 the improvement of air quality in patients' homes through directly funding interventions such as:
16 air quality inspections, the installation of air filters, the installation of ventilation, and the
17 replacement of gas stoves with electric stoves.
18 (6) Up to fifteen percent (15%) for meeting benchmarks set by the Medicaid director for
19 the removal or mitigation of environmental toxins in patients' homes through the direct funding of
20 removal or mitigation of environmental toxins. These toxins shall include, but shall not be limited
21 to, lead, radon, asbestos, and carbon monoxide.
22 (d) Community health centers will cooperate fully and timely with reporting requirements
23 established by the executive office.
24 (e) Reimbursement rates established through this methodology shall be incorporated into
25 the PPS reconciliation for services provided to Medicaid-eligible persons who are enrolled in a
26 health plan on the date of service. Monthly payments by the executive office related to PPS for
27 persons enrolled in a health plan shall be made directly to the community health centers.
28 (f) Reimbursement rates established through this the APM methodology shall not be
29 incorporated into the actuarially certified capitation rates paid to a health plan. The health plan shall
30 be responsible for paying the full amount of the reimbursement rate to the community health center
31 for each service eligible for reimbursement under the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits
32 Improvement and Protection Act of 2000. If the health plan has an alternative payment arrangement
33 with the community health center opts to utilize the APM methodology, the health plan may
34 establish a PPS reconciliation process for eligible services and make monthly payments related to
LC001571 - Page 35 of 93
1 PPS for persons enrolled in the health plan on the date of service shall bear the full upside and
2 downside risk of decreased or increased costs from the APM methodology. The executive office
3 will review, at least annually, the Medicaid reimbursement rates and reconciliation methodology
4 used by the health plans for community health centers to ensure payments to each are made in
5 compliance with the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of
6 2000.
7 40-8-32. Support for certain patients of nursing facilities.
8 (a) Definitions. For purposes of this section:

10 to contribute to the cost of his or her care.
11 (2) “Authorized individual” shall mean a person who has authority over the income of a
12 patient of a nursing facility, such as a person who has been given or has otherwise obtained

14 or is a fiduciary as defined below.
15 (3) “Costs of care” shall mean the costs of providing care to a patient of a nursing facility,
16 including nursing care, personal care, meals, transportation, and any other costs, charges, and
17 expenses incurred by a nursing facility in providing care to a patient. Costs of care shall not exceed
18 the customary rate the nursing facility charges to a patient who pays for his or her care directly
19 rather than through a governmental or other third-party payor.
20 (4) “Fiduciary” shall mean a person to whom power or property has been formally
21 entrusted for the benefit of another, such as an attorney-in-fact, legal guardian, trustee, or
22 representative payee.
23 (5) “Nursing facility” shall mean a nursing facility licensed under chapter 17 of title 23,
24 that is a participating provider in the Rhode Island Medicaid program.
25 (6) “Penalty period” means the period of Medicaid ineligibility imposed pursuant to 42
26 U.S.C. § 1396p(c), as amended from time to time, on a person whose assets have been transferred
27 for less than fair market value.
28 (7) “Uncompensated care” — Care and services provided by a nursing facility to a
29 Medicaid applicant without receiving compensation therefore from Medicaid, Medicare, the
30 Medicaid applicant, or other source. The acceptance of any payment representing actual or
31 estimated applied income shall not disqualify the care and services provided from qualifying as
32 uncompensated care.
33 (b) Penalty period resulting from transfer. Any transfer or assignment of assets resulting in
34 the establishment or imposition of a penalty period shall create a debt that shall be due and owing
LC001571 - Page 36 of 93
1 to a nursing facility for the unpaid costs of care provided during the penalty period to a patient of
2 that facility who has been subject to the penalty period. The amount of the debt established shall
3 not exceed the fair market value of the transferred assets at the time of transfer that are the subject
4 of the penalty period. A nursing facility may bring an action to collect a debt for the unpaid costs
5 of care given to a patient who has been subject to a penalty period, against either the transferor or
6 the transferee, or both. The provisions of this section shall not affect other rights or remedies of the
7 parties.
8 (c) Applied income. A nursing facility may provide written notice to a patient who is a
9 Medicaid recipient and any authorized individual of that patient:
10 (1) Of the amount of applied income due;
11 (2) Of the recipient’s legal obligation to pay the applied income to the nursing facility; and
12 (3) That the recipient’s failure to pay applied income due to a nursing facility not later than
13 thirty (30) days after receiving notice from the nursing facility may result in a court action to
14 recover the amount of applied income due.
15 A nursing facility that is owed applied income may, in addition to any other remedies
16 authorized under law, bring a claim to recover the applied income against a patient and any
17 authorized individual. If a court of competent jurisdiction determines, based upon clear and
18 convincing evidence, that a defendant willfully failed to pay or withheld applied income due and
19 owing to a nursing facility for more than thirty (30) days after receiving notice pursuant to
20 subsection (c), the court may award the amount of the debt owed, court costs, and reasonable
21 attorney’s fees to the nursing facility.
22 (d) Effects. Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit or otherwise diminish any other
23 causes of action possessed by any such nursing facility. The death of the person receiving nursing
24 facility care shall not nullify or otherwise affect the liability of the person or persons charged with
25 the costs of care rendered or the applied income amount as referenced in this section.
26 SECTION 8. Sections 40-8-3.1, 40-8-9.1, 40-8-13.5, 40-8-15, 40-8-19.2 and 40-8-27 of

28 40-8-3.1. Life estate in property — Retained powers.
29 When an applicant or recipient of Medicaid owns a life estate in property that is his or her
30 principal place of residence with the reserved power and authority, during his or her lifetime, to
31 sell, convey, mortgage, or otherwise dispose of the real property without the consent or joinder by
32 the holder(s) of the remainder interest, the principal place of residence shall not be regarded as an
33 excluded resource for the purpose of Medicaid eligibility, unless the applicant or recipient
34 individually, or through his or her guardian, conservator, or attorney in fact, conveys all outstanding
LC001571 - Page 37 of 93
1 remainder interest to him or herself.
2 An applicant or recipient who, by a deed created, executed and recorded on or before June
3 30, 2014, has reserved a life estate in property that is his or her principal place of residence with
4 the reserved power and authority, during his or her lifetime, to sell, convey, mortgage, or otherwise
5 dispose of the real property without the consent or joinder by the holder(s) of the remainder interest,
6 shall not be ineligible for Medicaid on the basis of the deed, regardless of whether the transferee of
7 the remainder interest is a person or persons, trust, or entity.
8 40-8-9.1. Notice.
9 Whenever an individual who is receiving medical assistance under this chapter transfers
10 an interest in real or personal property, the individual shall notify the executive office of health and
11 human services within ten (10) days of the transfer. The notice shall be sent to the individual’s local
12 office and the legal office of the executive office of health and human services and include, at a
13 minimum, the individual’s name, social security number or, if different, the executive office of
14 health and human services identification number, the date of transfer, and the dollar value, if any,
15 paid or received by the individual who received benefits under this chapter. In the event an
16 individual fails to provide notice required by this section to the executive office of health and human
17 services and in the event an individual has received medical assistance, any individual and/or entity,
18 who knew or should have known that the individual failed to provide the notice and who receives
19 any distribution of value as a result of the transfer, shall be liable to the executive office of health
20 and human services to the extent of the value of the transfer. Moreover, any such individual shall
21 be subject to the provisions of § 40-6-15 and any remedy provided by applicable state and federal
22 laws and rules and regulations. Failure to comply with the notice requirements set forth in the
23 section shall not affect the marketability of title to real estate transferred while the transferor is
24 receiving medical assistance.
25 40-8-13.5. Hospital Incentive Program (HIP).
26 The secretary of the executive office of health and human services is authorized to seek the
27 federal authorities required to implement a hospital incentive program (HIP). The HIP shall provide
28 the participating licensed hospitals the ability to obtain certain payments for achieving performance
29 goals established by the secretary. HIP payments shall commence no earlier than July 1, 2016.
30 40-8-15. Lien on deceased recipient’s estate for assistance.
31 (a)(1) Upon the death of a recipient of Medicaid under Title XIX of the federal Social
32 Security Act (42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq. and referred to hereinafter as the “Act”), the total sum for
33 Medicaid benefits so paid on behalf of a beneficiary who was fifty-five (55) years of age or older
34 at the time of receipt shall be and constitute a lien upon the estate, as defined in subsection (a)(2),
LC001571 - Page 38 of 93
1 of the beneficiary in favor of the executive office of health and human services (“executive office”).
2 The lien shall not be effective and shall not attach as against the estate of a beneficiary who is
3 survived by a spouse, or a child who is under the age of twenty-one (21), or a child who is blind or
4 permanently and totally disabled as defined in Title XVI of the federal Social Security Act, 42
5 U.S.C. § 1381 et seq. The lien shall attach against property of a beneficiary, which is included or
6 includable in the decedent’s probate estate, regardless of whether or not a probate proceeding has
7 been commenced in the probate court by the executive office or by any other party. Provided,
8 however, that such lien shall only attach and shall only be effective against the beneficiary’s real
9 property included or includable in the beneficiary’s probate estate if such lien is recorded in the
10 land evidence records and is in accordance with subsection (e). Decedents who have received
11 Medicaid benefits are subject to the assignment and subrogation provisions of §§ 40-6-9 and 40-6-
12 10.
13 (2) For purposes of this section, the term “estate” with respect to a deceased individual
14 shall include all real and personal property and other assets included or includable within the
15 individual’s probate estate.
16 (b) The executive office is authorized to promulgate regulations to implement the terms,
17 intent, and purpose of this section and to require the legal representative(s) and/or the heirs-at-law
18 of the decedent to provide reasonable written notice to the executive office of the death of a
19 beneficiary of Medicaid benefits who was fifty-five (55) years of age or older at the date of death,
20 and to provide a statement identifying the decedent’s property and the names and addresses of all
21 persons entitled to take any share or interest of the estate as legatees or distributees thereof.
22 (c) The amount of reimbursement for Medicaid benefits imposed under this section shall
23 also become a debt to the state from the person or entity liable for the payment thereof.
24 (d) Upon payment of the amount of reimbursement for Medicaid benefits imposed by this
25 section, the secretary of the executive office, or his or her designee, shall issue a written discharge
26 of lien.
27 (e) Provided, however, that no lien created under this section shall attach nor become
28 effective upon any real property unless and until a statement of claim is recorded naming the
29 debtor/owner of record of the property as of the date and time of recording of the statement of
30 claim, and describing the real property by a description containing all of the following: (1) Tax
31 assessor’s plat and lot; and (2) Street address. The statement of claim shall be recorded in the
32 records of land evidence in the town or city where the real property is situated. Notice of the lien
33 shall be sent to the duly appointed executor or administrator, the decedent’s legal representative, if
34 known, or to the decedent’s next of kin or heirs at law as stated in the decedent’s last application
LC001571 - Page 39 of 93
1 for Medicaid benefits.
2 (f) The executive office shall establish procedures, in accordance with the standards
3 specified by the Secretary, United States Department of Health and Human Services, under which
4 the executive office shall waive, in whole or in part, the lien and reimbursement established by this
5 section if the lien and reimbursement would cause an undue hardship, as determined by the
6 executive office, on the basis of the criteria established by the secretary in accordance with 42
7 U.S.C. § 1396p(b)(3).
8 (g) Upon the filing of a petition for admission to probate of a decedent’s will or for
9 administration of a decedent’s estate, when the decedent was fifty-five (55) years or older at the
10 time of death, a copy of the petition and a copy of the death certificate shall be sent to the executive
11 office. Within thirty (30) days of a request by the executive office, an executor or administrator
12 shall complete and send to the executive office a form prescribed by that office and shall provide
13 such additional information as the office may require. In the event a petitioner fails to send a copy
14 of the petition and a copy of the death certificate to the executive office and a decedent has received
15 Medicaid benefits for which the executive office is authorized to recover, no distribution and/or
16 payments, including administration fees, shall be disbursed. Any person and/or entity that receives
17 a distribution of assets from the decedent’s estate shall be liable to the executive office to the extent
18 of such distribution.
19 (h) Compliance with the provisions of this section shall be consistent with the requirements
20 set forth in § 33-11-5 and the requirements of the affidavit of notice set forth in § 33-11-5.2. Nothing
21 in these sections shall limit the executive office from recovery, to the extent of the distribution, in
22 accordance with all state and federal laws.
23 (i) To ensure the financial integrity of the Medicaid eligibility determination, benefit
24 renewal, and estate recovery processes in this and related sections, the secretary of health and
25 human services is authorized and directed to, by no later than August 1, 2018: (1) Implement an
26 automated asset verification system, as mandated by § 1940 of the Act, that uses electronic data
27 sources to verify the ownership and value of countable resources held in financial institutions and
28 any real property for applicants and beneficiaries subject to resource and asset tests pursuant to the
29 Act in § 1902(e)(14)(D); (2) Apply the provisions required under §§ 1902(a)(18) and 1917(c) of
30 the Act pertaining to the disposition of assets for less than fair market value by applicants and
31 beneficiaries for Medicaid long-term services and supports and their spouses, without regard to
32 whether they are subject to or exempted from resources and asset tests as mandated by federal
33 guidance; and (3) Pursue any state plan or waiver amendments from the United States Centers for
34 Medicare and Medicaid Services and promulgate such rules, regulations, and procedures he or she
LC001571 - Page 40 of 93
1 deems necessary to carry out the requirements set forth herein and ensure the state plan and
2 Medicaid policy conform and comply with applicable provisions of Title XIX.
3 40-8-19.2. Nursing Facility Incentive Program (NFIP).
4 The secretary of the executive office of health and human services is authorized to seek the
5 federal authority required to implement a nursing facility incentive program (NFIP). The NFIP
6 shall provide the participating licensed nursing facilities the ability to obtain certain payments for
7 achieving performance goals established by the secretary. NFIP payments shall commence no
8 earlier than July 1, 2016.
9 40-8-27. Cooperation by providers.
10 Medicaid providers who employ individuals applying for benefits under any chapter of this
11 title shall comply in a timely manner with requests made by the department for any documents
12 describing employer-sponsored health insurance coverage or benefits the provider offers that are
13 necessary to determine eligibility for the state’s premium assistance program pursuant to § 40-8.4-
14 12. Documents requested by the department may include, but are not limited to, certificates of
15 coverage or a summary of benefits and employee obligations. Upon receiving notification that the
16 department has determined that the employee is eligible for premium assistance under § 40-8.4-12,
17 the provider shall accept the enrollment of the employee and his or her family in the employer-
18 based health insurance plan without regard to any seasonal enrollment restrictions, including open-
19 enrollment restrictions, and/or the impact on the employee’s wages. Additionally, the Medicaid
20 provider employing such persons shall not offer “pay in lieu of benefits.” Providers who do not
21 comply with the provisions set forth in this section shall be subject to suspension as a participating
22 Medicaid provider.
23 SECTION 9. Sections 40-8.4-4, 40-8.4-5, 40-8.4-10, 40-8.4-12, 40-8.4-15 and 40-8.4-19
24 of the General Laws in Chapter 40-8.4 entitled "Health Care for Families" are hereby amended to
25 read as follows:
26 40-8.4-4. Eligibility.
27 (a) Medical assistance for families. There is hereby established a category of medical
28 assistance eligibility pursuant to § 1931 of Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396u-
29 1, for families whose income and resources are no greater than the standards in effect in the aid to
30 families with dependent children program on July 16, 1996, or such increased standards as the
31 department may determine. The executive office of health and human services is directed to amend
32 the medical assistance Title XIX state plan and to submit to the United States Department of Health
33 and Human Services an amendment to the RIte Care waiver project to provide for medical
34 assistance coverage to families under this chapter in the same amount, scope, and duration as
LC001571 - Page 41 of 93
1 coverage provided to comparable groups under the waiver. The department is further authorized
2 and directed to submit amendments and/or requests for waivers to the Title XXI state plan as may
3 be necessary to maximize federal contribution for provision of medical assistance coverage
4 provided pursuant to this chapter, including providing medical coverage as a “qualified state” in
5 accordance with Title XXI of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1397aa et seq. Implementation
6 of expanded coverage under this chapter shall not be delayed pending federal review of any Title
7 XXI amendment or waiver.
8 (b) Income. The secretary of the executive office of health and human services is authorized
9 and directed to amend the medical assistance Title XIX state plan or RIte Care waiver to provide
10 medical assistance coverage through expanded income disregards or other methodology for parents
11 or relative caretakers whose income levels are below one hundred thirty-three percent (133%) of
12 the federal poverty level.
13 (c) Healthcare coverage provided under this section shall also be provided without regard
14 to availability of federal financial participation to a noncitizen family member who is a resident of
15 Rhode Island, and who is otherwise eligible for such assistance. The department is further
16 authorized to promulgate any regulations necessary, and in accord with title XIX [42 U.S.C. § 1396
17 et seq.] and title XXI [42 U.S.C. § 1397 et seq.] of the Social Security Act as necessary in order to
18 implement the state plan amendment. The executive office of health and human services is directed
19 to ensure that federal financial participation is assessed to the maximum extent allowable to provide
20 coverage pursuant to this section, at least every two (2) years, and that state-only funds will be used
21 only if federal financial participation is not available.
22 40-8.4-5. Managed care.
23 The delivery and financing of the healthcare services provided under this chapter shall may
24 be provided through a system of managed care. A managed care system integrates an efficient
25 financing mechanism with quality service delivery; provides a “medical home” to ensure
26 appropriate care and deter unnecessary and inappropriate care; and places emphasis on preventive
27 and primary health care. Beginning July 1, 2029, all payments shall be provided directly by the
28 state without an intermediate payment to a managed care entity or other form of health insurance
29 company, unless it is owned by the state. Beginning July 1, 2025, no new contracts may be entered
30 into between the Medicaid office and an intermediate payor such as a managed care entity or other
31 form of health insurance company for the payment of healthcare services pursuant to this chapter,
32 unless it is owned by the state.
33 40-8.4-10. Regulations.
34 (a) The department of human services Medicaid director is authorized to promulgate any
LC001571 - Page 42 of 93
1 regulations necessary to implement this chapter.
2 (b) When promulgating any rule or regulation necessary to implement this chapter, or any
3 rule or regulation related to RIte Care, the department Medicaid director shall send the notice
4 referred to in § 42-35-3 and a true copy of the rule referred to in § 42-35-4 of the Rhode Island
5 administrative procedures act to each of the co-chairpersons of the permanent joint committee on
6 health care oversight established by § 40-8.4-14.
7 40-8.4-12. RIte Share health insurance premium assistance program.
8 (a) Basic RIte Share health insurance premium assistance program. Under the terms
9 of Section 1906 of Title XIX of the U.S. Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396e, states are permitted
10 to pay a Medicaid-eligible person’s share of the costs for enrolling in employer-sponsored health
11 insurance (ESI) coverage if it is cost-effective to do so. Pursuant to the general assembly’s direction
12 in the Rhode Island health reform act of 2000, the Medicaid agency requested and obtained federal
13 approval under § 1916, 42 U.S.C. § 1396o, to establish the RIte Share premium assistance program
14 to subsidize the costs of enrolling Medicaid-eligible persons and families in employer-sponsored
15 health insurance plans that have been approved as meeting certain cost and coverage requirements.
16 The Medicaid agency also obtained, at the general assembly’s direction, federal authority to require
17 any such persons with access to ESI coverage to enroll as a condition of retaining eligibility
18 providing that doing so meets the criteria established in Title XIX for obtaining federal matching
19 funds.
20 (b) Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
21 (1) “Cost-effective” means that the portion of the ESI that the state would subsidize, as
22 well as wrap-around costs, would on average cost less to the state than enrolling that same
23 person/family in a managed-care delivery system.
24 (2) “Cost sharing” means any co-payments, deductibles, or co-insurance associated with
25 ESI.
26 (3) “Employee premium” means the monthly premium share a person or family is required
27 to pay to the employer to obtain and maintain ESI coverage.
28 (4) “Employer-sponsored insurance” or “ESI” means health insurance or a group health
29 plan offered to employees by an employer. This includes plans purchased by small employers
30 through the state health insurance marketplace, healthsource, RI (HSRI).
31 (5) “Policy holder” means the person in the household with access to ESI, typically the
32 employee.
33 (6) “RIte Share-approved employer-sponsored insurance (ESI)” means an employer-
34 sponsored health insurance plan that meets the coverage and cost-effectiveness criteria for RIte
LC001571 - Page 43 of 93
1 Share.
2 (7) “RIte Share buy-in” means the monthly amount an Medicaid-ineligible policy holder
3 must pay toward RIte Share-approved ESI that covers the Medicaid-eligible children, young adults,
4 or spouses with access to the ESI. The buy-in only applies in instances when household income is
5 above one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the FPL.
6 (8) “RIte Share premium assistance program” means the Rhode Island Medicaid premium
7 assistance program in which the State pays the eligible Medicaid member’s share of the cost of
8 enrolling in a RIte Share-approved ESI plan. This allows the state to share the cost of the health
9 insurance coverage with the employer.
10 (9) “RIte Share unit” means the entity within the executive office of health and human
11 services (EOHHS) responsible for assessing the cost-effectiveness of ESI, contacting employers
12 about ESI as appropriate, initiating the RIte Share enrollment and disenrollment process, handling
13 member communications, and managing the overall operations of the RIte Share program.
14 (10) “Third-party liability (TPL)” means other health insurance coverage. This insurance
15 is in addition to Medicaid and is usually provided through an employer. Since Medicaid is always
16 the payer of last resort, the TPL is always the primary coverage.
17 (11) “Wrap-around services or coverage” means any healthcare services not included in
18 the ESI plan that would have been covered had the Medicaid member been enrolled in a RIte Care
19 or Rhody Health Partners plan. Coverage of deductibles and co-insurance is included in the wrap.
20 Co-payments to providers are not covered as part of the wrap-around coverage.
21 (c) RIte Share populations. Medicaid beneficiaries subject to eligible for RIte Share
22 include: children, families, parent and caretakers eligible for Medicaid or the children’s health
23 insurance program (CHIP) under this chapter or chapter 12.3 of title 42; and adults between the
24 ages of nineteen (19) and sixty-four (64) who are eligible under chapter 8.12 of this title, not
25 receiving or eligible to receive Medicare, and are enrolled in managed care delivery systems. The
26 following conditions apply:
27 (1) The income of Medicaid beneficiaries shall affect whether and in what manner they
28 must may participate in RIte Share as follows:
29 (i) Income at or below one hundred fifty percent (150%) of FPL — Persons and families
30 determined to have household income at or below one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the federal
31 poverty level (FPL) guidelines based on the modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) standard or
32 other standard approved by the secretary are required to participate in RIte Share if a Medicaid-
33 eligible adult or parent/caretaker has access to cost-effective ESI. Enrolling in ESI through RIte
34 Share shall be a condition of maintaining Medicaid health coverage for any eligible adult with
LC001571 - Page 44 of 93
1 access to such coverage.
2 (ii) Income above one hundred fifty percent (150%) of FPL and policy holder is not
3 Medicaid-eligible — Premium assistance is available when the household includes Medicaid-
4 eligible members, but the ESI policy holder (typically a parent/caretaker, or spouse) is not eligible
5 for Medicaid. Premium assistance for parents/caretakers and other household members who are not
6 Medicaid-eligible may be provided in circumstances when enrollment of the Medicaid-eligible
7 family members in the approved ESI plan is contingent upon enrollment of the ineligible policy
8 holder and the executive office of health and human services (executive office) determines, based
9 on a methodology adopted for such purposes, that it is cost-effective to provide premium assistance
10 for family or spousal coverage.
11 (d) RIte Share enrollment as not a condition of eligibility. RIte Share enrollment shall
12 be purely voluntary and shall never be a condition of eligibility for Medicaid. For Medicaid
13 beneficiaries over the age of nineteen (19), enrollment in RIte Share shall be a condition of
14 eligibility except as exempted below and by regulations promulgated by the executive office.
15 (1) Medicaid-eligible children and young adults up to age nineteen (19) shall not be
16 required to enroll in a parent/caretaker relative’s ESI as a condition of maintaining Medicaid
17 eligibility if the person with access to RIte Share-approved ESI does not enroll as required. These
18 Medicaid-eligible children and young adults shall remain eligible for Medicaid and shall be
19 enrolled in a RIte Care plan.
20 (2) There shall be a limited six-month (6) exemption from the mandatory enrollment
21 requirement for persons participating in the RI works program pursuant to chapter 5.2 of this title.
22 (e) Approval of health insurance plans for premium assistance. The executive office of
23 health and human services shall adopt regulations providing for the approval of employer-based
24 health insurance plans for premium assistance and shall approve employer-based health insurance
25 plans based on these regulations. In order for an employer-based health insurance plan to gain
26 approval, the executive office must determine that the benefits offered by the employer-based
27 health insurance plan are substantially similar in amount, scope, and duration to the benefits
28 provided to Medicaid-eligible persons enrolled in a Medicaid managed care plan, when the plan is
29 evaluated in conjunction with available supplemental benefits provided by the office. The office
30 shall obtain and make available to persons otherwise eligible for Medicaid identified in this section
31 as supplemental benefits those benefits not reasonably available under employer-based health
32 insurance plans that are required for Medicaid beneficiaries by state law or federal law or
33 regulation. Once it has been determined by the Medicaid agency that the ESI offered by a particular
34 employer is RIte Share-approved, all Medicaid members with access to that employer’s plan are
LC001571 - Page 45 of 93
1 required to participate in RIte Share. Failure to meet the mandatory enrollment requirement shall
2 result in the termination of the Medicaid eligibility of the policy holder and other Medicaid
3 members nineteen (19) or older in the household who could be covered under the ESI until the
4 policy holder complies with the RIte Share enrollment procedures established by the executive
5 office.
6 (f) Premium assistance. The executive office shall provide premium assistance by paying
7 all or a portion of the employee’s cost for covering the eligible person and/or his or her family
8 under such a RIte Share-approved ESI plan subject to the buy-in provisions in this section.
9 (g) Buy-in. Persons who can afford it shall share in the cost. — The executive office is
10 authorized and directed to apply for and obtain any necessary state plan and/or waiver amendments
11 from the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to
12 require that persons enrolled in a RIte Share-approved employer-based health plan who have
13 income equal to or greater than one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the FPL to buy-in to pay a
14 share of the costs based on the ability to pay, provided that the buy-in cost shall not exceed five
15 percent (5%) of the person’s annual income. The executive office shall implement the buy-in by
16 regulation, and shall consider co-payments, premium shares, or other reasonable means to do so.
17 (h) Maximization of federal contribution. The executive office of health and human
18 services is authorized and directed to apply for and obtain federal approvals and waivers necessary
19 to maximize the federal contribution for provision of medical assistance coverage under this
20 section, including the authorization to amend the Title XXI state plan and to obtain any waivers
21 necessary to reduce barriers to provide premium assistance to recipients as provided for in Title
22 XXI of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1397aa et seq.
23 (i) Implementation by regulation. The executive office of health and human services is
24 authorized and directed to adopt regulations to ensure the establishment and implementation of the
25 premium assistance program in accordance with the intent and purpose of this section, the
26 requirements of Title XIX, Title XXI, and any approved federal waivers.
27 (j) Outreach and reporting. The executive office of health and human services shall
28 develop a plan to identify Medicaid-eligible individuals who have access to employer-sponsored
29 insurance and increase the use of RIte Share benefits. Beginning October 1, 2019, the executive
30 office shall submit the plan to be included as part of the reporting requirements under § 35-17-1.
31 Starting January 1, 2020, the executive office of health and human services shall include the number
32 of Medicaid recipients with access to employer-sponsored insurance, the number of plans that did
33 not meet the cost-effectiveness criteria for RIte Share, and enrollment in the premium assistance
34 program as part of the reporting requirements under § 35-17-1.
LC001571 - Page 46 of 93
1 (k) Employer-sponsored insurance. The executive office of health and human services
2 shall dedicate staff and resources to reporting monthly as part of the requirements under § 35-17-1
3 which employer-sponsored insurance plans meet the cost-effectiveness criteria for RIte Share.
4 Information in the report shall be used for screening for Medicaid enrollment to encourage Rite
5 Share participation. By October 1, 2021, the report shall include any employers with 300 or more
6 employees. By January 1, 2022, the report shall include employers with 100 or more employees.
7 The January report shall also be provided to the chairperson of the house finance committee; the
8 chairperson of the senate finance committee; the house fiscal advisor; the senate fiscal advisor; and
9 the state budget officer.

26 program, the executive office is authorized to seek any and all data-sharing agreements or other
27 agreements with the Social Security Administration as may be necessary to receive timely and
28 accurate diagnostic data and clinical assessments. This information shall be used exclusively for
29 the purpose of service planning, and shall be held and exchanged in accordance with all applicable
30 state and federal medical record confidentiality laws and regulations.

9 pursuant to this chapter.
10 (b) Income. The secretary of the executive office of health and human services is authorized
11 and directed to amend the Medicaid Title XIX state plan and, as deemed necessary, any waiver
12 authority to effectuate this expansion of coverage to any Rhode Islander who qualifies for Medicaid

14 of the federal poverty level, based on modified adjusted-gross income.
15 (c) Delivery system. The executive office of health and human services is authorized and
16 directed to apply for and obtain any waiver authorities necessary to provide persons eligible under
17 this chapter with managed, coordinated healthcare coverage consistent with the principles set forth
18 in chapter 12.4 of title 42, pertaining to a healthcare home. Beginning July 1, 2029, all payments

28 pay one-half of the cost of a commercial plan that a parent may incur after subtracting the cost-
29 sharing requirement under § 40-8.4-4 as of December 31, 2013, and any applicable federal tax
30 credits available. The office is also directed to amend the 1115 waiver demonstration extension and

3 transition expenses to reduce the impact on an individual who has been transitioned from a state
4 program to a health insurance plan available through the health benefits exchange. It shall not be
5 deemed cost-effective for the state if it would result in a loss of benefits or an increase in the cost
6 of healthcare services for the person above an amount deemed de minimus as determined by state
7 regulation.

3 and concerns are promptly addressed.
4 40-8.13-5. Financial principles under managed care.
5 (a) To the extent that financial savings are a goal under any managed long-term-care
6 arrangement, it is the intent of the legislature to achieve savings through administrative efficiencies,
7 care coordination, improvements in care outcomes and in a way that encourages the highest quality
8 care for patients and maximizes value for the managed-care organization and the state. Therefore,
9 any managed long-term-care arrangement shall include a requirement that the managed care
10 organization reimburse providers for services in accordance with these principles. Notwithstanding
11 any law to the contrary, for the twelve-month (12) period beginning July 1, 2015, Medicaid
12 managed long-term-care payment rates to nursing facilities established pursuant to this section shall
13 not exceed ninety-eight percent (98.0%) of the rates in effect on April 1, 2015.
14 (1) For a duals demonstration project, the managed care organization:
15 (i) Shall not combine the rates of payment for post-acute skilled and rehabilitation care
16 provided by a nursing facility and long-term and chronic care provided by a nursing facility in order
17 to establish a single-payment rate for dual eligible beneficiaries requiring skilled nursing services;
18 (ii) Shall pay nursing facilities providing post-acute skilled and rehabilitation care or long-
19 term and chronic care rates that reflect the different level of services and intensity required to
20 provide these services; and
21 (iii) For purposes of determining the appropriate rate for the type of care identified in
22 subsection (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the managed care organization shall pay no less than the rates
23 that would be paid for that care under traditional Medicare and Rhode Island Medicaid for these
24 service types. The managed care organization shall not, however, be required to use the same
25 payment methodology.
26 The state shall not enter into any agreement with a managed care organization in connection
27 with a duals demonstration project unless that agreement conforms to this section, and any existing
28 such agreement shall be amended as necessary to conform to this subsection.
29 (2) For a managed long-term-care arrangement that is not a duals demonstration project,
30 the managed care organization shall reimburse providers in an amount not less than the amount that
31 would be paid for the same care by the executive office of health and human services under the
32 Medicaid program. The managed care organization shall not, however, be required to use the same
33 payment methodology as the executive office of health and human services.
34 (3) Notwithstanding any provisions of the general or public laws to the contrary, the
LC001571 - Page 54 of 93
1 protections of subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section may be waived by a nursing facility in
2 the event it elects to accept a payment model developed jointly by the managed care organization
3 and skilled nursing facilities, that is intended to promote quality of care and cost-effectiveness,
4 including, but not limited to, bundled-payment initiatives, value-based purchasing arrangements,
5 gainsharing, and similar models.
6 (b) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, for the twelve-month (12) period beginning
7 July 1, 2015, Medicaid managed long-term-care payment rates to nursing facilities established
8 pursuant to this section shall not exceed ninety-eight percent (98.0%) of the rates in effect on April
9 1, 2015.
10 40-8.13-6. Payment incentives.
11 In order to encourage quality improvement and promote appropriate utilization incentives
12 for providers in a managed long-term-care arrangement, a managed care organization may use
13 incentive or bonus payment programs that are in addition to the rates identified in § 40-8.13-5.
14 40-8.13-7. Willing provider.
15 A managed care organization must contract with and cover services furnished by any
16 nursing facility licensed under chapter 17 of title 23 and certified by CMS that provides Medicaid-
17 covered nursing facility services pursuant to a provider agreement with the state, provided that the
18 nursing facility is not disqualified under the managed care organization’s quality standards that are
19 applicable to all nursing facilities; and the nursing facility is willing to accept the reimbursement
20 rates described in § 40-8.13-5.
21 40-8.13-8. Level-of-care tool.
22 A managed long-term-care arrangement must require that all participating managed care
23 organizations use only the EOHHS level-of-care tool in determining coverage of long-term-care
24 supports and services for beneficiaries. EOHHS may amend the level-of-care tool provided that
25 any changes are established in consultation with beneficiaries and providers of Medicaid-covered
26 long-term-care supports and services, and are based upon reasonable medical evidence or
27 consensus, in consideration of the specific needs of Rhode Island beneficiaries. Notwithstanding
28 any other provisions herein, however, in the case of a duals demonstration project, a managed care
29 organization may use a different level-of-care tool for determining coverage of services that would
30 otherwise be covered by Medicare, since the criteria established by EOHHS are directed towards
31 Medicaid-covered services; provided, that the level-of-care tool is based on reasonable medical
32 evidence or consensus in consideration of the specific needs of Rhode Island beneficiaries.
33 40-8.13-9. Case management/plan of care.
34 No managed care organization acting under a managed long-term-care arrangement may
LC001571 - Page 55 of 93
1 require a provider to change a plan of care if the provider reasonably believes that such an action
2 would conflict with the provider’s responsibility to develop an appropriate care plan under state
3 and federal regulations.
4 40-8.13-10. Care transitions.
5 In the event that a beneficiary:
6 (1) Has been determined to meet level-of-care requirements for nursing facility coverage
7 as of the date of his or her enrollment in a managed care organization; or
8 (2) Has been determined to meet level of care requirements for nursing facility coverage
9 by a managed care organization after enrollment; and there is a change in condition whereby the
10 managed care organization determines that the beneficiary no longer meets such level-of-care
11 requirements, the nursing facility shall promptly arrange for an appropriate and safe discharge (with
12 the assistance of the managed care organization if the facility requests it), and the managed care
13 organization shall continue to pay for the beneficiary’s nursing facility care at the same rate until
14 the beneficiary is discharged.
15 40-8.13-11. Reporting requirements.
16 EOHHS shall report to the general assembly and shall make available to interested persons
17 a separate accounting of state expenditures for long-term-care supports and services under any
18 managed long-term-care arrangement, specifically and separately identifying expenditures for
19 home- and community-based services, assisted-living services, hospice services within nursing
20 facilities, hospice services outside of nursing facilities, and nursing facility services. Such reports
21 shall be made twice annually, six (6) months apart, beginning six (6) months following the
22 implementation of any managed long-term-care arrangement, and shall include a detailed report of
23 utilization of each service. In order to facilitate reporting, any managed long-term-care arrangement
24 shall include a requirement that a participating managed care organization make timely reports of
25 the data necessary to compile the reports.
26 SECTION 14. Sections 42-7.2-10, 42-7.2-16 and 42-7.2-16.1 of the General Laws in
27 Chapter 42-7.2 entitled "Office of Health and Human Services" are hereby amended to read as
28 follows:
29 42-7.2-10. Appropriations and disbursements.
30 (a) The general assembly shall annually appropriate such sums as it may deem necessary
31 for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this chapter. The state controller is hereby
32 authorized and directed to draw his or her orders upon the general treasurer for the payment of such
33 sum or sums, or so much thereof as may from time to time be required, upon receipt by him or her
34 of proper vouchers approved by the secretary of the executive office of health and human services,
LC001571 - Page 56 of 93
1 or his or her designee.
2 (b) The general assembly shall, through the utilization of federal Medicaid reimbursement
3 for administrative costs, and additional funds, appropriate such funds as may be necessary to hire
4 additional personnel for the Medicaid office as follows: one hundred (100) outreach social workers
5 to encourage, assist and expedite individuals applying for Medicaid benefits; one hundred (100)
6 new programmers in order to build digital infrastructure for the Medicaid office; thirty (30) new
7 social workers and ten (10) new programmers to help increase spend down program utilization and
8 feasibility and examine possible legal changes necessary to increase spend down program
9 eligibility; and fifty (50) additional personnel for building administrative capacity. The Medicaid
10 office shall be exempt from any limitations placed on the number of full-time equivalent personnel
11 employed by the executive office of health and human services.
12 (b)(c) For the purpose of recording federal financial participation associated with
13 qualifying healthcare workforce development activities at the state’s public institutions of higher
14 education, and pursuant to the Rhode Island designated state health programs (DSHP), as approved
15 by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMC) October 20, 2016, in the 11-W-00242/1
16 amendment to Rhode Island’s section 1115 Demonstration Waiver, there is hereby established a
17 restricted-receipt account entitled “Health System Transformation Project” in the general fund of
18 the state and included in the budget of the office of health and human services. Due to the COVID-
19 19 pandemic, the office of health and human services is forbidden from utilizing any funds within
20 the health system transformation project restricted receipts account for any imposition of downside
21 risk for providers. No payment models that impose downside risk or in any way deviate from fee-
22 for-service shall be utilized for the Medicaid program without explicit authorization by the general
23 assembly.
24 (c)(d) There are hereby created within the general fund of the state and housed within the
25 budget of the office of health and human services two restricted receipt accounts, respectively
26 entitled “HCBS Support-ARPA” and “HCBS Admin Support-ARPA”. Amounts deposited into
27 these accounts are equivalent to the general revenue savings generated by the enhanced federal
28 match received on eligible home and community-based services between April 1, 2021, and March
29 31, 2022, allowable under Section 9817 of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, Pub. L. No.
30 117-2. Funds deposited into the “HCBS Support-ARPA” account will be used to finance the state
31 share of newly eligible Medicaid expenditures by the office of health and human services and its
32 sister agencies, including the department of children, youth and families, the department of health,
33 and the department of behavioral healthcare, developmental disabilities and hospitals. Funds
34 deposited into the “HCBS Admin Support-ARPA” account will be used to finance the state share
LC001571 - Page 57 of 93
1 of allowable administrative expenditures attendant to the implementation of these newly eligible
2 Medicaid expenditures. The accounts created under this subsection shall be exempt from the
3 indirect cost recovery provisions of § 35-4-27.
4 (d)(e) There is hereby created within the general fund of the state and housed within the
5 budget of the office of health and human services a restricted receipt account entitled “Rhode Island
6 Statewide Opioid Abatement Account” for the purpose of receiving and expending monies from
7 settlement agreements with opioid manufacturers, pharmaceutical distributors, pharmacies, or their
8 affiliates, as well as monies resulting from bankruptcy proceedings of the same entities. The
9 executive office of health and human services shall deposit any revenues from such sources that
10 are designated for opioid abatement purposes into the restricted receipt account. Funds from this
11 account shall only be used for forward-looking opioid abatement efforts as defined and limited by
12 any settlement agreements, state-city and town agreements, or court orders pertaining to the use of
13 such funds. By January 1 of each calendar year, the secretary of health and human services shall
14 report to the governor, the speaker of the house of representatives, the president of the senate, and
15 the attorney general on the expenditures that were funded using monies from the Rhode Island
16 statewide opioid abatement account and the amount of funds spent. The account created under this
17 subsection shall be exempt from the indirect cost recovery provisions of § 35-4-27. No
18 governmental entity has the authority to assert a claim against the entities with which the attorney
19 general has entered into settlement agreements concerning the manufacturing, marketing,
20 distributing, or selling of opioids that are the subject of the Rhode Island Memorandum of
21 Understanding Between the State and Cities and Towns Receiving Opioid Settlement Funds
22 executed by every city and town and the attorney general and wherein every city and town agreed
23 to release all such claims against these settling entities, and any amendment thereto. Governmental
24 entity means any state or local governmental entity or sub-entity and includes, but is not limited to,
25 school districts, fire districts, and any other such districts. The claims that shall not be asserted are
26 the released claims, as that term is defined in the settlement agreements executed by the attorney
27 general, or, if not defined therein, the claims sought to be released in such settlement agreements.
28 42-7.2-16. Medicaid System Reform 2008. Medicaid System Reform.
29 (a) The executive office of health and human services, in conjunction with the department
30 of human services, the department of children, youth and families, the department of health and the
31 department of behavioral healthcare, developmental disabilities and hospitals, is authorized to
32 design options that further the reforms in Medicaid initiated in 2008 Medicaid reform to ensure that
33 the program: transitions to a Medicare level of care as a first step in the transition to a state-level
34 Medicare for All system; phases out the use of intermediary privatized insurance companies such
LC001571 - Page 58 of 93
1 as managed care entities; transitions to the management of health insurers acquired due to
2 insolvency, smoothly integrating publicly owned health insurers with the Medicaid system; utilizes
3 payment models such as fee-for-service that incentivize higher quality of care and more utilization
4 of care; provides for the financial health of Rhode Island healthcare providers; encourages fair
5 wages and benefits for Rhode Island's healthcare workforce; develops and builds out the Medicaid
6 office's human capital, technological infrastructure, expertise, and general ability to manage
7 healthcare payments to prepare for the transition to a single-payer Medicare-for-All system; and
8 guides the transition of the Rhode Island healthcare funding system to a state-level Medicare-for-
9 All system. utilizes competitive and value based purchasing to maximize the available service
10 options, promotes accountability and transparency, and encourages and rewards healthy outcomes,
11 independence, and responsible choices; promotes efficiencies and the coordination of services
12 across all health and human services agencies; and ensures the state will have a fiscally sound
13 source of publicly-financed health care for Rhode Islanders in need.
14 (b) Principles and goals. In developing and implementing this system of reform, the
15 executive office of health and human services and the four (4) health and human services
16 departments shall pursue the following principles and goals:
17 (1) Empower consumers to make reasoned and cost-effective choices about their health by
18 providing them with the information and array of service options they need and offering rewards
19 for healthy decisions;
20 (2) Encourage personal responsibility by assuring the information available to beneficiaries
21 is easy to understand and accurate, provide that a fiscal intermediary is provided when necessary,
22 and adequate access to needed services;
23 (3) When appropriate, promote community-based care solutions by transitioning
24 beneficiaries from institutional settings back into the community and by providing the needed
25 assistance and supports to beneficiaries requiring long-term care or residential services who wish
26 to remain, or are better served in the community;
27 (4) Enable consumers to receive individualized health care that is outcome-oriented,
28 focused on prevention, disease management, recovery and maintaining independence;
29 (5) Promote competition between healthcare providers to ensure best value purchasing, to
30 leverage resources and to create opportunities for improving service quality and performance;
31 (6) Redesign purchasing and payment methods to assure fiscal accountability and
32 encourage and to reward service quality and cost-effectiveness by tying reimbursements to
33 evidence-based performance measures and standards, including those related to patient satisfaction
34 promote payment models such as fee-for-service that incentivize higher quality of care and phase
LC001571 - Page 59 of 93
1 out the use of payment models that shift risk to providers, such as capitation, episode-based
2 payments, global budgets, and similar models; and
3 (7) Continually improve technology to take advantage of recent innovations and advances
4 that help decision makers, consumers and providers to make informed and cost-effective decisions
5 regarding health care.
6 (c) The executive office of health and human services shall annually submit a report to the
7 governor and the general assembly describing the status of the administration and implementation
8 of the Medicaid Section 1115 demonstration waiver.
9 42-7.2-16.1. Reinventing Medicaid Act of 2015.
10 (a) Findings. The Rhode Island Medicaid program is an integral component of the state’s
11 healthcare system that provides crucial services and supports to many Rhode Islanders. As the
12 program’s reach has expanded, the costs of the program have continued to rise and the delivery of
13 care has become more fragmented and uncoordinated. Given the crucial role of the Medicaid
14 program to the state, it is of compelling importance that the state conduct a fundamental
15 restructuring of its Medicaid program that achieves measurable improvement in health outcomes
16 for the people and transforms the healthcare system to one that pays for the outcomes and quality
17 they deserve at a sustainable, predictable and affordable cost. The Reinventing Medicaid Act of
18 2015, as implemented in the budget for fiscal year two thousand sixteen (FY2016), involved drastic
19 cuts to the Medicaid program, along with policies that shifted risk to providers away from
20 intermediary insurers. Since the passage of that act, the finances of healthcare providers in Rhode
21 Island have deteriorated significantly, and it is therefore the duty of the general assembly to seek
22 corrective action to restore critical investments in the Medicaid system and redesign payment
23 models to remove risk from providers and concentrate risk in private insurance companies during
24 their phase-out period along the transition to Medicare-for-All.
25 (b) The Working Group to Reinvent Medicaid, which was established to refine the
26 principles and goals of the Medicaid reforms begun in 2008, was directed to present to the general
27 assembly and the governor initiatives to improve the value, quality, and outcomes of the health care
28 funded by the Medicaid program.
29 SECTION 15. Chapter 42-12.1 of the General Laws entitled "Department of Behavioral
30 Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities and Hospitals" is hereby amended by adding thereto the
31 following section:
32 42-12.1-11. The Rhode Island mental health nursing facility.
33 (a) There is hereby established a state nursing facility for the care for Rhode Islanders in
34 need of nursing facility-level inpatient behavioral healthcare known as the Rhode Island mental
LC001571 - Page 60 of 93
1 health nursing facility. The Rhode Island mental health nursing facility shall fall within the purview
2 of the department, and the chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and chief medical officer
3 shall be appointed by the governor with advice and consent of the senate.
4 SECTION 16. Sections 42-12.3-3, 42-12.3-5, 42-12.3-7 and 42-12.3-9 of the General Laws
5 in Chapter 42-12.3 entitled "Health Care for Children and Pregnant Women" are hereby amended
6 to read as follows:

17 1396 et seq.] and Title XXI [42 U.S.C. § 1397aa et seq.] of the Social Security Act.
18 (b) The secretary of health and human services is authorized and directed to establish a
19 payor of last resort program to cover prenatal, delivery and postpartum care. The program shall
20 cover the cost of maternity care for any person who lacks health insurance coverage for maternity
21 care and who is not eligible for medical assistance under Title XIX [42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq.] and
22 Title XXI [42 U.S.C. § 1397aa et seq.] of the Social Security Act including, but not limited to, a
23 noncitizen pregnant person lawfully admitted for permanent residence on or after August 22, 1996,

9 and social service counseling; high-risk obstetrical care; childbirth and parenting preparation
10 programs; smoking cessation programs; outpatient counseling for drug-alcohol use; interpreter
11 services; mental health services; and home visitation. The provision of enhanced services is subject
12 to available appropriations. In the event that appropriations are not adequate for the provision of
13 these services, the executive office has the authority to limit the amount, scope, and duration of
14 these enhanced services.
15 (f) The executive office of health and human services shall provide for extended family
16 planning services for up to twenty-four (24) months postpartum. These services shall be available
17 to persons who have been determined eligible for RIte Start or for medical assistance under Title
18 XIX [42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq.] or Title XXI [42 U.S.C. § 1397aa et seq.] of the Social Security

24 will be provided to eligible Rhode Island residents without regard to the availability of federal
25 financial participation. The executive office of health and human services is directed to ensure that
26 federal financial participation is used to the maximum extent allowable to provide coverage
27 pursuant to this section, and that state-only funds will be used only if federal financial participation
28 is not available.
29 (h) Any person eligible for services under subsections (a) and (b) of this section, or
30 otherwise eligible for medical assistance under Title XIX [42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq.] and Title XXI

32 termination of pregnancy permitted under § 23-4.13-2; provided, however, that no federal funds
33 shall be used to pay for such services, except as authorized under federal law.
34 42-12.3-5. Managed care.
LC001571 - Page 62 of 93
1 The delivery and financing of the health care services provided pursuant to §§ 42-12.3-3
2 and 42-12.3-4 shall may be provided through a system of managed care. The delivery and financing
3 of the healthcare services provided under this chapter may be provided through a system of
4 managed care. Beginning July 1, 2029, all payments shall be provided directly by the state without
5 an intermediate payment to a managed care entity or other form of health insurance company,
6 unless the intermediate payor is owned by the Medicaid office or another branch of state
7 government. Beginning July 1, 2025, no new contracts may be entered into between the Medicaid
8 office and an intermediate payor such as a managed care entity or other form of health insurance
9 company for the payment of healthcare services pursuant to this chapter, unless the intermediate
10 payor is owned by the Medicaid office or another branch of state government.
11 A managed care system integrates an efficient financing mechanism with quality service
12 delivery, provides a “medical home” to assure appropriate care and deter unnecessary and
13 inappropriate care, and places emphasis on preventive and primary health care. In developing a
14 managed care system the department of human services shall consider managed care models
15 recognized by the health care financing administration. The department of human services is hereby
16 authorized and directed to seek any necessary approvals or waivers from the U.S. Department of
17 Health and Human Services, Health Care Financing Administration, needed to assure that services
18 are provided through a mandatory managed care system. Certain health services may be provided
19 on an interim basis through a fee for service arrangement upon a finding that there are temporary
20 barriers to implementation of mandatory managed care for a particular population or particular
21 geographic area. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the department of human services from
22 providing enhanced services to medical assistance recipients within existing appropriations.
23 42-12.3-7. Financial contributions.
24 The department of human services may not require the payment of enrollment fees, sliding
25 fees, deductibles, co-payments, and/or other contributions based on ability to pay. These fees shall
26 be established by rules and regulations to be promulgated by the department of human services or
27 the department of health, as appropriate.
28 42-12.3-9. Insurance coverage — Third party insurance.
29 (a) No payment will be made nor service provided in the RIte Start or RIte Track program
30 with respect to any health care that is covered or would be covered, by any employee welfare benefit
31 plan under which a woman or child is either covered or eligible to be covered either as an employee
32 or dependent, whether or not coverage under such plan is elected.
33 (b) A premium may be charged for participation in the RIte Track or RIte Start programs
34 for eligible individuals whose family incomes are in excess of two hundred fifty percent (250%) of
LC001571 - Page 63 of 93
1 the federal poverty level and who have voluntarily terminated health care insurance within one year
2 of the date of application for benefits under this chapter.
3 (c)(b) Every family who is eligible to participate in the RIte Track program, who has an
4 additional child who because of age is not eligible for RIte Track, or whose child becomes ineligible
5 for RIte Track because of his or her age, may be offered by the managed care provider with whom
6 the family is enrolled, the opportunity to enroll such ineligible child or children in the same
7 managed care program on a self-pay basis at the same cost, charge or premium as is being charged
8 to the state under the provisions of this chapter for other covered children within the managed care
9 program. The family may also purchase a package of enhanced services at the same cost or charge
10 to the department.
11 SECTION 17. Section 42-12.3-14 of the General Laws in Chapter 42-12.3 entitled "Health
12 Care for Children and Pregnant Women" is hereby repealed.
13 42-12.3-14. Benefits and coverage — Exclusion.
14 For as long as the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Health Care
15 Financing Administration Project No. 11-W-0004/1-01 entitled “RIte Care” remains in effect, any
16 health care services provided pursuant to this chapter shall be exempt from all mandatory benefits
17 and coverage as may otherwise be provided for in the general laws.
18 SECTION 18. Sections 42-14.5-2 and 42-14.5-3 of the General Laws in Chapter 42-14.5
19 entitled "The Rhode Island Health Care Reform Act of 2004 — Health Insurance Oversight" are
20 hereby amended to read as follows:
21 42-14.5-2. Purpose.
22 With respect to health insurance as defined in § 42-14-5, the health insurance commissioner
23 shall discharge the powers and duties of office to:
24 (1) Guard the solvency of health insurers Claw back excessive profits, reserves charges,
25 and other monies that health insurers may have accumulated against the public interest of the people
26 of Rhode Island;
27 (2) Protect the interests of consumers;
28 (3) Encourage fair treatment of health care providers;
29 (4) Encourage policies and developments that improve the quality and efficiency of health

14 this chapter, and shall at the same time pay an annual tax to the tax administrator of two percent
15 (2%) three percent (3%) of the gross premiums on contracts of insurance and six percent (6%) of
16 all Medicaid payments received by an insurance company, except for ocean marine insurance as
17 referred to in § 44-17-6, covering property and risks within the state, written during the calendar
18 year ending December 31st next preceding.
19 (b) Qualifying insurers for purposes of this section means every domestic, foreign, or alien
20 insurance company, mutual association, organization, or other insurer and excludes:
21 (1) Health maintenance organizations, as defined in § 27-41-2;
22 (2) Nonprofit dental service corporations, as defined in § 27-20.1-2; and
23 (3) Nonprofit hospital or medical service corporations, as defined in §§ 27-19-1 and 27-
24 20-1.
25 (c) For tax years 2018 and thereafter, the rate of taxation may be reduced as set forth below
26 and, if so reduced, shall be fully applicable to qualifying insurers instead of the two percent (2%)
27 rate listed in subsection (a). In the case of foreign or alien companies, except as provided in § 27-
28 2-17(d), the tax shall not be less in amount than is imposed by the laws of the state or country under
29 which the companies are organized upon like companies incorporated in this state or upon its
30 agents, if doing business to the same extent in the state or country. The tax rate shall not be reduced
31 for gross premiums written on contracts of health insurance as defined in § 42-14-5(c) but shall
32 remain at two percent (2%) three percent (3%) or the appropriate retaliatory tax rate, whichever is
33 higher.
34 (d) For qualifying insurers, the premium tax rate may be decreased based upon Rhode
LC001571 - Page 76 of 93
1 Island jobs added by the industry as detailed below:
2 (1) A committee shall be established for the purpose of implementing tax rates using the
3 framework established herein. The committee shall be comprised of the following persons or their
4 designees: the secretary of commerce, the director of the department of business regulation, the
5 director of the department of revenue, and the director of the office of management and budget. No
6 rule may be issued pursuant to this section without the prior, unanimous approval of the committee;
7 (2) On the timetable listed below, the committee shall determine whether qualifying
8 insurers have added new qualifying jobs in this state in the preceding calendar year. A qualifying
9 job for purposes of this section is any employee with total annual wages equal to or greater than
10 forty percent (40%) of the average annual wages of the Rhode Island insurance industry, as
11 published by the annual employment and wages report of the Rhode Island department of labor and
12 training, in NAICS code 5241;
13 (3) If the committee determines that there has been a sufficient net increase in qualifying
14 jobs in the preceding calendar year(s) to offset a material reduction in the premium tax, it shall
15 calculate a reduced premium tax rate. Such rate shall be determined via a method selected by the
16 committee and designed such that the estimated personal income tax generated by the increase in
17 qualifying jobs is at least one hundred and twenty-five percent (125%) of the anticipated reduction
18 in premium tax receipts resulting from the new rate. For purposes of this calculation, the committee
19 may consider personal income tax withholdings or receipts, but in no event may the committee
20 include for the purposes of determining revenue neutrality income taxes that are subject to
21 segregation pursuant to § 44-48.3-8(f) or that are otherwise available to the general fund;
22 (4) Any reduced rate established pursuant to this section must be established in a
23 rulemaking proceeding pursuant to chapter 35 of title 42, subject to the following conditions:
24 (i) Any net increase in qualifying jobs and the resultant premium tax reduction and revenue
25 impact shall be determined in any rulemaking proceeding conducted under this section and shall
26 be set forth in a report included in the rulemaking record, which report shall also include a
27 description of the data sources and calculation methods used. The first such report shall also include
28 a calculation of the baseline level of employment of qualifying insurers for the calendar year 2015;
29 and
30 (ii) Notwithstanding any provision of the law to the contrary, no rule changing the tax rate
31 shall take effect until one hundred and twenty (120) days after notice of the rate change is provided
32 to the speaker of the house, the president of the senate, the house and senate fiscal advisors, and
33 the auditor general, which notice shall include the report required under the preceding provision.
34 (5) For each of the first three (3) rulemaking proceedings required under this section, the
LC001571 - Page 77 of 93
1 tax rate may remain unchanged or be decreased consistent with the requirements of this section,
2 but may not be increased. These first three (3) rulemaking proceedings shall be conducted by the
3 division of taxation and occur in the following manner:
4 (i) The first rulemaking proceeding shall take place in calendar year 2017. This proceeding
5 shall establish a rule that sets forth: (A) A new premium tax rate, if allowed under the requirements
6 of this section, which rate shall take effect in 2018, and (B) A method for calculating the number
7 of jobs at qualifying insurers;
8 (ii) The second rulemaking proceeding shall take place in calendar year 2018. This
9 proceeding shall establish a rule that sets forth: (A) A new premium tax rate, if allowed under the
10 requirements of this section, which rate shall take effect in 2019, and (B) The changes, if any, to
11 the method for calculating the number of jobs at qualifying insurers; and
12 (iii) The third rulemaking proceeding shall take place in calendar year 2019. This
13 proceeding shall establish a rule that sets forth: (A) A new premium tax rate, if allowed under the
14 requirements of this section, which rate shall take effect in 2020, and (B) The changes, if any, to
15 the method for calculating the number of jobs at qualifying insurers.
16 (6) The tax rate established in the regulation following regulatory proceedings that take
17 place in 2019 shall remain in effect through and including 2023. In calendar year 2023, the
18 department of business regulation will conduct a rulemaking proceeding and issue a rule that sets
19 forth: (A) A new premium tax rate, if allowed under the requirements of this section, which rate
20 shall take effect in 2024, and (B) The changes, if any, to the method for calculating the number of
21 jobs at qualifying insurers. A rule issued by the department of business regulation may decrease
22 the tax rate if the requirements for a rate reduction contained in this section are met, or it may
23 increase the tax rate to the extent necessary to achieve the overall revenue level sought when the
24 then-existing tax rate was established. Any rate established shall be no lower than one percent (1%)
25 and no higher than two percent (2%). This proceeding shall be repeated every three (3) calendar
26 years thereafter, however, the base for determination of job increases or decreases shall remain the
27 number of jobs existing during calendar year 2022;
28 (7) No reduction in the premium tax rate pursuant to this section shall be allowed absent a
29 determination that qualifying insurers have added in this state at least three hundred fifty (350)
30 new, full-time, qualifying jobs above the baseline level of employment of qualifying insurers for
31 the calendar year 2015;
32 (8) Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, the premium tax rate shall
33 never be set lower than one percent (1%);
34 (9) The division of taxation may adopt implementation guidelines, directives, criteria, rules
LC001571 - Page 78 of 93
1 and regulations pursuant to chapter 35 of title 42 as are necessary to implement this section; and
2 (10) The calculation of revenue impacts under this section is at the sole discretion of the
3 committee established under subsection (d)(1). Notwithstanding any provision of law to the
4 contrary, any administrative action or rule setting a tax rate pursuant to this section or failing or
5 declining to alter a tax rate pursuant to this section shall not be subject to judicial review under
6 chapter 35 of title 42.
7 (d) The department of revenue shall calculate the impacts of changes made to Medicaid
8 taking effect during or after fiscal year two thousand twenty-six (FY2026) on state funds, excluding
9 increased federal reimbursements, hereinafter the "Medicaid adjustment." Should the Medicaid
10 adjustment exceed the revenue impact of raising the gross premiums tax rate from two percent (2%)
11 to three percent (3%), hereinafter the "insurance premium tax rate adjustment revenue bonus," a
12 surtax shall be imposed on gross premiums written on contracts of health insurance as defined in §
13 42-14-5(c) at the rate that shall raise aggregate revenue equal to the Medicaid adjustment minus
14 the insurance premium tax rate adjustment revenue bonus.

32 established in subsection (b) of this section exceeds the maximum rate of assessment that federal

34 directed to reduce the assessment to a rate equal to the maximum rate which the federal law will
LC001571 - Page 79 of 93

7 (c) If, after applying the applicable federal law and/or rules, regulations, or standards
8 relating to healthcare providers, the tax administrator determines that the assessment rate

10 law will allow without reduction in federal financial participation, then the tax administrator is
11 directed to reduce the assessment to a rate equal to the maximum rate which the federal law will
12 allow without reduction in federal participation. Provided, however, that the authority of the tax
13 administrator to lower the assessment rate established in subsection (a) of this section shall be

27 If the general treasurer shall deposit with the paying agent for the capital development
28 bonds the proceeds of the refunding bonds, or proceeds from other sources, amounts that, when
29 invested in obligations of the United States or the State of Rhode Island, are sufficient to pay all
30 principal, interest, and premium, if any, on the capital development bonds until these bonds are
31 called for prepayment, then such capital development bonds shall not be considered debts of the
32 State of Rhode Island for any purpose starting from the date of deposit of such monies with the

15 SECTION 22. Rhode Island Medicaid Reform Act of 2008 Joint Resolution.
16 WHEREAS, The General Assembly enacted chapter 12.4 of title 42 entitled "The Rhode
17 Island Medicaid Reform Act of 2008"; and
18 WHEREAS, A legislative enactment is required pursuant to Rhode Island General Laws
19 chapter 12.4 of title 42; and
20 WHEREAS, Rhode Island General Laws § 42-7.2-5(3)(i) provides that the Secretary of the
21 Executive Office of Health and Human Services ("Executive Office") is responsible for the
22 implementation of Medicaid policies; and
23 WHEREAS, In pursuit of a higher quality system of care, the General Assembly grants
24 legislative approval of the following proposals and directs the Secretary to implement them; and
25 WHEREAS, If implementation requires changes to rules, regulations, procedures, the
26 Medicaid state plan, and/or the section 1115 waiver, the General Assembly directs and empowers
27 the Secretary to make said changes; further, adoption of new or amended rules, regulations and
28 procedures may also be required:
29 (a) Raising Nursing Facility Personal Needs Allowance. The Executive Office will raise
30 the personal needs allowance for nursing facility residents to two hundred dollars ($200).
31 (b) Medicare Equivalent Rate. The Executive Office will raise all Medicaid rates, except
32 for hospital rates, dental rates, and outpatient behavioral health rates to equal the Medicare
33 equivalent rate. Specific to early intervention services, a payment of fifty dollars ($50.00) per
34 member per month payment shall be established in addition to these rates, and a floor of fifty
LC001571 - Page 89 of 93
1 percent (50%) rate increase shall be established within the calculation of the Medicare equivalent
2 rate.
3 (c) Setting Outpatient Behavioral Healthcare Rates at one hundred fifty percent (150%) of
4 Medicare Equivalent Rates. The Executive Office will set outpatient behavioral health rates at one
5 hundred fifty percent (150%) of the Medicare equivalent rate. The Executive Office will maximize
6 federal financial participation if and when available, though state-only funds will be used if federal
7 financial participation is not available.
8 (d) FQHC APM Modernization. The Executive Office will make certain modifications to
9 modernize and standardize the alternative payment methodology option for federally qualified
10 health centers.
11 (e) Hospital Payment Modernization. The Executive Office will make changes to hospital
12 payment rates to modernize payment methodologies to encourage utilization and quality. Inpatient
13 FFS DRG rates will be set at ninety percent (90%) of the Medicare equivalent rate, inpatient non-
14 DRG FFS rates will be established at ninety-five percent (95%) of the Medicare equivalent rate,
15 inpatient managed care rates will be set at one hundred five percent (105%) of FFS rates, and
16 outpatient rates will be set at one hundred percent (100%) of Medicare rates.
17 (f) RIteShare Freedom of Choice. The Executive Office will make employee participation
18 in the RIteShare program voluntary.
19 (g) Elderly and Disabled Eligibility Expansion. The Executive Office will expand
20 Medicaid eligibility for elderly and disabled residents to one hundred thirty-three percent (133%)
21 of the federal poverty level.
22 (h) Payments Streamlining. The Executive Office will conduct a multifaceted initiative to
23 begin the phase-out of intermediary payers such as managed care entities, streamlining payments
24 and reducing wasteful expenditures on intermediary payers.
25 (i) Medicaid Office Expansion. The Executive Office will expand Medicaid office staffing
26 to improve administrative capacities.
27 (j) End to Health System Transformation Project. The Executive Office will end the Health
28 System Transformation Project to reduce risk exposure to providers and increase the efficiency of
29 the payments system.
30 (k) Rhode Island Mental Health Nursing Facility. The Executive Office will open a state
31 nursing facility to serve patients with significant mental health needs.
32 (l) Raising Nursing Facility Assessment Rate. The Executive Office will raise the nursing
33 facility assessment rate to six percent (6%).
34 (m) Universal Provider Assessment. Consistent with overall goals of transitioning all
LC001571 - Page 90 of 93
1 services to a model where rates are at the Medicare equivalent rate, the Executive Office will extend
2 the existing nursing facility assessment model to cover all providers eligible for taxation under
3 federal regulations to help defray the costs of the state component.
4 (n) Dental Optimization. The Executive Office will make an array of changes to dental
5 benefits offered under Medicaid. Rates will be the rates utilized in § 27-18-54; § 27-19-30.1 § 27-
6 20-25.2; and § 27-41-27.2; billing will be extended to teledentistry services, Silver Diamine
7 Fluoride (code D1354), and denture billing (codes D5130, D5140, D5221, D5222, D5213, and
8 D5214); the mobile dentistry encounter rate will be raised to the FQHC rate; and a fifty percent
9 (50%) payment shall be established for undeliverable dentures.
10 (o) Transition to State-Level Medicare for All. The Executive Office is empowered to
11 begin the process of negotiating the necessary waivers for a transition to a state-level Medicare for
12 All health care payments system for Rhode Island. These waivers shall include the combining of
13 all federal health care funding streams into the system financing including, but not limited to,
14 Medicaid, Medicare, federal health care tax exemptions, and exchange subsides established
15 pursuant to the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. The Executive Office
16 plans to begin the transition process after the completion of the raising of the Medicaid system to
17 a Medicare standard of care and the associated stabilization of the Rhode Island health care
18 workforce and provider network; provided, however, that the Executive Office, understanding the
19 complexity of the proposed waiver application, reserves the right to begin the waiver negotiation
20 process before the transition of Medicaid to a Medicare standard is complete. The Executive Office
21 shall only proceed with the waiver and transition should waiver conditions be favorable to the state
22 as a whole, in the judgment of the Executive Office. In the event that a full waiver cannot be
23 complete, and health insurers have been acquired by the Medicaid Office due to insolvency and the
24 Medicaid Office's goal of payer system stabilization, the Executive Office is empowered to seek
25 limited waivers for the streamlining and integration of acquired health insurers with the Medicaid
26 system. The Executive Office shall submit the final approved waiver and transition plan to the
27 general assembly for final approval.
28 Now, therefore, be it:
29 RESOLVED, That the General Assembly hereby approves the proposals stated above in
30 the recitals; and be it further;
31 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of the Executive Office of Health and Human Services is
32 authorized to pursue and implement any waiver amendments, state plan amendments, and/or
33 changes to the applicable department's rules, regulations and procedures approved herein and as
34 authorized by chapter 12.4 of title 42; and be it further;
LC001571 - Page 91 of 93
1 RESOLVED, That this Joint Resolution shall take effect upon passage.
2 SECTION 23. This act shall take effect upon passage; however, the RICHIP program shall
3 not come into operation until the necessary waivers are obtained, and the final financing proposal
4 is approved by the general assembly.

EXPLANATION
BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL
OF
A N A C T
RELATING TO HEALTH AND SAFETY -- THE RHODE ISLAND COMPREHENSIVE
HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM
***
1 This act would establish a universal, comprehensive, affordable single-payer health care
2 insurance program and help control health care costs, which would be referred to as, "the Rhode
3 Island Comprehensive Health Insurance Program" (RICHIP). The program would be paid for by
4 consolidating government and private payments to multiple insurance carriers into a more
5 economical and efficient improved Medicare-for-all style single-payer program and substituting
6 lower progressive taxes for higher health insurance premiums, co-pays, deductibles and costs due
7 to caps. This program would save Rhode Islanders from the current overly expensive, inefficient
8 and unsustainable multi-payer health insurance system that unnecessarily prevents access to
9 medically necessary health care.
10 This act would take effect upon passage; however, the RICHIP program would not come
11 into operation until the necessary waivers are obtained, and the final financing proposal is approved
12 by the general assembly.

A N A C T
RELATING TO HEALTH AND SAFETY -- THE RHODE ISLAND COMPREHENSIVE
HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM
Introduced By: Representatives Morales, Potter, Tanzi, Batista, Stewart, Cruz, Handy,
and J. Lombardi
Date Introduced: February 12, 2025
Referred To: House Finance
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Title 23 of the General Laws entitled "HEALTH AND SAFETY" is hereby
2 amended by adding thereto the following chapter:
3 CHAPTER 104
4 THE RHODE ISLAND COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM
5 23-104-1. Legislative findings.
6 (1) Health care is a human right, not a commodity available only to those who can afford
7 it;
8 (2) Although the federal Affordable Care Act (ACA) allowed states to offer more people
9 taxpayer subsidized private health insurance, the ACA has not provided universal, comprehensive,
10 affordable coverage for all Rhode Islanders:
11 (i) In 2019, about four and three-tenths percent (4.3%) of Rhode Islanders had no health
12 insurance, causing about forty-three (43) (1 per 1,000 uninsured) unnecessary deaths each year;
13 (ii) An estimated forty-five percent (45%) of Rhode Islanders are under-insured (e.g., not
14 seeking health care because of high deductibles and co-pays);
15 (3) COVID-19 exacerbated and highlighted problems with the status quo health insurance
16 system including:
17 (i) Coverage is too easily lost when health insurance is tied to jobs - between February and
18 May, 2020, about twenty-one thousand (21,000) more Rhode Islanders lost their jobs and their

1 health insurance;
2 (ii) Systemic racism is reinforced - Black and Hispanic/Latinx Rhode Islanders, are more
3 likely to be uninsured or underinsured, have suffered the highest rates of COVID-19 mortality and
4 morbidity;
5 (iii) The fear of out-of-pocket costs for uninsured and underinsured puts everyone at risk
6 because they avoid testing and treatment;
7 (4) In 2016, sixty million (60,000,000) people separated from their job at some point during
8 the year (i.e., about forty-two percent (42%) of the American workforce) and although this act may
9 cause some job loss, on balance, single payer would increase employment in Rhode Island by nearly
10 three percent (3%);
11 (5) The existing US health insurance system has failed to control the cost of health care
12 and to provide universal access to health care in a system which is widely accepted to waste thirty
13 percent (30%) of its revenues on activities that do not improve the health of Americans;
14 (6) Every industrialized nation in the world, except the United States, offers universal
15 health care to its citizens and enjoys better health outcomes for less than two thirds (2/3) to one-
16 half (1/2) the cost;
17 (7) Health care is rationed under our current multi-payer system, despite the fact that Rhode
18 Island patients, businesses and taxpayers already pay enough to have comprehensive and universal
19 health insurance under a single-payer system;
20 (8) About one-third (1/3) of every "healthcare" dollar spent in the U.S. is wasted on
21 unnecessary administrative costs and excessive pharmaceutical company profits due to laws
22 preventing Medicare from negotiating prices and private health insurance companies lacking
23 adequate market share to effectively negotiate prices;
24 (9) Private health insurance companies are incentivized to let the cost of health care rise
25 because higher costs require health insurance companies to charge higher health insurance
26 premiums, increasing companies' revenue and stock price;
27 (10) The healthcare marketplace is not an efficient market and because it represents only
28 eighteen percent (18%) of the US domestic market, significantly restricts economic growth and
29 thus the financial well-being of every American, including every Rhode Islander;
30 (11) Rhode Islanders cannot afford to keep the current multi-payer health insurance system:
31 (i) Between 1991 and 2014, healthcare spending in Rhode Island per person rose by over
32 two hundred fifty percent (250%) rising much faster than income and greatly reducing disposable
33 income;
34 (ii) It is estimated that by 2025, the cost of health insurance for an average family of four
LC001571 - Page 2 of 93

1 (4) will equal about one-half (1/2) of their annual income;
2 (iii) In the U.S., about two-thirds (2/3) of personal bankruptcies are medical cost-related
3 and of these, about three-fourths (3/4) had health insurance at the onset of their medical problems.
4 In no other industrialized country do people worry about going bankrupt over medical costs;
5 (12) Rhode Island private businesses bear most of the costs of employee health insurance
6 coverage and spend significant time and money choosing from a confusing array of increasingly
7 expensive plans which do not provide comprehensive coverage;
8 (13) Rhode Island employees and retirees lose significant wages and pensions as they are
9 forced to pay higher amounts of health insurance and healthcare costs;
10 (14) Rhode Island's hospitals are under increasing financial distress i.e., closing, sold to
11 out-of-state entities, attempting mergers largely due to health insurance reimbursement problems
12 that other nations do not face and are fixed by a single-payer system;
13 (15) The state and its municipalities face enormous other post-employment benefits
14 (OPEB) unfunded liabilities due mostly to health insurance costs;
15 (16) An improved Medicare-for-all style single-payer program would, based on the
16 performance of existing Medicare, eliminate fifty percent (50%) of the administrative waste in the
17 current system of private insurance before other savings achieved through meaningful negotiation
18 of prices and other savings are considered;
19 (17) The high costs of medical care could be lowered significantly if the state could
20 negotiate on behalf of all its residents for bulk purchasing, as well as gain access to usage and price
21 information currently kept confidential by private health insurers as "proprietary information;"
22 (18) Single payer health care would establish a true "free market" system where doctors
23 compete for patients rather than health insurance companies dictating which patients are able to see
24 which doctors and setting reimbursement rates;
25 (19) Healthcare providers would spend significantly less time with administrative work
26 caused by multiple health insurance company requirements and barriers to care delivery and would
27 spend significantly less for overhead costs because of streamlined billing;
28 (20) Rhode Island must act because there are currently no effective state or federal laws
29 that can provide universal coverage and adequately control rising premiums, co-pays, deductibles
30 and medical costs, or prevent private insurance companies from continuing to limit available
31 providers and coverage;
32 (21) In 1962, Canada's successful single-payer program began in the province of
33 Saskatchewan (with approximately the same population as Rhode Island) and became a national
34 program within ten (10) years; and
LC001571 - Page 3 of 93

1 (22) The proposed Rhode Island single payer program was studied by Professor Gerald
2 Friedman at UMass Amherst in 2015 and he concluded that:
3 "Single-payer in Rhode Island will finance medical care with substantial savings compared
4 with the existing multi-payer system of public and private insurers and would improve access to
5 health care by extending coverage to the four percent (4%) of Rhode Island residents still without
6 insurance under the Affordable Care Act and expanding coverage for the growing number with
7 inadequate healthcare coverage. Single-payer would improve the economic health of Rhode Island
8 by: increasing real disposable income for most residents; reducing the burden of health care on
9 businesses and promoting increased employment; and shifting the costs of health care away from
10 working and middle-class residents."
11 23-104-2. Legislative purpose.
12 It is the intent of the general assembly that this chapter establish a universal,
13 comprehensive, affordable single-payer healthcare insurance program that will help control
14 healthcare costs which shall be referred to as, "the Rhode Island comprehensive health insurance
15 program" (RICHIP). The program will be paid for by consolidating government and private
16 payments to multiple insurance carriers into a more economical and efficient improved Medicare-
17 for-all style single-payer program and substituting lower progressive taxes for higher health
18 insurance premiums, co-pays, deductibles and costs in excess of caps. This program will save
19 Rhode Islanders from the current overly expensive, inefficient and unsustainable multi-payer health
20 insurance system that unnecessarily prevents access to medically necessary health care. The
21 program will be established after the standard of care funded by Medicaid has been raised to a
22 Medicare standard.

1 four (4) years. Members shall be appointed by the governor with advice and consent of the senate.
2 Members of the board shall have no pecuniary interest in any health insurance company or any
3 business subject to regulation of the board and cannot have previously worked for a health
4 insurance company. The duties of the board shall include:
5 (1) Annually establish a RICHIP benefits package for participants, including a formulary
6 and a list of other medically necessary goods, as well as a procedure for handling complaints and
7 appeals relating to the benefits package, pursuant to § 23-104-6.
8 (2) Establish RICHIP provider reimbursement and a procedure for handling provider
9 complaints and appeals as set forth in § 23-104-9;
10 (3) Review budget proposals from providers pursuant to § 23-104-11(b); and
11 (4) The board shall be subject to chapter 46 of title 42 ("open meetings").
12 23-104-5. Coverage.
13 (a) All qualified Rhode Island residents may participate in RICHIP. The director shall
14 establish procedures to determine eligibility, enrollment, disenrollment and disqualification,
15 including criteria and procedures by which RICHIP can:
16 (1) Identify, automatically enroll, and provide a RICHIP card to qualified Rhode Island
17 residents;
18 (2) Process applications from individuals seeking to obtain RICHIP coverage for
19 dependents after the implementation date;
20 (3) Ensure eligible residents are knowledgeable and aware of their rights to health care;
21 (4) Determine whether an individual should be disenrolled (e.g., for leaving the state);
22 (5) Determine whether an individual should be disqualified (e.g., for fraudulent receipt of
23 benefits or reimbursements);
24 (6) Determine appropriate actions that should be taken with respect to individuals who are
25 disenrolled or disqualified (including civil and criminal penalties); and
26 (7) Permit individuals to request review and appeal decisions to disenroll or disqualify
27 them.
28 (b) Medicare and Medicaid eligible coverage under RICHIP shall be as follows:
29 (1) If all necessary federal waivers are obtained, qualified Rhode Island residents eligible
30 for federal Medicare ("Medicare eligible residents") shall continue to pay required fees to the
31 federal government. RICHIP shall establish procedures to ensure that Medicare eligible residents
32 shall have such amounts deducted from what they owe to RICHIP under § 23-104-12(h). RICHIP
33 shall become the equivalent of qualifying coverage under Medicare part D and Medicare advantage
34 programs, and as such shall be the vendor for coverage to RICHIP participants. RICHIP shall
LC001571 - Page 8 of 93

1 provide Medicare eligible residents benefits equal to those available to all other RICHIP
2 participants and equal to or greater than those available through the federal Medicare program. To
3 streamline the process, RICHIP shall seek to receive federal reimbursements for services and goods
4 to Medicare eligible residents and administer all Medicare funds.
5 (2) If all necessary federal waivers are obtained, RICHIP shall become the state's sole
6 Medicaid provider. RICHIP shall create procedures to enroll all qualified Rhode Island residents
7 eligible for Medicaid ("Medicaid eligible residents") in the federal Medicaid program to ensure a
8 maximum amount of federal Medicaid funds go to the RICHIP trust fund. RICHIP shall provide
9 benefits to Medicaid eligible residents equal to those available to all other RICHIP participants.
10 (3) If all necessary federal waivers are not granted from the Medicaid or Medicare
11 programs operated under Title XVIII or XIX of the Social Security Act, the Medicaid or Medicare
12 program for which a waiver is not granted shall act as the primary insurer for those eligible for such
13 coverage, and RICHIP shall serve as the secondary or supplemental plan of health insurance
14 coverage. Until such time as a waiver is granted, the plan shall not pay for services for persons
15 otherwise eligible for the same healthcare benefits under the Medicaid or Medicare program. The
16 director shall establish procedures for determining amounts owed by Medicare and Medicaid
17 eligible residents for supplemental RICHIP coverage and the extent of such coverage.
18 (4) The director may require Rhode Island residents to provide information necessary to
19 determine whether the resident is eligible for a federally matched public health program or for
20 Medicare, or any program or benefit under Medicare.
21 (5) As a condition of eligibility or continued eligibility for healthcare services under
22 RICHIP, a qualified Rhode Island resident who is eligible for benefits under Medicare shall enroll
23 in Medicare, including Parts A, B, and D.
24 (c) Veterans. RICHIP shall serve as the secondary or supplemental plan of health insurance
25 coverage for military veterans. The director shall establish procedures for determining amounts
26 owed by military veterans who are qualified residents for such supplemental RICHIP coverage and
27 the extent of such coverage.
28 (d) This chapter does not create any employment benefit, nor require, prohibit, or limit the
29 providing of any employment benefit.
30 (e) This chapter does not affect or limit collective action or collective bargaining on the
31 part of a healthcare provider with their employer or any other lawful collective action or collective
32 bargaining.
33 23-104-6. Benefits.

LC001571 - Page 10 of 93

1 recommendations, and the views of physicians practicing in relevant clinical areas and any other
2 relevant factors. The director shall create procedures for handling complaints and appeals
3 concerning the benefits package.
4 (c) Restrictions shall not apply. In order for RICHIP participants to be able to receive
5 medically necessary goods and services, this chapter shall override any state law that restricts the
6 provision or use of state funds for any medically necessary goods or services, including those
7 related to family planning and reproductive healthcare.
8 (d) Medically necessary goods:
9 (1) Prescription drug formulary:
10 (i) In general. The director shall establish a prescription drug formulary system, to be
11 approved by the board, and encourage best-practices in prescribing and discourage the use of
12 ineffective, dangerous, or excessively costly medications when better alternatives are available.
13 (ii) Promotion of generics. The formulary under this subsection shall promote the use of
14 generic medications to the greatest extent possible.
15 (iii) Formulary updates and petition rights. The formulary under this subsection shall be
16 updated frequently and the director shall create a procedure for patients and providers to make
17 requests and appeal denials to add new pharmaceuticals or to remove ineffective or dangerous
18 medications from the formulary.
19 (iv) Use of off-formulary medications. The director shall promulgate rules regarding the
20 use of off-formulary medications which allow for patient access but do not compromise the
21 formulary.
22 (v) Approved devices and equipment. The director shall present a list of medically
23 necessary devices and equipment that shall be covered by RICHIP, subject to final approval by the
24 board.
25 (vi) Bulk purchasing. The director shall seek and implement ways to obtain goods at the
26 lowest possible cost, including bulk purchasing agreements.
27 23-104-7. Providers.
28 (a) Rhode Island providers.
29 (1) Licensing. Participating providers shall meet state licensing requirements in order to
30 participate in RICHIP. No provider whose license is under suspension or has been revoked shall
31 participate in the program.
32 (2) Participation. All providers may participate in RICHIP by providing items on the
33 RICHIP benefits list for which they are licensed. Providers may elect either to participate fully, or
34 not at all, in the program.
LC001571 - Page 11 of 93

1 (3) For-profit providers. For-profit providers may continue to offer services and goods in
2 Rhode Island, but are prohibited from charging patients more than RICHIP reimbursement rates
3 for covered services and goods and shall notify qualified Rhode Island residents when the services
4 and goods they offer will not be reimbursed fully under RICHIP.
5 (b) Out-of-state providers. Except for emergency and urgently needed service, as set forth
6 in § 23-104-7(d), RICHIP shall not pay for healthcare services obtained outside of Rhode Island
7 unless the following requirements are met:
8 (1) The out-of-state provider agrees to accept the RICHIP rate for out-of-state providers;
9 and
10 (2) The services are medically necessary care.
11 (c) Out-of-state provider reimbursement. The program shall pay out-of-state healthcare
12 providers at a rate equal to the average rate paid by commercial insurers or Medicare for the services
13 rendered, whichever is higher.
14 (d) Out-of-state residents.
15 (1) In general. Rhode Island providers who provide any services to individuals who are not
16 RICHIP participants shall not be reimbursed by RICHIP and shall seek reimbursement from those
17 individuals or other sources.
18 (2) Emergency care exception. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent any individual from
19 receiving or any provider from providing emergency healthcare services and goods in Rhode
20 Island. The director shall adopt rules to provide reimbursement; however, the rules shall reasonably
21 limit reimbursement to protect the fiscal integrity of RICHIP. The director shall implement
22 procedures to secure reimbursement from any appropriate third-party funding source or from the
23 individual to whom the emergency services were rendered.
24 23-104-8. Cross border employees.
25 (a) State residents employed out-of-state. If an individual is employed out-of-state by an
26 employer that is subject to Rhode Island state law, the employer and employee shall be required to
27 pay the payroll taxes as to that employee as if the employment were in the state. If an individual is
28 employed out-of-state by an employer that is not subject to Rhode Island state law, the employee
29 health coverage provided by the out-of-state employer to a resident working out-of-state shall serve
30 as the employee's primary plan of health coverage, and RICHIP shall serve as the employee's
31 secondary plan of health coverage. The director shall establish procedures for determining amounts
32 owed by residents employed out-of-state for such supplemental secondary RICHIP coverage and
33 the extent of such coverage.
34 (b) Out-of-state residents employed in the state. The payroll tax set forth in § 23-104-12(i)
LC001571 - Page 12 of 93

1 shall apply to any out-of-state resident who is employed or self-employed in the state. However,
2 such out-of-state residents shall be able to take a credit for amounts they spend on health benefits
3 for themselves that would otherwise be covered by RICHIP if the individual were a RICHIP
4 participant. The out-of-state resident's employer shall be able to take a credit against such payroll
5 taxes regardless of the form of the health benefit (e.g., health insurance, a self-insured plan, direct
6 services, or reimbursement for services), to ensure that the revenue proposal does not relate to
7 employment benefits in violation of the Federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act
8 ("ERISA") law. For non-employment-based spending by individuals, the credit shall be available
9 for and limited to spending for health coverage (not out-of-pocket health spending). The credit shall
10 be available without regard to how little is spent or how sparse the benefit. The credit may only be
11 taken against the payroll taxes set forth in § 23-104-12(i). Any excess amount may not be applied
12 to other tax liability. For employment-based health benefits, the credit shall be distributed between
13 the employer and employee in the same proportion as the spending by each for the benefit. The
14 employer and employee may each apply their respective portion of the credit to their respective
15 portion of the payroll taxes set forth in § 23-104-12(i). If any provision of this clause or any
16 application of it shall be ruled to violate ERISA, the provision or the application of it shall be null
17 and void and the ruling shall not affect any other provision or application of this section or this
18 chapter.
19 23-104-9. Provider reimbursement.
20 (a) Rates for services and goods. RICHIP reimbursement rates to providers shall be
21 determined by the RICHIP board. These rates shall be equal to or greater than the federal Medicare
22 rates available to Rhode Island qualified residents that are in effect at the time services and goods
23 are provided. For outpatient behavioral health services, the minimum rate shall equal one hundred
24 fifty percent (150%) of federal Medicare rates. If the director determines that there are no such
25 federal Medicare reimbursement rates, the director shall set the minimum rate. The director shall
26 review the rates at least annually, recommend changes to the board, and establish procedures by
27 which complaints about reimbursement rates may be reviewed by the board.
28 (b) Billing and payments. Providers shall submit billing for services to RICHIP participants
29 in the form of electronic invoices entered into RIFANS, the state's computerized financial system.
30 The director shall coordinate the manner of processing and payment with the office of accounts and
31 control and the RIFANS support team within the division of information technology. Payments
32 shall be made by check or electronic funds transfer in accordance with terms and procedures
33 coordinated by the director and the office of accounts and control and consistent with the fiduciary
34 management of the RICHIP trust fund.
LC001571 - Page 13 of 93

1 (c) Provider restrictions. In-state providers who accept any payment from RICHIP shall
2 not bill any patient for any covered benefit. In-state providers cannot use any of their operating
3 budgets for expansion, profit, excessive executive income, including bonuses, marketing, or major
4 capital purchases or leases.
5 23-104-10. Private insurance companies.
6 (a) Non-duplication. It is unlawful for a private health insurer to sell health insurance
7 coverage to qualified Rhode Island residents that duplicates the benefits provided under this
8 chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as prohibiting the sale of health insurance
9 coverage for any additional benefits not covered by this chapter, including additional benefits that
10 an employer may provide to employees or their dependents, or to former employees or their
11 dependents (e.g., multiemployer plans can continue to provide wrap-around coverage for any
12 benefits not provided by RICHIP).
13 (b) Displaced employees. Re-education and job placement of persons employed in Rhode
14 Island-located enterprises who have lost their jobs as a result of this chapter shall be managed by
15 the Rhode Island department of labor and training or an appropriate federal retraining program. The
16 director may provide funds from RICHIP or funds otherwise appropriated for this purpose for
17 retraining and assisting job transition for individuals employed or previously employed in the fields
18 of health insurance, healthcare service plans, and other third-party payments for health care or those
19 individuals providing services to healthcare providers to deal with third-party payers for health
20 care, whose jobs may be or have been ended as a result of the implementation of the program,
21 consistent with applicable laws.
22 23-104-11. Budgeting.
23 (a) Operating budget. Annually, the director shall create an operating budget for the
24 program that includes the costs for all benefits set forth in § 23-104-5 and the costs for RICHIP
25 administration. The director shall determine appropriate reimbursement rates for benefits pursuant
26 to § 23-104-9(a). The operating budget shall be approved by the executive board prior to
27 submission to the governor and general assembly.
28 (b) Capital expenditures. The director shall work with representatives from state entities
29 involved with provider capital expenditures (e.g., the Rhode Island department of administration
30 office of capital projects, the Rhode Island health and educational building corporation, etc.), and
31 providers to help ensure that capital expenditures proposed by providers, including amounts to be
32 spent on construction and renovation of health facilities and major equipment purchases, will
33 address healthcare needs of RICHIP participants. To the extent that providers are seeking to use
34 RICHIP funds for capital expenditures, the director shall have the authority to approve or deny such
LC001571 - Page 14 of 93

1 expenditures.
2 (c) Prohibition against co-mingling operations and capital improvement funds. It is
3 prohibited to use funds under this chapter that are earmarked:
4 (1) For operations for capital expenditures; or
5 (2) For capital expenditures for operations.
6 23-104-12. Financing.
7 (a) RICHIP trust fund. There shall be established a RICHIP trust fund into which funds
8 collected pursuant to this chapter are deposited and from which funds are distributed. All money
9 collected and received shall be used exclusively to finance RICHIP. The governor or general
10 assembly may provide funds to the RICHIP trust fund, but may not remove or borrow funds from
11 the RICHIP trust fund.
12 (b) Revenue proposal. After approval of the RICHIP executive board, the director shall
13 submit to the governor and the general assembly a revenue plan and, if required, legislation
14 (referred to collectively in this section as the "revenue proposal") to provide the revenue necessary
15 to finance RICHIP. The initial revenue proposal shall be submitted once waiver negotiations have
16 proceeded to a level deemed sufficient by the director and annually, thereafter. The basic structure
17 of the initial revenue proposal will be based on a consideration of:
18 (1) Anticipated savings from a single payer program;
19 (2) Government funds available for health care;
20 (3) Private funds available for health care; and
21 (4) Replacing current regressive health insurance payments made to multiple health
22 insurance carriers with progressive contributions to a single payer (RICHIP) in order to make
23 healthcare insurance affordable and remove unnecessary barriers to healthcare access.
24 Subsequent proposals shall adjust the RICHIP contributions, based on projections from the
25 total RICHIP costs in the previous year, and shall include a five (5) year plan for adjusting RICHIP
26 contributions to best meet the goals set forth in this section and § 23-104-2.
27 (c) Anticipated savings. It is anticipated that RICHIP will lower healthcare costs by:
28 (1) Eliminating payments to private health insurance carriers;
29 (2) Reducing paperwork and administrative expenses for both providers and payers created
30 by the marketing, sales, eligibility checks, network contract management, issues associated
31 multiple benefit packages, and other administrative waste associated with the current multi-payer
32 private health insurance system;
33 (3) Allowing the planning and delivery of a public health strategy for the entire population
34 of Rhode Island;
LC001571 - Page 15 of 93

1 (4) Improving access to preventive healthcare; and
2 (5) Negotiating on behalf of the state for bulk purchasing of medical supplies and
3 pharmaceuticals.
4 (d) Federal funds. The executive office of health and human services, in collaboration with
5 the director, the board and the Medicaid office, shall seek and obtain waivers and other approvals
6 relating to Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program, Medicare, federal tax exemptions
7 for health care, the ACA, and any other relevant federal programs in order that:
8 (1) Federal funds and other subsidies for health care that would otherwise be paid to the
9 state and its residents and healthcare providers, would be paid by the federal government to the
10 state and deposited into the RICHIP trust fund;
11 (2) Programs would be waived and such funding from federal programs in Rhode Island
12 would be replaced or merged into RICHIP in order that it can operate as a single payer program;
13 (3) Maximum federal funding for health care is sought even if any necessary waivers or
14 approvals are not obtained and multiple sources of funding with RICHIP trust fund monies are
15 pooled, in order that RICHIP can act as much as possible like a single payer program to maximize
16 benefits to Rhode Islanders; and
17 (4) Federal financial participation in the programs that are incorporated into RICHIP are
18 not jeopardized.
19 (e) State funds. State funds that would otherwise be appropriated to any governmental
20 agency, office, program, instrumentality, or institution for services and benefits covered under
21 RICHIP shall be directed into the RICHIP trust fund. Payments to the fund pursuant to this section
22 shall be in an amount equal to the money appropriated for those purposes in the fiscal year
23 beginning immediately preceding the effective date of this chapter.
24 (f) Private funds. Private grants (e.g., from nonprofit corporations) and other funds
25 specifically ear-marked for health care (e.g., from litigation against tobacco companies, opioid
26 manufacturers, etc.), shall also be put into the RICHIP trust fund.
27 (g) Assignments from RICHIP participants. Receipt of healthcare services under the plan
28 shall be deemed an assignment by the RICHIP participant of any right to payment for services from
29 a policy of insurance, a health benefit plan or other source. The other source of healthcare benefits
30 shall pay to the fund all amounts it is obligated to pay to, or on behalf of, the RICHIP participant
31 for covered healthcare services. The director may commence any action necessary to recover the
32 amounts due.
33 (h) Replacing current health insurance payments with progressive contributions. Instead of
34 making health insurance payments to multiple carriers (i.e., for premiums, co-pays deductibles, and
LC001571 - Page 16 of 93

1 costs in excess of caps) for limited coverage, individuals and entities subject to Rhode Island
2 taxation pursuant to § 44-30-1 shall pay progressive contributions to the RICHIP trust fund
3 (referred to collectively in this section as the "RICHIP contributions") for comprehensive coverage.
4 These RICHIP contributions shall be set and adjusted over time to an appropriate level to:
5 (1) Cover the actual cost of the program;
6 (2) Ensure that higher brackets of income subject to specified taxes shall be assessed at a
7 higher marginal rate than lower brackets; and
8 (3) Protect the economic welfare of small businesses, low-income earners and working
9 families through tax credits or exemptions.
10 (i) Contributions based on earned income. The amounts currently paid by employers and
11 employees for health insurance shall initially be replaced by a ten percent (10%) payroll tax, based
12 on the projected average payroll of employees over three (3) previous calendar years. The employer
13 shall pay eighty percent (80%) and the employee shall pay twenty percent (20%) of this payroll
14 tax, except that an employer may agree to pay all or part of the employee's share. Self- employed
15 individuals shall initially pay one-hundred percent (100%) of the payroll tax. The ten percent (10%)
16 initial rate will be adjusted by the director in order that higher brackets of income subject to these
17 taxes shall be assessed at a higher marginal rate than lower brackets and in order that small
18 businesses and lower income earners receive a credit or exemption.
19 (j) Contributions based on unearned income. There shall be a progressive contribution
20 based on unearned income, i.e., capital gains, dividends, interest, profits, and rents. Initially, the
21 unearned income RICHIP contributions shall be equal to ten percent (10%) of such unearned
22 income. The ten percent (10%) initial rate may be adjusted by the director to allow for a graduated
23 progressive exemption or credit for individuals with lower unearned income levels.
24 23-104-13. Implementation.
25 (a) State laws and regulations.
26 (1) In general. The director shall work with the executive board and receive such assistance
27 as may be necessary from other state agencies and entities to examine state laws and regulations
28 and to make recommendations necessary to conform such laws and regulations to properly
29 implement the RICHIP program. The director shall report recommendations to the governor and
30 the general assembly.
31 (2) Anti-trust laws. The intent of this chapter is to exempt activities provided for under this
32 chapter from state antitrust laws and to provide immunity from federal antitrust laws through the
33 state action doctrine.
34 (b) The director shall complete an implementation plan to provide healthcare coverage for
LC001571 - Page 17 of 93

1 qualified residents in accordance with this chapter within twelve (12) months of its effective date.
2 (c) The executive office of health and human services, in collaboration with the director,
3 the board, and the Medicaid director, will have the initial responsibility of negotiating the waivers.
4 (d) Severability. If any provision or application of this chapter shall be held to be invalid,
5 or to violate or be inconsistent with any applicable federal law or regulation, that shall not affect
6 other provisions or applications of this chapter which can be given effect without that provision or
7 application; and to that end, the provisions and applications of this chapter are severable.

9 Services" is hereby amended by adding thereto the following section:
10 22-11-4.1. Employees needed to maximize federal Medicaid funding.

7 subsidiary of them, hereinafter "the insurer," is subject to an order from the superior court directing
8 the director to rehabilitate, liquidate, or conserve, as provided in §§ 27-19-28, 27-20-24, 27-41-18,
9 or chapter 14.1, 14.2, 14.3, or 14.4 of this title., certain additional conditions shall apply to the

19 requirements of this chapter.
20 SECTION 6. Section 28-57-5 of the General Laws in Chapter 28-57 entitled "Healthy and
21 Safe Families and Workplaces Act" is hereby amended to read as follows:
22 28-57-5. Accrual of paid sick and safe leave time.
23 (a) All employees employed by an employer of eighteen (18) or more employees in Rhode
24 Island shall accrue a minimum of one hour of paid sick and safe leave time for every thirty five
25 (35) hours worked up to a maximum of twenty-four (24) hours during calendar year 2018, thirty-
26 two (32) hours during calendar year 2019, and up to a maximum of forty (40) hours per year from
27 calendar year 2020 through calendar year 2026, and one hundred sixty (160) hours per year
28 thereafter, unless the employer chooses to provide a higher annual limit in both accrual and use. In
29 determining the number of employees who are employed by an employer for compensation, all
30 employees defined in § 28-57-3(7) shall be counted.
31 (b) Employees who are exempt from the overtime requirements under 29 U.S.C. §
32 213(a)(1) of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. § 201 et seq., will be assumed to work
33 forty (40) hours in each workweek for purposes of paid sick and safe leave time accrual unless their
34 normal workweek is less than forty (40) hours, in which case paid sick and safe leave time accrues
LC001571 - Page 20 of 93

1 based upon that normal workweek.
2 (c) Paid sick and safe leave time as provided in this chapter shall begin to accrue at the
3 commencement of employment or pursuant to the law’s effective date [July 1, 2018], whichever is

5 accrue in a year at the beginning of the year.
6 (d) An employer may require a waiting period for newly hired employees of up to ninety
7 (90) days. During this waiting period, an employee shall accrue earned sick time pursuant to this
8 section or the employer’s policy, if exempt under § 28-57-4(b), but shall not be permitted to use
9 the earned sick time until after he or she has completed the waiting period.
10 (e) Paid sick and safe leave time shall be carried over to the following calendar year;
11 however, an employee’s use of paid sick and safe leave time provided under this chapter in each
12 calendar year shall not exceed twenty-four (24) hours during calendar year 2018, and thirty-two
13 (32) hours during calendar year 2019, and forty (40) hours per year thereafter. Alternatively, in lieu
14 of carryover of unused earned paid sick and safe leave time from one year to the next, an employer
15 may pay an employee for unused earned paid sick and safe leave time at the end of a year and
16 provide the employee with an amount of paid sick and safe leave that meets or exceeds the
17 requirements of this chapter that is available for the employee’s immediate use at the beginning of
18 the subsequent year.
19 (f) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as requiring financial or other reimbursement
20 to an employee from an employer upon the employee’s termination, resignation, retirement, or
21 other separation from employment for accrued paid sick and safe leave time that has not been used.
22 (g) If an employee is transferred to a separate division, entity, or location within the state,
23 but remains employed by the same employer as defined in 29 C.F.R. § 791.2 of the federal Fair
24 Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. § 201 et seq., the employee is entitled to all paid sick and safe leave
25 time accrued at the prior division, entity, or location and is entitled to use all paid sick and safe
26 leave time as provided in this act. When there is a separation from employment and the employee
27 is rehired within one hundred thirty-five (135) days of separation by the same employer, previously
28 accrued paid sick and safe leave time that had not been used shall be reinstated. Further, the
29 employee shall be entitled to use accrued paid sick and safe leave time and accrue additional sick
30 and safe leave time at the re-commencement of employment.
31 (h) When a different employer succeeds or takes the place of an existing employer, all
32 employees of the original employer who remain employed by the successor employer within the
33 state are entitled to all earned paid sick and safe leave time they accrued when employed by the
34 original employer, and are entitled to use earned paid sick and safe leave time previously accrued.
LC001571 - Page 21 of 93

1 (i) At its discretion, an employer may loan sick and safe leave time to an employee in
2 advance of accrual by such employee.
3 (j) Temporary employees shall be entitled to use accrued paid sick and safe leave time
4 beginning on the one hundred eightieth (180) calendar day following commencement of their
5 employment, unless otherwise permitted by the employer. On and after the one hundred eightieth
6 (180) calendar day of employment, employees may use paid sick and safe leave time as it is
7 accrued. During this waiting period, an employee shall accrue earned sick time pursuant to this
8 chapter, but shall not be permitted to use the earned sick time until after he or she has completed
9 the waiting period.
10 (k) Seasonal employees shall be entitled to use accrued paid sick and safe leave time
11 beginning on the one hundred fiftieth (150) calendar day following commencement of their
12 employment, unless otherwise permitted by the employer. On and after the one hundred fiftieth
13 (150) calendar day of employment, employees may use paid sick and safe leave time as it is
14 accrued. During this waiting period, an employee shall accrue earned sick time pursuant to this
15 chapter, but shall not be permitted to use the earned sick time until after he or she has completed
16 the waiting period.

13 17.14 of title 23 (hospital conversions) and § 23-17-6(b) (change in effective control), that provides
14 short-term, acute inpatient and/or outpatient care to persons who require definitive diagnosis and
15 treatment for injury, illness, disabilities, or pregnancy. Notwithstanding the preceding language,
16 the Medicaid managed care payment rates for a court-approved purchaser that acquires a hospital
17 through receivership, special mastership or other similar state insolvency proceedings (which court-
18 approved purchaser is issued a hospital license after January 1, 2013), shall be based upon the new
19 rates between the court-approved purchaser and the health plan, and such rates shall be effective as
20 of the date that the court-approved purchaser and the health plan execute the initial agreement
21 containing the new rates. The rate-setting methodology for inpatient-hospital payments and
22 outpatient-hospital payments set forth in subsections (b)(1)(ii)(C) and (b)(2), respectively, shall
23 thereafter apply to increases for each annual twelve-month (12) period as of July 1 following the
24 completion of the first full year of the court-approved purchaser’s initial Medicaid managed care
25 contract.
26 (c) It is intended that payment utilizing phasing out the DRG method shall reward hospitals
27 for providing the most efficient highest quality care, and provide the executive office the
28 opportunity to conduct value-based purchasing of inpatient care.
29 (d) The secretary of the executive office is hereby authorized to promulgate such rules and
30 regulations consistent with this chapter, and to establish fiscal procedures he or she deems
31 necessary, for the proper implementation and administration of this chapter in order to provide
32 payment to hospitals using the DRG-payment methodology. Furthermore, amendment of the Rhode
33 Island state plan for Medicaid, pursuant to Title XIX of the federal Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.
34 § 1396 et seq., is hereby authorized to provide for payment to hospitals for services provided to
LC001571 - Page 29 of 93

1 eligible recipients in accordance with this chapter.
2 (e) The executive office shall comply with all public notice requirements necessary to
3 implement these rate changes.
4 (f) As a condition of participation in the DRG methodology for payment of hospital
5 services, every hospital shall submit year-end settlement reports to the executive office within one
6 year from the close of a hospital’s fiscal year. Should a participating hospital fail to timely submit
7 a year-end settlement report as required by this section, the executive office shall withhold
8 financial-cycle payments due by any state agency with respect to this hospital by not more than ten
9 percent (10%) until the report is submitted. For hospital fiscal year 2010 and all subsequent fiscal
10 years, hospitals will not be required to submit year-end settlement reports on payments for
11 outpatient services. For hospital fiscal year 2011 and all subsequent fiscal years, hospitals will not
12 be required to submit year-end settlement reports on claims for hospital inpatient services. Further,
13 for hospital fiscal year 2010, hospital inpatient claims subject to settlement shall include only those
14 claims received between October 1, 2009, and June 30, 2010.
15 (g) The provisions of this section shall be effective upon implementation of the new
16 payment methodology set forth in this section and § 40-8-13.3, which shall in any event be no later
17 than March 30, 2010, at which time the provisions of §§ 40-8-13.2, 27-19-14, 27-19-15, and 27-
18 19-16 shall be repealed in their entirety.
19 40-8-16. Notification of long-term care alternative.
20 (a) The department of human services, before authorizing care in a nursing home or
21 intermediate-care facility for a person who is eligible to receive benefits pursuant to Title XIX of
22 the federal Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq., and who is being discharged from a
23 hospital to a nursing home, shall notify the person, in writing, of the provisions of the long-term-
24 care alternative, a home- and a community-based program.
25 (b) If a person, eligible to receive benefits pursuant to Title XIX of the federal Social
26 Security Act, requires services in a nursing home and desires to remain in his or her own home or
27 the home of a responsible relative or other adult, the person or his or her representative shall so
28 inform the department.
29 (c) The department shall not make payments pursuant to Title XIX of the federal Social
30 Security Act for benefits until written notification documenting the person’s choice as to a nursing
31 home or home- and community-based services has been filed with the department.
32 40-8-19. Rates of payment to nursing facilities.
33 (a) Rate reform.
34 (1) The rates to be paid by the state to nursing facilities licensed pursuant to chapter 17 of
LC001571 - Page 30 of 93

1 title 23, and certified to participate in Title XIX of the Social Security Act for services rendered to
2 Medicaid-eligible residents, shall be reasonable and adequate to meet the costs that must be
3 incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities in accordance with 42 U.S.C. §
4 1396a(a)(13). The executive office of health and human services (“executive office”) shall
5 promulgate or modify the principles of reimbursement for nursing facilities in effect as of July 1,
6 2011, to be consistent with the provisions of this section and Title XIX, 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq.,
7 of the Social Security Act.
8 (2) The executive office shall review the current methodology for providing Medicaid
9 payments to nursing facilities, including other long-term care services providers, and is authorized
10 to modify the principles of reimbursement to replace the current cost-based methodology rates with
11 rates based on a price-based methodology to be paid to all facilities with recognition of the acuity
12 of patients and the relative Medicaid occupancy, and to include the following elements to be
13 developed by the executive office:
14 (i) A direct-care rate adjusted for resident acuity;
15 (ii) An indirect-care and other direct-care rate comprised of a base per diem for all facilities;
16 (iii) Revision of rates as necessary based on increases in direct and indirect costs beginning
17 October 2024 utilizing data from the most recent finalized year of facility cost report. The per diem
18 rate components deferred in subsections (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(ii) of this section shall be adjusted
19 accordingly to reflect changes in direct and indirect care costs since the previous rate review;
20 (iv) Application of a fair-rental value system;
21 (v) Application of a pass-through system; and
22 (vi) Adjustment of rates by the change in a recognized national nursing home inflation
23 index to be applied on October 1 of each year, beginning October 1, 2012. This adjustment will not
24 occur on October 1, 2013, October 1, 2014, or October 1, 2015, but will occur on April 1, 2015.
25 The adjustment of rates will also not occur on October 1, 2017, October 1, 2018, October 1, 2019,
26 and October 2022. Effective July 1, 2018, rates paid to nursing facilities from the rates approved
27 by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and in effect on October 1, 2017, both fee-for-
28 service and managed care, will be increased by one and one-half percent (1.5%) and further
29 increased by one percent (1%) on October 1, 2018, and further increased by one percent (1%) on
30 October 1, 2019. Effective October 1, 2022, rates paid to nursing facilities from the rates approved
31 by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and in effect on October 1, 2021, both fee-for-
32 service and managed care, will be increased by three percent (3%). In addition to the annual nursing
33 home inflation index adjustment, there shall be a base rate staffing adjustment of one-half percent
34 (0.5%) on October 1, 2021, one percent (1.0%) on October 1, 2022, and one and one-half percent
LC001571 - Page 31 of 93

1 (1.5%) on October 1, 2023. The inflation index shall be applied without regard for the transition
2 factors in subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2). For purposes of October 1, 2016, adjustment only, any rate
3 increase that results from application of the inflation index to subsections (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(ii)
4 shall be dedicated to increase compensation for direct-care workers in the following manner: Not
5 less than 85% of this aggregate amount shall be expended to fund an increase in wages, benefits,
6 or related employer costs of direct-care staff of nursing homes. For purposes of this section, direct-
7 care staff shall include registered nurses (RNs), licensed practical nurses (LPNs), certified nursing
8 assistants (CNAs), certified medical technicians, housekeeping staff, laundry staff, dietary staff, or
9 other similar employees providing direct-care services; provided, however, that this definition of
10 direct-care staff shall not include: (i) RNs and LPNs who are classified as “exempt employees”
11 under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C. § 201 et seq.); or (ii) CNAs, certified medical
12 technicians, RNs, or LPNs who are contracted, or subcontracted, through a third-party vendor or
13 staffing agency. By July 31, 2017, nursing facilities shall submit to the secretary, or designee, a
14 certification that they have complied with the provisions of this subsection (a)(2)(vi) with respect
15 to the inflation index applied on October 1, 2016. Any facility that does not comply with the terms
16 of such certification shall be subjected to a clawback, paid by the nursing facility to the state, in the
17 amount of increased reimbursement subject to this provision that was not expended in compliance
18 with that certification.
19 (3) Commencing on October 1, 2021, eighty percent (80%) of any rate increase that results
20 from application of the inflation index to subsections (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(ii) of this section shall be
21 dedicated to increase compensation for all eligible direct-care workers in the following manner on
22 October 1, of each year.
23 (i) For purposes of this subsection, compensation increases shall include base salary or
24 hourly wage increases, benefits, other compensation, and associated payroll tax increases for
25 eligible direct-care workers. This application of the inflation index shall apply for Medicaid
26 reimbursement in nursing facilities for both managed care and fee-for-service. For purposes of this
27 subsection, direct-care staff shall include registered nurses (RNs), licensed practical nurses (LPNs),
28 certified nursing assistants (CNAs), certified medication technicians, licensed physical therapists,
29 licensed occupational therapists, licensed speech-language pathologists, mental health workers
30 who are also certified nurse assistants, physical therapist assistants, housekeeping staff, laundry
31 staff, dietary staff, or other similar employees providing direct-care services; provided, however
32 that this definition of direct-care staff shall not include:
33 (A) RNs and LPNs who are classified as “exempt employees” under the federal Fair Labor
34 Standards Act (29 U.S.C. § 201 et seq.); or
LC001571 - Page 32 of 93

1 (B) CNAs, certified medication technicians, RNs, or LPNs who are contracted or
2 subcontracted through a third-party vendor or staffing agency.
3 (4)(i) By July 31, 2021, and July 31 of each year thereafter, nursing facilities shall submit
4 to the secretary or designee a certification that they have complied with the provisions of subsection
5 (a)(3) of this section with respect to the inflation index applied on October 1. The executive office
6 of health and human services (EOHHS) shall create the certification form nursing facilities must
7 complete with information on how each individual eligible employee’s compensation increased,
8 including information regarding hourly wages prior to the increase and after the compensation
9 increase, hours paid after the compensation increase, and associated increased payroll taxes. A
10 collective bargaining agreement can be used in lieu of the certification form for represented
11 employees. All data reported on the compliance form is subject to review and audit by EOHHS.
12 The audits may include field or desk audits, and facilities may be required to provide additional
13 supporting documents including, but not limited to, payroll records.
14 (ii) Any facility that does not comply with the terms of certification shall be subjected to a
15 clawback and twenty-five percent (25%) penalty of the unspent or impermissibly spent funds, paid
16 by the nursing facility to the state, in the amount of increased reimbursement subject to this
17 provision that was not expended in compliance with that certification.
18 (iii) In any calendar year where no inflationary index is applied, eighty percent (80%) of
19 the base rate staffing adjustment in that calendar year pursuant to subsection (a)(2)(vi) of this
20 section shall be dedicated to increase compensation for all eligible direct-care workers in the
21 manner referenced in subsections (a)(3)(i), (a)(3)(i)(A), and (a)(3)(i)(B) of this section.
22 (b) Transition to full implementation of rate reform. For no less than four (4) years after
23 the initial application of the price-based methodology described in subsection (a)(2) to payment
24 rates, the executive office of health and human services shall implement a transition plan to
25 moderate the impact of the rate reform on individual nursing facilities. The transition shall include
26 the following components:
27 (1) No nursing facility shall receive reimbursement for direct-care costs that is less than
28 the rate of reimbursement for direct-care costs received under the methodology in effect at the time
29 of passage of this act; for the year beginning October 1, 2017, the reimbursement for direct-care
30 costs under this provision will be phased out in twenty-five-percent (25%) increments each year
31 until October 1, 2021, when the reimbursement will no longer be in effect; and
32 (2) No facility shall lose or gain more than five dollars ($5.00) in its total, per diem rate the
33 first year of the transition. An adjustment to the per diem loss or gain may be phased out by twenty-
34 five percent (25%) each year; except, however, for the years beginning October 1, 2015, there shall
LC001571 - Page 33 of 93

1 be no adjustment to the per diem gain or loss, but the phase out shall resume thereafter; and
2 (3) The transition plan and/or period may be modified upon full implementation of facility
3 per diem rate increases for quality of care-related measures. Said modifications shall be submitted
4 in a report to the general assembly at least six (6) months prior to implementation.
5 (4) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, for the twelve-month (12) period beginning
6 July 1, 2015, Medicaid payment rates for nursing facilities established pursuant to this section shall
7 not exceed ninety-eight percent (98%) of the rates in effect on April 1, 2015. Consistent with the
8 other provisions of this chapter, nothing in this provision shall require the executive office to restore
9 the rates to those in effect on April 1, 2015, at the end of this twelve-month (12) period.
10 (5) Commencing July 1, 2025, and for each subsequent year, the executive office of health
11 and human services is hereby authorized and directed to amend its regulations for reimbursement
12 to nursing facilities in order that each nursing facility shall be paid the Medicare equivalent rate.
13 The provisions of subsection (a)(3)(iii) shall apply.
14 40-8-26. Community health centers.
15 (a) For the purposes of this section, the term community health centers refers to federally
16 qualified health centers and rural health centers.
17 (b) To support the ability of community health centers to provide high-quality medical care
18 to patients, the executive office of health and human services (“executive office”) may adopt and
19 implement an alternative payment methodology (APM) for determining a Medicaid per-visit
20 reimbursement for community health centers that is compliant with the prospective payment system
21 (PPS) provided for in the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection
22 Act of 2000. The following principles are to ensure that the APM PPS rate determination
23 methodology is part of the executive office overall value purchasing approach. For community
24 health centers that do not agree to the principles of reimbursement that reflect the APM PPS,
25 EOHHS shall reimburse such community health centers at the federal PPS rate, as required per
26 section 1902(bb)(3) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(bb)(3). For community health
27 centers that are reimbursed at the federal PPS rate, subsections (d) through (f) of this section apply.
28 (c) The APM PPS rate determination methodology will (i) Fairly recognize the reasonable
29 costs of providing services. Recognized reasonable costs will be those appropriate for the
30 organization, management, and direct provision of services and (ii) Provide assurances to the
31 executive office that services are provided in an effective and efficient manner, consistent with
32 industry standards. Except for demonstrated cause and at the discretion of the executive office, the
33 maximum reimbursement rate for a service (e.g., medical, dental) provided by an individual
34 community health center shall not exceed one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the median
LC001571 - Page 34 of 93

1 rate for all community health centers within Rhode Island. not only bill the community health center
2 on a fee-for-service basis at the Medicare equivalent rate but also make a series of quality incentive
3 payments if the community health center meets certain quality incentives. Quality incentive
4 payments shall be set at a percentage of the aggregate monthly billing. The quality incentive
5 payments shall be as follows:
6 (1) Ten percent (10%) for meeting benchmarks set by the Medicaid director for screening
7 patients for Medicaid eligibility.
8 (2) Five percent (5%) for meeting benchmarks set by the Medicaid director for enrolling
9 patients who regularly smoke tobacco in smoking cessation programs.
10 (3) Ten percent (10%) for meeting benchmarks set by the director of human services for
11 screening patients for supplemental nutrition assistance program eligibility.
12 (4) Ten percent (10%) for ensuring that no more than one percent (1%) of patients are ever
13 not offered an appointment within a month if they request one.
14 (5) Up to fifteen percent (15%) for meeting benchmarks set by the Medicaid director for
15 the improvement of air quality in patients' homes through directly funding interventions such as:
16 air quality inspections, the installation of air filters, the installation of ventilation, and the
17 replacement of gas stoves with electric stoves.
18 (6) Up to fifteen percent (15%) for meeting benchmarks set by the Medicaid director for
19 the removal or mitigation of environmental toxins in patients' homes through the direct funding of
20 removal or mitigation of environmental toxins. These toxins shall include, but shall not be limited
21 to, lead, radon, asbestos, and carbon monoxide.
22 (d) Community health centers will cooperate fully and timely with reporting requirements
23 established by the executive office.
24 (e) Reimbursement rates established through this methodology shall be incorporated into
25 the PPS reconciliation for services provided to Medicaid-eligible persons who are enrolled in a
26 health plan on the date of service. Monthly payments by the executive office related to PPS for
27 persons enrolled in a health plan shall be made directly to the community health centers.
28 (f) Reimbursement rates established through this the APM methodology shall not be
29 incorporated into the actuarially certified capitation rates paid to a health plan. The health plan shall
30 be responsible for paying the full amount of the reimbursement rate to the community health center
31 for each service eligible for reimbursement under the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits
32 Improvement and Protection Act of 2000. If the health plan has an alternative payment arrangement
33 with the community health center opts to utilize the APM methodology, the health plan may
34 establish a PPS reconciliation process for eligible services and make monthly payments related to
LC001571 - Page 35 of 93

1 PPS for persons enrolled in the health plan on the date of service shall bear the full upside and
2 downside risk of decreased or increased costs from the APM methodology. The executive office
3 will review, at least annually, the Medicaid reimbursement rates and reconciliation methodology
4 used by the health plans for community health centers to ensure payments to each are made in
5 compliance with the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of
6 2000.
7 40-8-32. Support for certain patients of nursing facilities.

14 or is a fiduciary as defined below.
15 (3) “Costs of care” shall mean the costs of providing care to a patient of a nursing facility,
16 including nursing care, personal care, meals, transportation, and any other costs, charges, and
17 expenses incurred by a nursing facility in providing care to a patient. Costs of care shall not exceed
18 the customary rate the nursing facility charges to a patient who pays for his or her care directly
19 rather than through a governmental or other third-party payor.
20 (4) “Fiduciary” shall mean a person to whom power or property has been formally
21 entrusted for the benefit of another, such as an attorney-in-fact, legal guardian, trustee, or
22 representative payee.
23 (5) “Nursing facility” shall mean a nursing facility licensed under chapter 17 of title 23,
24 that is a participating provider in the Rhode Island Medicaid program.

26 U.S.C. § 1396p(c), as amended from time to time, on a person whose assets have been transferred
27 for less than fair market value.
28 (7) “Uncompensated care” — Care and services provided by a nursing facility to a
29 Medicaid applicant without receiving compensation therefore from Medicaid, Medicare, the
30 Medicaid applicant, or other source. The acceptance of any payment representing actual or
31 estimated applied income shall not disqualify the care and services provided from qualifying as
32 uncompensated care.
33 (b) Penalty period resulting from transfer. Any transfer or assignment of assets resulting in
34 the establishment or imposition of a penalty period shall create a debt that shall be due and owing
LC001571 - Page 36 of 93

1 to a nursing facility for the unpaid costs of care provided during the penalty period to a patient of
2 that facility who has been subject to the penalty period. The amount of the debt established shall
3 not exceed the fair market value of the transferred assets at the time of transfer that are the subject
4 of the penalty period. A nursing facility may bring an action to collect a debt for the unpaid costs
5 of care given to a patient who has been subject to a penalty period, against either the transferor or
6 the transferee, or both. The provisions of this section shall not affect other rights or remedies of the
7 parties.
8 (c) Applied income. A nursing facility may provide written notice to a patient who is a
9 Medicaid recipient and any authorized individual of that patient:
10 (1) Of the amount of applied income due;
11 (2) Of the recipient’s legal obligation to pay the applied income to the nursing facility; and
12 (3) That the recipient’s failure to pay applied income due to a nursing facility not later than
13 thirty (30) days after receiving notice from the nursing facility may result in a court action to
14 recover the amount of applied income due.
15 A nursing facility that is owed applied income may, in addition to any other remedies
16 authorized under law, bring a claim to recover the applied income against a patient and any
17 authorized individual. If a court of competent jurisdiction determines, based upon clear and
18 convincing evidence, that a defendant willfully failed to pay or withheld applied income due and
19 owing to a nursing facility for more than thirty (30) days after receiving notice pursuant to
20 subsection (c), the court may award the amount of the debt owed, court costs, and reasonable
21 attorney’s fees to the nursing facility.
22 (d) Effects. Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit or otherwise diminish any other
23 causes of action possessed by any such nursing facility. The death of the person receiving nursing
24 facility care shall not nullify or otherwise affect the liability of the person or persons charged with
25 the costs of care rendered or the applied income amount as referenced in this section.
26 SECTION 8. Sections 40-8-3.1, 40-8-9.1, 40-8-13.5, 40-8-15, 40-8-19.2 and 40-8-27 of

29 When an applicant or recipient of Medicaid owns a life estate in property that is his or her
30 principal place of residence with the reserved power and authority, during his or her lifetime, to
31 sell, convey, mortgage, or otherwise dispose of the real property without the consent or joinder by
32 the holder(s) of the remainder interest, the principal place of residence shall not be regarded as an
33 excluded resource for the purpose of Medicaid eligibility, unless the applicant or recipient
34 individually, or through his or her guardian, conservator, or attorney in fact, conveys all outstanding
LC001571 - Page 37 of 93

1 remainder interest to him or herself.
2 An applicant or recipient who, by a deed created, executed and recorded on or before June
3 30, 2014, has reserved a life estate in property that is his or her principal place of residence with
4 the reserved power and authority, during his or her lifetime, to sell, convey, mortgage, or otherwise
5 dispose of the real property without the consent or joinder by the holder(s) of the remainder interest,
6 shall not be ineligible for Medicaid on the basis of the deed, regardless of whether the transferee of
7 the remainder interest is a person or persons, trust, or entity.
8 40-8-9.1. Notice.
9 Whenever an individual who is receiving medical assistance under this chapter transfers
10 an interest in real or personal property, the individual shall notify the executive office of health and
11 human services within ten (10) days of the transfer. The notice shall be sent to the individual’s local
12 office and the legal office of the executive office of health and human services and include, at a
13 minimum, the individual’s name, social security number or, if different, the executive office of
14 health and human services identification number, the date of transfer, and the dollar value, if any,
15 paid or received by the individual who received benefits under this chapter. In the event an
16 individual fails to provide notice required by this section to the executive office of health and human
17 services and in the event an individual has received medical assistance, any individual and/or entity,
18 who knew or should have known that the individual failed to provide the notice and who receives
19 any distribution of value as a result of the transfer, shall be liable to the executive office of health
20 and human services to the extent of the value of the transfer. Moreover, any such individual shall
21 be subject to the provisions of § 40-6-15 and any remedy provided by applicable state and federal
22 laws and rules and regulations. Failure to comply with the notice requirements set forth in the
23 section shall not affect the marketability of title to real estate transferred while the transferor is
24 receiving medical assistance.
25 40-8-13.5. Hospital Incentive Program (HIP).
26 The secretary of the executive office of health and human services is authorized to seek the
27 federal authorities required to implement a hospital incentive program (HIP). The HIP shall provide
28 the participating licensed hospitals the ability to obtain certain payments for achieving performance
29 goals established by the secretary. HIP payments shall commence no earlier than July 1, 2016.

31 (a)(1) Upon the death of a recipient of Medicaid under Title XIX of the federal Social
32 Security Act (42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq. and referred to hereinafter as the “Act”), the total sum for
33 Medicaid benefits so paid on behalf of a beneficiary who was fifty-five (55) years of age or older
34 at the time of receipt shall be and constitute a lien upon the estate, as defined in subsection (a)(2),
LC001571 - Page 38 of 93

1 of the beneficiary in favor of the executive office of health and human services (“executive office”).
2 The lien shall not be effective and shall not attach as against the estate of a beneficiary who is
3 survived by a spouse, or a child who is under the age of twenty-one (21), or a child who is blind or
4 permanently and totally disabled as defined in Title XVI of the federal Social Security Act, 42
5 U.S.C. § 1381 et seq. The lien shall attach against property of a beneficiary, which is included or
6 includable in the decedent’s probate estate, regardless of whether or not a probate proceeding has
7 been commenced in the probate court by the executive office or by any other party. Provided,
8 however, that such lien shall only attach and shall only be effective against the beneficiary’s real
9 property included or includable in the beneficiary’s probate estate if such lien is recorded in the
10 land evidence records and is in accordance with subsection (e). Decedents who have received
11 Medicaid benefits are subject to the assignment and subrogation provisions of §§ 40-6-9 and 40-6-

19 beneficiary of Medicaid benefits who was fifty-five (55) years of age or older at the date of death,
20 and to provide a statement identifying the decedent’s property and the names and addresses of all
21 persons entitled to take any share or interest of the estate as legatees or distributees thereof.

26 of lien.
27 (e) Provided, however, that no lien created under this section shall attach nor become

30 claim, and describing the real property by a description containing all of the following: (1) Tax
31 assessor’s plat and lot; and (2) Street address. The statement of claim shall be recorded in the

1 for Medicaid benefits.
2 (f) The executive office shall establish procedures, in accordance with the standards
3 specified by the Secretary, United States Department of Health and Human Services, under which
4 the executive office shall waive, in whole or in part, the lien and reimbursement established by this

3 40-8-19.2. Nursing Facility Incentive Program (NFIP).
4 The secretary of the executive office of health and human services is authorized to seek the
5 federal authority required to implement a nursing facility incentive program (NFIP). The NFIP
6 shall provide the participating licensed nursing facilities the ability to obtain certain payments for
7 achieving performance goals established by the secretary. NFIP payments shall commence no
8 earlier than July 1, 2016.
9 40-8-27. Cooperation by providers.
10 Medicaid providers who employ individuals applying for benefits under any chapter of this

14 12. Documents requested by the department may include, but are not limited to, certificates of
15 coverage or a summary of benefits and employee obligations. Upon receiving notification that the
16 department has determined that the employee is eligible for premium assistance under § 40-8.4-12,
17 the provider shall accept the enrollment of the employee and his or her family in the employer-
18 based health insurance plan without regard to any seasonal enrollment restrictions, including open-
19 enrollment restrictions, and/or the impact on the employee’s wages. Additionally, the Medicaid
20 provider employing such persons shall not offer “pay in lieu of benefits.” Providers who do not
21 comply with the provisions set forth in this section shall be subject to suspension as a participating
22 Medicaid provider.
23 SECTION 9. Sections 40-8.4-4, 40-8.4-5, 40-8.4-10, 40-8.4-12, 40-8.4-15 and 40-8.4-19
24 of the General Laws in Chapter 40-8.4 entitled "Health Care for Families" are hereby amended to
25 read as follows:
26 40-8.4-4. Eligibility.
27 (a) Medical assistance for families. There is hereby established a category of medical
28 assistance eligibility pursuant to § 1931 of Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396u-
29 1, for families whose income and resources are no greater than the standards in effect in the aid to
30 families with dependent children program on July 16, 1996, or such increased standards as the
31 department may determine. The executive office of health and human services is directed to amend
32 the medical assistance Title XIX state plan and to submit to the United States Department of Health
33 and Human Services an amendment to the RIte Care waiver project to provide for medical
34 assistance coverage to families under this chapter in the same amount, scope, and duration as
LC001571 - Page 41 of 93

1 coverage provided to comparable groups under the waiver. The department is further authorized
2 and directed to submit amendments and/or requests for waivers to the Title XXI state plan as may
3 be necessary to maximize federal contribution for provision of medical assistance coverage
4 provided pursuant to this chapter, including providing medical coverage as a “qualified state” in
5 accordance with Title XXI of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1397aa et seq. Implementation
6 of expanded coverage under this chapter shall not be delayed pending federal review of any Title
7 XXI amendment or waiver.
8 (b) Income. The secretary of the executive office of health and human services is authorized
9 and directed to amend the medical assistance Title XIX state plan or RIte Care waiver to provide
10 medical assistance coverage through expanded income disregards or other methodology for parents
11 or relative caretakers whose income levels are below one hundred thirty-three percent (133%) of
12 the federal poverty level.
13 (c) Healthcare coverage provided under this section shall also be provided without regard
14 to availability of federal financial participation to a noncitizen family member who is a resident of
15 Rhode Island, and who is otherwise eligible for such assistance. The department is further
16 authorized to promulgate any regulations necessary, and in accord with title XIX [42 U.S.C. § 1396
17 et seq.] and title XXI [42 U.S.C. § 1397 et seq.] of the Social Security Act as necessary in order to
18 implement the state plan amendment. The executive office of health and human services is directed
19 to ensure that federal financial participation is assessed to the maximum extent allowable to provide
20 coverage pursuant to this section, at least every two (2) years, and that state-only funds will be used
21 only if federal financial participation is not available.
22 40-8.4-5. Managed care.
23 The delivery and financing of the healthcare services provided under this chapter shall may
24 be provided through a system of managed care. A managed care system integrates an efficient
25 financing mechanism with quality service delivery; provides a “medical home” to ensure
26 appropriate care and deter unnecessary and inappropriate care; and places emphasis on preventive
27 and primary health care. Beginning July 1, 2029, all payments shall be provided directly by the
28 state without an intermediate payment to a managed care entity or other form of health insurance
29 company, unless it is owned by the state. Beginning July 1, 2025, no new contracts may be entered
30 into between the Medicaid office and an intermediate payor such as a managed care entity or other
31 form of health insurance company for the payment of healthcare services pursuant to this chapter,
32 unless it is owned by the state.
33 40-8.4-10. Regulations.
34 (a) The department of human services Medicaid director is authorized to promulgate any
LC001571 - Page 42 of 93

1 regulations necessary to implement this chapter.
2 (b) When promulgating any rule or regulation necessary to implement this chapter, or any
3 rule or regulation related to RIte Care, the department Medicaid director shall send the notice
4 referred to in § 42-35-3 and a true copy of the rule referred to in § 42-35-4 of the Rhode Island
5 administrative procedures act to each of the co-chairpersons of the permanent joint committee on
6 health care oversight established by § 40-8.4-14.
7 40-8.4-12. RIte Share health insurance premium assistance program.
8 (a) Basic RIte Share health insurance premium assistance program. Under the terms
9 of Section 1906 of Title XIX of the U.S. Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396e, states are permitted
10 to pay a Medicaid-eligible person’s share of the costs for enrolling in employer-sponsored health
11 insurance (ESI) coverage if it is cost-effective to do so. Pursuant to the general assembly’s direction
12 in the Rhode Island health reform act of 2000, the Medicaid agency requested and obtained federal
13 approval under § 1916, 42 U.S.C. § 1396o, to establish the RIte Share premium assistance program
14 to subsidize the costs of enrolling Medicaid-eligible persons and families in employer-sponsored
15 health insurance plans that have been approved as meeting certain cost and coverage requirements.
16 The Medicaid agency also obtained, at the general assembly’s direction, federal authority to require
17 any such persons with access to ESI coverage to enroll as a condition of retaining eligibility
18 providing that doing so meets the criteria established in Title XIX for obtaining federal matching
19 funds.
20 (b) Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
21 (1) “Cost-effective” means that the portion of the ESI that the state would subsidize, as
22 well as wrap-around costs, would on average cost less to the state than enrolling that same
23 person/family in a managed-care delivery system.
24 (2) “Cost sharing” means any co-payments, deductibles, or co-insurance associated with
25 ESI.
26 (3) “Employee premium” means the monthly premium share a person or family is required
27 to pay to the employer to obtain and maintain ESI coverage.
28 (4) “Employer-sponsored insurance” or “ESI” means health insurance or a group health
29 plan offered to employees by an employer. This includes plans purchased by small employers
30 through the state health insurance marketplace, healthsource, RI (HSRI).
31 (5) “Policy holder” means the person in the household with access to ESI, typically the
32 employee.
33 (6) “RIte Share-approved employer-sponsored insurance (ESI)” means an employer-
34 sponsored health insurance plan that meets the coverage and cost-effectiveness criteria for RIte
LC001571 - Page 43 of 93

1 Share.
2 (7) “RIte Share buy-in” means the monthly amount an Medicaid-ineligible policy holder
3 must pay toward RIte Share-approved ESI that covers the Medicaid-eligible children, young adults,
4 or spouses with access to the ESI. The buy-in only applies in instances when household income is
5 above one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the FPL.
6 (8) “RIte Share premium assistance program” means the Rhode Island Medicaid premium
7 assistance program in which the State pays the eligible Medicaid member’s share of the cost of
8 enrolling in a RIte Share-approved ESI plan. This allows the state to share the cost of the health
9 insurance coverage with the employer.
10 (9) “RIte Share unit” means the entity within the executive office of health and human
11 services (EOHHS) responsible for assessing the cost-effectiveness of ESI, contacting employers
12 about ESI as appropriate, initiating the RIte Share enrollment and disenrollment process, handling
13 member communications, and managing the overall operations of the RIte Share program.
14 (10) “Third-party liability (TPL)” means other health insurance coverage. This insurance
15 is in addition to Medicaid and is usually provided through an employer. Since Medicaid is always
16 the payer of last resort, the TPL is always the primary coverage.
17 (11) “Wrap-around services or coverage” means any healthcare services not included in
18 the ESI plan that would have been covered had the Medicaid member been enrolled in a RIte Care
19 or Rhody Health Partners plan. Coverage of deductibles and co-insurance is included in the wrap.
20 Co-payments to providers are not covered as part of the wrap-around coverage.
21 (c) RIte Share populations. Medicaid beneficiaries subject to eligible for RIte Share
22 include: children, families, parent and caretakers eligible for Medicaid or the children’s health
23 insurance program (CHIP) under this chapter or chapter 12.3 of title 42; and adults between the
24 ages of nineteen (19) and sixty-four (64) who are eligible under chapter 8.12 of this title, not
25 receiving or eligible to receive Medicare, and are enrolled in managed care delivery systems. The
26 following conditions apply:
27 (1) The income of Medicaid beneficiaries shall affect whether and in what manner they
28 must may participate in RIte Share as follows:
29 (i) Income at or below one hundred fifty percent (150%) of FPL — Persons and families
30 determined to have household income at or below one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the federal
31 poverty level (FPL) guidelines based on the modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) standard or
32 other standard approved by the secretary are required to participate in RIte Share if a Medicaid-
33 eligible adult or parent/caretaker has access to cost-effective ESI. Enrolling in ESI through RIte
34 Share shall be a condition of maintaining Medicaid health coverage for any eligible adult with
LC001571 - Page 44 of 93

1 access to such coverage.
2 (ii) Income above one hundred fifty percent (150%) of FPL and policy holder is not
3 Medicaid-eligible — Premium assistance is available when the household includes Medicaid-
4 eligible members, but the ESI policy holder (typically a parent/caretaker, or spouse) is not eligible
5 for Medicaid. Premium assistance for parents/caretakers and other household members who are not
6 Medicaid-eligible may be provided in circumstances when enrollment of the Medicaid-eligible
7 family members in the approved ESI plan is contingent upon enrollment of the ineligible policy
8 holder and the executive office of health and human services (executive office) determines, based
9 on a methodology adopted for such purposes, that it is cost-effective to provide premium assistance
10 for family or spousal coverage.
11 (d) RIte Share enrollment as not a condition of eligibility. RIte Share enrollment shall
12 be purely voluntary and shall never be a condition of eligibility for Medicaid. For Medicaid
13 beneficiaries over the age of nineteen (19), enrollment in RIte Share shall be a condition of
14 eligibility except as exempted below and by regulations promulgated by the executive office.
15 (1) Medicaid-eligible children and young adults up to age nineteen (19) shall not be
16 required to enroll in a parent/caretaker relative’s ESI as a condition of maintaining Medicaid
17 eligibility if the person with access to RIte Share-approved ESI does not enroll as required. These
18 Medicaid-eligible children and young adults shall remain eligible for Medicaid and shall be
19 enrolled in a RIte Care plan.
20 (2) There shall be a limited six-month (6) exemption from the mandatory enrollment
21 requirement for persons participating in the RI works program pursuant to chapter 5.2 of this title.
22 (e) Approval of health insurance plans for premium assistance. The executive office of
23 health and human services shall adopt regulations providing for the approval of employer-based
24 health insurance plans for premium assistance and shall approve employer-based health insurance
25 plans based on these regulations. In order for an employer-based health insurance plan to gain
26 approval, the executive office must determine that the benefits offered by the employer-based
27 health insurance plan are substantially similar in amount, scope, and duration to the benefits
28 provided to Medicaid-eligible persons enrolled in a Medicaid managed care plan, when the plan is
29 evaluated in conjunction with available supplemental benefits provided by the office. The office
30 shall obtain and make available to persons otherwise eligible for Medicaid identified in this section
31 as supplemental benefits those benefits not reasonably available under employer-based health
32 insurance plans that are required for Medicaid beneficiaries by state law or federal law or
33 regulation. Once it has been determined by the Medicaid agency that the ESI offered by a particular
34 employer is RIte Share-approved, all Medicaid members with access to that employer’s plan are
LC001571 - Page 45 of 93

1 required to participate in RIte Share. Failure to meet the mandatory enrollment requirement shall
2 result in the termination of the Medicaid eligibility of the policy holder and other Medicaid
3 members nineteen (19) or older in the household who could be covered under the ESI until the
4 policy holder complies with the RIte Share enrollment procedures established by the executive
5 office.
6 (f) Premium assistance. The executive office shall provide premium assistance by paying
7 all or a portion of the employee’s cost for covering the eligible person and/or his or her family
8 under such a RIte Share-approved ESI plan subject to the buy-in provisions in this section.
9 (g) Buy-in. Persons who can afford it shall share in the cost. — The executive office is
10 authorized and directed to apply for and obtain any necessary state plan and/or waiver amendments
11 from the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to
12 require that persons enrolled in a RIte Share-approved employer-based health plan who have
13 income equal to or greater than one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the FPL to buy-in to pay a
14 share of the costs based on the ability to pay, provided that the buy-in cost shall not exceed five
15 percent (5%) of the person’s annual income. The executive office shall implement the buy-in by
16 regulation, and shall consider co-payments, premium shares, or other reasonable means to do so.
17 (h) Maximization of federal contribution. The executive office of health and human
18 services is authorized and directed to apply for and obtain federal approvals and waivers necessary
19 to maximize the federal contribution for provision of medical assistance coverage under this
20 section, including the authorization to amend the Title XXI state plan and to obtain any waivers
21 necessary to reduce barriers to provide premium assistance to recipients as provided for in Title
22 XXI of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1397aa et seq.
23 (i) Implementation by regulation. The executive office of health and human services is
24 authorized and directed to adopt regulations to ensure the establishment and implementation of the
25 premium assistance program in accordance with the intent and purpose of this section, the
26 requirements of Title XIX, Title XXI, and any approved federal waivers.
27 (j) Outreach and reporting. The executive office of health and human services shall
28 develop a plan to identify Medicaid-eligible individuals who have access to employer-sponsored
29 insurance and increase the use of RIte Share benefits. Beginning October 1, 2019, the executive
30 office shall submit the plan to be included as part of the reporting requirements under § 35-17-1.
31 Starting January 1, 2020, the executive office of health and human services shall include the number
32 of Medicaid recipients with access to employer-sponsored insurance, the number of plans that did
33 not meet the cost-effectiveness criteria for RIte Share, and enrollment in the premium assistance
34 program as part of the reporting requirements under § 35-17-1.
LC001571 - Page 46 of 93

1 (k) Employer-sponsored insurance. The executive office of health and human services
2 shall dedicate staff and resources to reporting monthly as part of the requirements under § 35-17-1
3 which employer-sponsored insurance plans meet the cost-effectiveness criteria for RIte Share.
4 Information in the report shall be used for screening for Medicaid enrollment to encourage Rite
5 Share participation. By October 1, 2021, the report shall include any employers with 300 or more
6 employees. By January 1, 2022, the report shall include employers with 100 or more employees.
7 The January report shall also be provided to the chairperson of the house finance committee; the
8 chairperson of the senate finance committee; the house fiscal advisor; the senate fiscal advisor; and
9 the state budget officer.
10 40-8.4-15. Advisory commission on health care.
11 (a) There is hereby established an advisory commission to be known as the “advisory
12 commission on health care” to advise the director of the department of human services on all
13 matters relating to the RIte Care and RIte Share programs, and other matters concerning access for
14 all Rhode Islanders to quality health care in the most affordable, economical manner. The director

26 programs involving purchasers of health care, including employers, consumers, and the state, health
27 insurers, providers of health care, and healthcare facilities, and all matters related to the interaction
28 among these groups, including methods to achieve more effective and timely resolution of disputes,
29 better communication, speedier, more reliable and less-costly administrative processes, claims,
30 payments, and other reimbursement matters, and the application of new processes or technologies
31 to such issues.

8 (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of state law, the delivery and financing of the
9 healthcare services provided under this chapter shall be provided through a system of managed
10 care. “Managed care” is defined as systems that: integrate an efficient financing mechanism with
11 quality service delivery; provide a “medical home” to ensure appropriate care and deter
12 unnecessary services; and place emphasis on preventive and primary care.
13 (b) Enrollment in managed care health delivery systems is mandatory for individuals
14 eligible for medical assistance under this chapter. This includes children in substitute care, children
15 receiving medical assistance through an adoption subsidy, and children eligible for medical
16 assistance based on their disability. Beneficiaries with third-party medical coverage or insurance
17 may be exempt from mandatory managed care in accordance with rules and regulations
18 promulgated by the department of human services for such purposes.
19 (c) Individuals who can afford to contribute shall share in the cost. The department of
20 human services is authorized and directed to apply for and obtain any necessary waivers and/or

29 between the Medicaid office and an intermediate payor such as a managed care entity or other form
30 of health insurance company for the payment of healthcare services pursuant to this chapter. To
31 ensure that all medical assistance beneficiaries, including the elderly and all individuals with
32 disabilities, have access to quality and affordable health care, the executive office of health and
33 human services (“executive office”) is authorized to implement mandatory managed-care health
34 systems.
LC001571 - Page 49 of 93

1 (b) “Managed care” is defined as systems that: integrate an efficient financing mechanism
2 with quality service delivery; provide a “medical home” to ensure appropriate care and deter
3 unnecessary services; and place emphasis on preventive and primary care. For purposes of this
4 section, managed care systems may also be defined to include a primary care case-management
5 model, community health teams, and/or other such arrangements that meet standards established
6 by the executive office and serve the purposes of this section. Managed care systems may also
7 include services and supports that optimize the health and independence of beneficiaries who are
8 determined to need Medicaid-funded long-term care under chapter 8.10 of this title or to be at risk
9 for the care under applicable federal state plan or waiver authorities and the rules and regulations
10 promulgated by the executive office. Any Medicaid beneficiaries who have third-party medical
11 coverage or insurance may be provided such services through an entity certified by, or in a
12 contractual arrangement with, the executive office or, as deemed appropriate, exempt from
13 mandatory managed care in accordance with rules and regulations promulgated by the executive
14 office.
15 (c) In accordance with § 42-12.4-7, the executive office is authorized to obtain any approval
16 through waiver(s), category II or III changes, and/or state-plan amendments, from the Secretary of
17 the United States Department of Health and Human Services, that are necessary to implement
18 mandatory, managed healthcare delivery systems for all Medicaid beneficiaries. The waiver(s),
19 category II or III changes, and/or state-plan amendments shall include the authorization to extend
20 managed care to cover long-term-care services and supports. Authorization shall also include, as
21 deemed appropriate, exempting certain beneficiaries with third-party medical coverage or
22 insurance from mandatory managed care in accordance with rules and regulations promulgated by
23 the executive office.
24 (d)(b) To ensure the delivery of timely and appropriate services to persons who become
25 eligible for Medicaid by virtue of their eligibility for a United States Social Security Administration
26 program, the executive office is authorized to seek any and all data-sharing agreements or other
27 agreements with the Social Security Administration as may be necessary to receive timely and
28 accurate diagnostic data and clinical assessments. This information shall be used exclusively for
29 the purpose of service planning, and shall be held and exchanged in accordance with all applicable
30 state and federal medical record confidentiality laws and regulations.
31 SECTION 12. Sections 40-8.12-2 and 40-8.12-3 of the General Laws in Chapter 40-8.12
32 entitled "Health Care for Adults" are hereby amended to read as follows:
33 40-8.12-2. Eligibility.
34 (a) Medicaid coverage for nonpregnant adults without children. There is hereby
LC001571 - Page 50 of 93

1 established, effective January 1, 2014, a category of Medicaid eligibility pursuant to Title XIX of
2 the Social Security Act, as amended by the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA)
3 of 2010, 42 U.S.C. § 1396u-1, for adults ages nineteen (19) to sixty-four (64) who do not have
4 dependent children and do not qualify for Medicaid under Rhode Island general laws applying to
5 families with children and adults who are blind, aged, or living with a disability. The executive
6 office of health and human services is directed to make any amendments to the Medicaid state plan
7 and waiver authorities established under Title XIX necessary to implement this expansion in
8 eligibility and ensure the maximum federal contribution for health insurance coverage provided
9 pursuant to this chapter.
10 (b) Income. The secretary of the executive office of health and human services is authorized
11 and directed to amend the Medicaid Title XIX state plan and, as deemed necessary, any waiver
12 authority to effectuate this expansion of coverage to any Rhode Islander who qualifies for Medicaid
13 eligibility under this chapter with income at or below one hundred and thirty-three percent (133%)
14 of the federal poverty level, based on modified adjusted-gross income.
15 (c) Delivery system. The executive office of health and human services is authorized and
16 directed to apply for and obtain any waiver authorities necessary to provide persons eligible under
17 this chapter with managed, coordinated healthcare coverage consistent with the principles set forth
18 in chapter 12.4 of title 42, pertaining to a healthcare home. Beginning July 1, 2029, all payments
19 shall be provided directly by the state without an intermediate payment to a managed care entity or
20 other form of health insurance company. Beginning July 1, 2025, no new contracts may be entered
21 into between the Medicaid office and an intermediate payor such as a managed care entity or other
22 form of health insurance company for the payment of healthcare services pursuant to this chapter.
23 40-8.12-3. Premium assistance program.
24 (a) The executive office of health and human services is directed to amend its rules and
25 regulations to implement a premium assistance program for adults with dependent children,
26 enrolled in the state’s health-benefits exchange, whose annual income and resources meet the
27 guidelines established in § 40-8.4-4 in effect on December 1, 2013. The premium assistance will
28 pay one-half of the cost of a commercial plan that a parent may incur after subtracting the cost-
29 sharing requirement under § 40-8.4-4 as of December 31, 2013, and any applicable federal tax
30 credits available. The office is also directed to amend the 1115 waiver demonstration extension and
31 the medical assistance Title XIX state plan for this program if it is determined that it is eligible for
32 funding pursuant to Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq.
33 (b) The executive office of health and human services shall require any individual receiving
34 benefits under a state-funded, healthcare assistance program to apply for any health insurance for
LC001571 - Page 51 of 93

1 which he or she is eligible, including health insurance available through the health benefits
2 exchange. Nothing shall preclude the state from using funds appropriated for Affordable Care Act
3 transition expenses to reduce the impact on an individual who has been transitioned from a state
4 program to a health insurance plan available through the health benefits exchange. It shall not be
5 deemed cost-effective for the state if it would result in a loss of benefits or an increase in the cost
6 of healthcare services for the person above an amount deemed de minimus as determined by state
7 regulation.
8 SECTION 13. Chapter 40-8.13 of the General Laws entitled "Long-Term Managed Care
9 Arrangements" is hereby repealed in its entirety.
10 CHAPTER 40-8.13
11 Long-Term Managed Care Arrangements

13 For purposes of this section the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
14 (1) “Beneficiary” means an individual who is eligible for medical assistance under the
15 Rhode Island Medicaid state plan established in accordance with 42 U.S.C. § 1396, and includes

18 (2) “Duals demonstration project” means a demonstration project established pursuant to
19 the financial alignment demonstration established under section 2602 of the Patient Protection and

21 between Rhode Island, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), and
22 qualified health plans, and covering healthcare services provided to beneficiaries.
23 (3) “EOHHS” means the Rhode Island executive office of health and human services.
24 (4) “EOHHS level-of-care tool” refers to a set of criteria established by EOHHS and used
25 in January, 2014 to determine the long-term-care needs of a beneficiary as well as the appropriate
26 setting for delivery of that care.
27 (5) “Long-term-care services and supports” means a spectrum of services covered by the
28 Rhode Island Medicaid program and/or the Medicare program, that are required by individuals with
29 functional impairments and/or chronic illness, and includes skilled or custodial nursing facility
30 care, as well as various home- and community-based services.
31 (6) “Managed care organization” means any health plan, health-maintenance organization,
32 managed care plan, or other person or entity that enters into a contract with the state under which
33 it is granted the authority to arrange for the provision of, and/or payment for, long-term-care
34 supports and services to eligible beneficiaries under a managed long-term-care arrangement.
LC001571 - Page 52 of 93

1 (7) “Managed long-term-care arrangement” means any arrangement under which a
2 managed care organization is granted some or all of the responsibility for providing and/or paying
3 for long-term-care services and supports that would otherwise be provided or paid under the Rhode
4 Island Medicaid program. The term includes, but is not limited to, a duals demonstration project,
5 and/or phase I and phase II of the integrated care initiative established by the executive office of
6 health and human services.
7 (8) “Plan of care” means a care plan established by a nursing facility in accordance with
8 state and federal regulations and that identifies specific care and services provided to a beneficiary.
9 40-8.13-2. Beneficiary choice.
10 Any managed long-term-care arrangement shall offer beneficiaries the option to decline
11 participation and remain in traditional Medicaid and, if a duals demonstration project, traditional
12 Medicare. Beneficiaries must be provided with sufficient information to make an informed choice
13 regarding enrollment, including:
14 (1) Any changes in the beneficiary’s payment or other financial obligations with respect to
15 long-term-care services and supports as a result of enrollment;
16 (2) Any changes in the nature of the long-term-care services and supports available to the
17 beneficiary as a result of enrollment, including specific descriptions of new services that will be
18 available or existing services that will be curtailed or terminated;
19 (3) A contact person who can assist the beneficiary in making decisions about enrollment;
20 (4) Individualized information regarding whether the managed care organization’s network
21 includes the healthcare providers with whom beneficiaries have established provider relationships.
22 Directing beneficiaries to a website identifying the plan’s provider network shall not be sufficient
23 to satisfy this requirement; and
24 (5) The deadline by which the beneficiary must make a choice regarding enrollment, and
25 the length of time a beneficiary must remain enrolled in a managed care organization before being
26 permitted to change plans or opt out of the arrangement.
27 40-8.13-3. Ombudsman process.
28 EOHHS shall designate an ombudsperson to advocate for beneficiaries enrolled in a
29 managed long-term-care arrangement. The ombudsperson shall advocate for beneficiaries through
30 complaint and appeal processes and ensure that necessary healthcare services are provided. At the
31 time of enrollment, a managed care organization must inform enrollees of the availability of the
32 ombudsperson, including contact information.
33 40-8.13-4. Provider/plan liaison.
34 EOHHS shall designate an individual, not employed by or otherwise under contract with a
LC001571 - Page 53 of 93

1 participating managed care organization, who shall act as liaison between healthcare providers and
2 managed care organizations, for the purpose of facilitating communications and ensuring that issues
3 and concerns are promptly addressed.
4 40-8.13-5. Financial principles under managed care.
5 (a) To the extent that financial savings are a goal under any managed long-term-care
6 arrangement, it is the intent of the legislature to achieve savings through administrative efficiencies,
7 care coordination, improvements in care outcomes and in a way that encourages the highest quality
8 care for patients and maximizes value for the managed-care organization and the state. Therefore,
9 any managed long-term-care arrangement shall include a requirement that the managed care
10 organization reimburse providers for services in accordance with these principles. Notwithstanding
11 any law to the contrary, for the twelve-month (12) period beginning July 1, 2015, Medicaid
12 managed long-term-care payment rates to nursing facilities established pursuant to this section shall
13 not exceed ninety-eight percent (98.0%) of the rates in effect on April 1, 2015.
14 (1) For a duals demonstration project, the managed care organization:
15 (i) Shall not combine the rates of payment for post-acute skilled and rehabilitation care
16 provided by a nursing facility and long-term and chronic care provided by a nursing facility in order
17 to establish a single-payment rate for dual eligible beneficiaries requiring skilled nursing services;
18 (ii) Shall pay nursing facilities providing post-acute skilled and rehabilitation care or long-
19 term and chronic care rates that reflect the different level of services and intensity required to
20 provide these services; and
21 (iii) For purposes of determining the appropriate rate for the type of care identified in
22 subsection (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the managed care organization shall pay no less than the rates
23 that would be paid for that care under traditional Medicare and Rhode Island Medicaid for these
24 service types. The managed care organization shall not, however, be required to use the same
25 payment methodology.
26 The state shall not enter into any agreement with a managed care organization in connection
27 with a duals demonstration project unless that agreement conforms to this section, and any existing
28 such agreement shall be amended as necessary to conform to this subsection.
29 (2) For a managed long-term-care arrangement that is not a duals demonstration project,
30 the managed care organization shall reimburse providers in an amount not less than the amount that
31 would be paid for the same care by the executive office of health and human services under the
32 Medicaid program. The managed care organization shall not, however, be required to use the same
33 payment methodology as the executive office of health and human services.
34 (3) Notwithstanding any provisions of the general or public laws to the contrary, the
LC001571 - Page 54 of 93

1 protections of subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section may be waived by a nursing facility in
2 the event it elects to accept a payment model developed jointly by the managed care organization
3 and skilled nursing facilities, that is intended to promote quality of care and cost-effectiveness,
4 including, but not limited to, bundled-payment initiatives, value-based purchasing arrangements,
5 gainsharing, and similar models.
6 (b) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, for the twelve-month (12) period beginning
7 July 1, 2015, Medicaid managed long-term-care payment rates to nursing facilities established
8 pursuant to this section shall not exceed ninety-eight percent (98.0%) of the rates in effect on April
9 1, 2015.
10 40-8.13-6. Payment incentives.
11 In order to encourage quality improvement and promote appropriate utilization incentives
12 for providers in a managed long-term-care arrangement, a managed care organization may use
13 incentive or bonus payment programs that are in addition to the rates identified in § 40-8.13-5.
14 40-8.13-7. Willing provider.
15 A managed care organization must contract with and cover services furnished by any
16 nursing facility licensed under chapter 17 of title 23 and certified by CMS that provides Medicaid-
17 covered nursing facility services pursuant to a provider agreement with the state, provided that the
18 nursing facility is not disqualified under the managed care organization’s quality standards that are
19 applicable to all nursing facilities; and the nursing facility is willing to accept the reimbursement
20 rates described in § 40-8.13-5.
21 40-8.13-8. Level-of-care tool.
22 A managed long-term-care arrangement must require that all participating managed care
23 organizations use only the EOHHS level-of-care tool in determining coverage of long-term-care
24 supports and services for beneficiaries. EOHHS may amend the level-of-care tool provided that
25 any changes are established in consultation with beneficiaries and providers of Medicaid-covered
26 long-term-care supports and services, and are based upon reasonable medical evidence or
27 consensus, in consideration of the specific needs of Rhode Island beneficiaries. Notwithstanding
28 any other provisions herein, however, in the case of a duals demonstration project, a managed care
29 organization may use a different level-of-care tool for determining coverage of services that would
30 otherwise be covered by Medicare, since the criteria established by EOHHS are directed towards
31 Medicaid-covered services; provided, that the level-of-care tool is based on reasonable medical
32 evidence or consensus in consideration of the specific needs of Rhode Island beneficiaries.
33 40-8.13-9. Case management/plan of care.
34 No managed care organization acting under a managed long-term-care arrangement may
LC001571 - Page 55 of 93

1 require a provider to change a plan of care if the provider reasonably believes that such an action
2 would conflict with the provider’s responsibility to develop an appropriate care plan under state
3 and federal regulations.
4 40-8.13-10. Care transitions.
5 In the event that a beneficiary:
6 (1) Has been determined to meet level-of-care requirements for nursing facility coverage
7 as of the date of his or her enrollment in a managed care organization; or
8 (2) Has been determined to meet level of care requirements for nursing facility coverage
9 by a managed care organization after enrollment; and there is a change in condition whereby the
10 managed care organization determines that the beneficiary no longer meets such level-of-care
11 requirements, the nursing facility shall promptly arrange for an appropriate and safe discharge (with
12 the assistance of the managed care organization if the facility requests it), and the managed care
13 organization shall continue to pay for the beneficiary’s nursing facility care at the same rate until
14 the beneficiary is discharged.
15 40-8.13-11. Reporting requirements.
16 EOHHS shall report to the general assembly and shall make available to interested persons
17 a separate accounting of state expenditures for long-term-care supports and services under any
18 managed long-term-care arrangement, specifically and separately identifying expenditures for
19 home- and community-based services, assisted-living services, hospice services within nursing
20 facilities, hospice services outside of nursing facilities, and nursing facility services. Such reports
21 shall be made twice annually, six (6) months apart, beginning six (6) months following the
22 implementation of any managed long-term-care arrangement, and shall include a detailed report of
23 utilization of each service. In order to facilitate reporting, any managed long-term-care arrangement
24 shall include a requirement that a participating managed care organization make timely reports of
25 the data necessary to compile the reports.
26 SECTION 14. Sections 42-7.2-10, 42-7.2-16 and 42-7.2-16.1 of the General Laws in
27 Chapter 42-7.2 entitled "Office of Health and Human Services" are hereby amended to read as
28 follows:
29 42-7.2-10. Appropriations and disbursements.
30 (a) The general assembly shall annually appropriate such sums as it may deem necessary
31 for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this chapter. The state controller is hereby
32 authorized and directed to draw his or her orders upon the general treasurer for the payment of such
33 sum or sums, or so much thereof as may from time to time be required, upon receipt by him or her
34 of proper vouchers approved by the secretary of the executive office of health and human services,
LC001571 - Page 56 of 93

1 or his or her designee.
2 (b) The general assembly shall, through the utilization of federal Medicaid reimbursement
3 for administrative costs, and additional funds, appropriate such funds as may be necessary to hire
4 additional personnel for the Medicaid office as follows: one hundred (100) outreach social workers
5 to encourage, assist and expedite individuals applying for Medicaid benefits; one hundred (100)
6 new programmers in order to build digital infrastructure for the Medicaid office; thirty (30) new
7 social workers and ten (10) new programmers to help increase spend down program utilization and
8 feasibility and examine possible legal changes necessary to increase spend down program
9 eligibility; and fifty (50) additional personnel for building administrative capacity. The Medicaid
10 office shall be exempt from any limitations placed on the number of full-time equivalent personnel
11 employed by the executive office of health and human services.
12 (b)(c) For the purpose of recording federal financial participation associated with
13 qualifying healthcare workforce development activities at the state’s public institutions of higher
14 education, and pursuant to the Rhode Island designated state health programs (DSHP), as approved
15 by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMC) October 20, 2016, in the 11-W-00242/1
16 amendment to Rhode Island’s section 1115 Demonstration Waiver, there is hereby established a
17 restricted-receipt account entitled “Health System Transformation Project” in the general fund of
18 the state and included in the budget of the office of health and human services. Due to the COVID-
19 19 pandemic, the office of health and human services is forbidden from utilizing any funds within
20 the health system transformation project restricted receipts account for any imposition of downside
21 risk for providers. No payment models that impose downside risk or in any way deviate from fee-
22 for-service shall be utilized for the Medicaid program without explicit authorization by the general
23 assembly.
24 (c)(d) There are hereby created within the general fund of the state and housed within the
25 budget of the office of health and human services two restricted receipt accounts, respectively
26 entitled “HCBS Support-ARPA” and “HCBS Admin Support-ARPA”. Amounts deposited into
27 these accounts are equivalent to the general revenue savings generated by the enhanced federal
28 match received on eligible home and community-based services between April 1, 2021, and March
29 31, 2022, allowable under Section 9817 of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, Pub. L. No.
30 117-2. Funds deposited into the “HCBS Support-ARPA” account will be used to finance the state
31 share of newly eligible Medicaid expenditures by the office of health and human services and its
32 sister agencies, including the department of children, youth and families, the department of health,
33 and the department of behavioral healthcare, developmental disabilities and hospitals. Funds
34 deposited into the “HCBS Admin Support-ARPA” account will be used to finance the state share
LC001571 - Page 57 of 93

1 of allowable administrative expenditures attendant to the implementation of these newly eligible
2 Medicaid expenditures. The accounts created under this subsection shall be exempt from the
3 indirect cost recovery provisions of § 35-4-27.
4 (d)(e) There is hereby created within the general fund of the state and housed within the
5 budget of the office of health and human services a restricted receipt account entitled “Rhode Island
6 Statewide Opioid Abatement Account” for the purpose of receiving and expending monies from
7 settlement agreements with opioid manufacturers, pharmaceutical distributors, pharmacies, or their
8 affiliates, as well as monies resulting from bankruptcy proceedings of the same entities. The
9 executive office of health and human services shall deposit any revenues from such sources that
10 are designated for opioid abatement purposes into the restricted receipt account. Funds from this
11 account shall only be used for forward-looking opioid abatement efforts as defined and limited by
12 any settlement agreements, state-city and town agreements, or court orders pertaining to the use of
13 such funds. By January 1 of each calendar year, the secretary of health and human services shall
14 report to the governor, the speaker of the house of representatives, the president of the senate, and
15 the attorney general on the expenditures that were funded using monies from the Rhode Island
16 statewide opioid abatement account and the amount of funds spent. The account created under this
17 subsection shall be exempt from the indirect cost recovery provisions of § 35-4-27. No
18 governmental entity has the authority to assert a claim against the entities with which the attorney
19 general has entered into settlement agreements concerning the manufacturing, marketing,
20 distributing, or selling of opioids that are the subject of the Rhode Island Memorandum of
21 Understanding Between the State and Cities and Towns Receiving Opioid Settlement Funds
22 executed by every city and town and the attorney general and wherein every city and town agreed
23 to release all such claims against these settling entities, and any amendment thereto. Governmental
24 entity means any state or local governmental entity or sub-entity and includes, but is not limited to,
25 school districts, fire districts, and any other such districts. The claims that shall not be asserted are
26 the released claims, as that term is defined in the settlement agreements executed by the attorney
27 general, or, if not defined therein, the claims sought to be released in such settlement agreements.
28 42-7.2-16. Medicaid System Reform 2008. Medicaid System Reform.
29 (a) The executive office of health and human services, in conjunction with the department
30 of human services, the department of children, youth and families, the department of health and the
31 department of behavioral healthcare, developmental disabilities and hospitals, is authorized to
32 design options that further the reforms in Medicaid initiated in 2008 Medicaid reform to ensure that
33 the program: transitions to a Medicare level of care as a first step in the transition to a state-level
34 Medicare for All system; phases out the use of intermediary privatized insurance companies such
LC001571 - Page 58 of 93

1 as managed care entities; transitions to the management of health insurers acquired due to
2 insolvency, smoothly integrating publicly owned health insurers with the Medicaid system; utilizes
3 payment models such as fee-for-service that incentivize higher quality of care and more utilization
4 of care; provides for the financial health of Rhode Island healthcare providers; encourages fair
5 wages and benefits for Rhode Island's healthcare workforce; develops and builds out the Medicaid
6 office's human capital, technological infrastructure, expertise, and general ability to manage
7 healthcare payments to prepare for the transition to a single-payer Medicare-for-All system; and
8 guides the transition of the Rhode Island healthcare funding system to a state-level Medicare-for-
9 All system. utilizes competitive and value based purchasing to maximize the available service
10 options, promotes accountability and transparency, and encourages and rewards healthy outcomes,
11 independence, and responsible choices; promotes efficiencies and the coordination of services
12 across all health and human services agencies; and ensures the state will have a fiscally sound
13 source of publicly-financed health care for Rhode Islanders in need.
14 (b) Principles and goals. In developing and implementing this system of reform, the
15 executive office of health and human services and the four (4) health and human services
16 departments shall pursue the following principles and goals:
17 (1) Empower consumers to make reasoned and cost-effective choices about their health by
18 providing them with the information and array of service options they need and offering rewards
19 for healthy decisions;
20 (2) Encourage personal responsibility by assuring the information available to beneficiaries
21 is easy to understand and accurate, provide that a fiscal intermediary is provided when necessary,
22 and adequate access to needed services;
23 (3) When appropriate, promote community-based care solutions by transitioning
24 beneficiaries from institutional settings back into the community and by providing the needed
25 assistance and supports to beneficiaries requiring long-term care or residential services who wish
26 to remain, or are better served in the community;
27 (4) Enable consumers to receive individualized health care that is outcome-oriented,
28 focused on prevention, disease management, recovery and maintaining independence;
29 (5) Promote competition between healthcare providers to ensure best value purchasing, to
30 leverage resources and to create opportunities for improving service quality and performance;
31 (6) Redesign purchasing and payment methods to assure fiscal accountability and
32 encourage and to reward service quality and cost-effectiveness by tying reimbursements to
33 evidence-based performance measures and standards, including those related to patient satisfaction
34 promote payment models such as fee-for-service that incentivize higher quality of care and phase
LC001571 - Page 59 of 93

1 out the use of payment models that shift risk to providers, such as capitation, episode-based
2 payments, global budgets, and similar models; and
3 (7) Continually improve technology to take advantage of recent innovations and advances
4 that help decision makers, consumers and providers to make informed and cost-effective decisions
5 regarding health care.
6 (c) The executive office of health and human services shall annually submit a report to the
7 governor and the general assembly describing the status of the administration and implementation
8 of the Medicaid Section 1115 demonstration waiver.
9 42-7.2-16.1. Reinventing Medicaid Act of 2015.
10 (a) Findings. The Rhode Island Medicaid program is an integral component of the state’s
11 healthcare system that provides crucial services and supports to many Rhode Islanders. As the
12 program’s reach has expanded, the costs of the program have continued to rise and the delivery of
13 care has become more fragmented and uncoordinated. Given the crucial role of the Medicaid
14 program to the state, it is of compelling importance that the state conduct a fundamental
15 restructuring of its Medicaid program that achieves measurable improvement in health outcomes
16 for the people and transforms the healthcare system to one that pays for the outcomes and quality
17 they deserve at a sustainable, predictable and affordable cost. The Reinventing Medicaid Act of
18 2015, as implemented in the budget for fiscal year two thousand sixteen (FY2016), involved drastic
19 cuts to the Medicaid program, along with policies that shifted risk to providers away from
20 intermediary insurers. Since the passage of that act, the finances of healthcare providers in Rhode
21 Island have deteriorated significantly, and it is therefore the duty of the general assembly to seek
22 corrective action to restore critical investments in the Medicaid system and redesign payment
23 models to remove risk from providers and concentrate risk in private insurance companies during

22 providing enhanced services to medical assistance recipients within existing appropriations.
23 42-12.3-7. Financial contributions.
24 The department of human services may not require the payment of enrollment fees, sliding

32 or dependent, whether or not coverage under such plan is elected.
33 (b) A premium may be charged for participation in the RIte Track or RIte Start programs
34 for eligible individuals whose family incomes are in excess of two hundred fifty percent (250%) of
LC001571 - Page 63 of 93

2 of the date of application for benefits under this chapter.
3 (c)(b) Every family who is eligible to participate in the RIte Track program, who has an
4 additional child who because of age is not eligible for RIte Track, or whose child becomes ineligible
5 for RIte Track because of his or her age, may be offered by the managed care provider with whom
6 the family is enrolled, the opportunity to enroll such ineligible child or children in the same
7 managed care program on a self-pay basis at the same cost, charge or premium as is being charged
8 to the state under the provisions of this chapter for other covered children within the managed care
9 program. The family may also purchase a package of enhanced services at the same cost or charge
10 to the department.

7 medical malpractice insurance joint underwriters association as defined in § 42-14.1-1, any
8 nonprofit dental service corporation as defined in § 27-20.1-2 and any nonprofit hospital or medical

10 44-17-6 and organizations defined in § 27-25-1, transacting business in this state, shall, on or before
11 April 15 in each year, file with the tax administrator, in the form that he or she may prescribe, a
12 return under oath or affirmation signed by a duly authorized officer or agent of the company,
13 containing information that may be deemed necessary for the determination of the tax imposed by
14 this chapter, and shall at the same time pay an annual tax to the tax administrator of two percent
15 (2%) three percent (3%) of the gross premiums on contracts of insurance and six percent (6%) of
16 all Medicaid payments received by an insurance company, except for ocean marine insurance as
17 referred to in § 44-17-6, covering property and risks within the state, written during the calendar
18 year ending December 31st next preceding.
19 (b) Qualifying insurers for purposes of this section means every domestic, foreign, or alien
20 insurance company, mutual association, organization, or other insurer and excludes:
21 (1) Health maintenance organizations, as defined in § 27-41-2;
22 (2) Nonprofit dental service corporations, as defined in § 27-20.1-2; and
23 (3) Nonprofit hospital or medical service corporations, as defined in §§ 27-19-1 and 27-
24 20-1.
25 (c) For tax years 2018 and thereafter, the rate of taxation may be reduced as set forth below
26 and, if so reduced, shall be fully applicable to qualifying insurers instead of the two percent (2%)
27 rate listed in subsection (a). In the case of foreign or alien companies, except as provided in § 27-
28 2-17(d), the tax shall not be less in amount than is imposed by the laws of the state or country under
29 which the companies are organized upon like companies incorporated in this state or upon its
30 agents, if doing business to the same extent in the state or country. The tax rate shall not be reduced
31 for gross premiums written on contracts of health insurance as defined in § 42-14-5(c) but shall

33 higher.
34 (d) For qualifying insurers, the premium tax rate may be decreased based upon Rhode
LC001571 - Page 76 of 93

1 Island jobs added by the industry as detailed below:
2 (1) A committee shall be established for the purpose of implementing tax rates using the
3 framework established herein. The committee shall be comprised of the following persons or their
4 designees: the secretary of commerce, the director of the department of business regulation, the
5 director of the department of revenue, and the director of the office of management and budget. No
6 rule may be issued pursuant to this section without the prior, unanimous approval of the committee;
7 (2) On the timetable listed below, the committee shall determine whether qualifying
8 insurers have added new qualifying jobs in this state in the preceding calendar year. A qualifying
9 job for purposes of this section is any employee with total annual wages equal to or greater than
10 forty percent (40%) of the average annual wages of the Rhode Island insurance industry, as
11 published by the annual employment and wages report of the Rhode Island department of labor and
12 training, in NAICS code 5241;
13 (3) If the committee determines that there has been a sufficient net increase in qualifying
14 jobs in the preceding calendar year(s) to offset a material reduction in the premium tax, it shall
15 calculate a reduced premium tax rate. Such rate shall be determined via a method selected by the
16 committee and designed such that the estimated personal income tax generated by the increase in
17 qualifying jobs is at least one hundred and twenty-five percent (125%) of the anticipated reduction
18 in premium tax receipts resulting from the new rate. For purposes of this calculation, the committee
19 may consider personal income tax withholdings or receipts, but in no event may the committee
20 include for the purposes of determining revenue neutrality income taxes that are subject to
21 segregation pursuant to § 44-48.3-8(f) or that are otherwise available to the general fund;
22 (4) Any reduced rate established pursuant to this section must be established in a
23 rulemaking proceeding pursuant to chapter 35 of title 42, subject to the following conditions:
24 (i) Any net increase in qualifying jobs and the resultant premium tax reduction and revenue
25 impact shall be determined in any rulemaking proceeding conducted under this section and shall
26 be set forth in a report included in the rulemaking record, which report shall also include a
27 description of the data sources and calculation methods used. The first such report shall also include
28 a calculation of the baseline level of employment of qualifying insurers for the calendar year 2015;
29 and
30 (ii) Notwithstanding any provision of the law to the contrary, no rule changing the tax rate
31 shall take effect until one hundred and twenty (120) days after notice of the rate change is provided
32 to the speaker of the house, the president of the senate, the house and senate fiscal advisors, and
33 the auditor general, which notice shall include the report required under the preceding provision.
34 (5) For each of the first three (3) rulemaking proceedings required under this section, the
LC001571 - Page 77 of 93

1 tax rate may remain unchanged or be decreased consistent with the requirements of this section,
2 but may not be increased. These first three (3) rulemaking proceedings shall be conducted by the
3 division of taxation and occur in the following manner:
4 (i) The first rulemaking proceeding shall take place in calendar year 2017. This proceeding
5 shall establish a rule that sets forth: (A) A new premium tax rate, if allowed under the requirements
6 of this section, which rate shall take effect in 2018, and (B) A method for calculating the number
7 of jobs at qualifying insurers;
8 (ii) The second rulemaking proceeding shall take place in calendar year 2018. This
9 proceeding shall establish a rule that sets forth: (A) A new premium tax rate, if allowed under the
10 requirements of this section, which rate shall take effect in 2019, and (B) The changes, if any, to
11 the method for calculating the number of jobs at qualifying insurers; and
12 (iii) The third rulemaking proceeding shall take place in calendar year 2019. This
13 proceeding shall establish a rule that sets forth: (A) A new premium tax rate, if allowed under the
14 requirements of this section, which rate shall take effect in 2020, and (B) The changes, if any, to
15 the method for calculating the number of jobs at qualifying insurers.
16 (6) The tax rate established in the regulation following regulatory proceedings that take
17 place in 2019 shall remain in effect through and including 2023. In calendar year 2023, the
18 department of business regulation will conduct a rulemaking proceeding and issue a rule that sets
19 forth: (A) A new premium tax rate, if allowed under the requirements of this section, which rate
20 shall take effect in 2024, and (B) The changes, if any, to the method for calculating the number of
21 jobs at qualifying insurers. A rule issued by the department of business regulation may decrease
22 the tax rate if the requirements for a rate reduction contained in this section are met, or it may
23 increase the tax rate to the extent necessary to achieve the overall revenue level sought when the
24 then-existing tax rate was established. Any rate established shall be no lower than one percent (1%)
25 and no higher than two percent (2%). This proceeding shall be repeated every three (3) calendar
26 years thereafter, however, the base for determination of job increases or decreases shall remain the
27 number of jobs existing during calendar year 2022;
28 (7) No reduction in the premium tax rate pursuant to this section shall be allowed absent a
29 determination that qualifying insurers have added in this state at least three hundred fifty (350)
30 new, full-time, qualifying jobs above the baseline level of employment of qualifying insurers for
31 the calendar year 2015;
32 (8) Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, the premium tax rate shall
33 never be set lower than one percent (1%);
34 (9) The division of taxation may adopt implementation guidelines, directives, criteria, rules
LC001571 - Page 78 of 93

1 and regulations pursuant to chapter 35 of title 42 as are necessary to implement this section; and
2 (10) The calculation of revenue impacts under this section is at the sole discretion of the
3 committee established under subsection (d)(1). Notwithstanding any provision of law to the
4 contrary, any administrative action or rule setting a tax rate pursuant to this section or failing or
5 declining to alter a tax rate pursuant to this section shall not be subject to judicial review under
6 chapter 35 of title 42.
7 (d) The department of revenue shall calculate the impacts of changes made to Medicaid
8 taking effect during or after fiscal year two thousand twenty-six (FY2026) on state funds, excluding
9 increased federal reimbursements, hereinafter the "Medicaid adjustment." Should the Medicaid
10 adjustment exceed the revenue impact of raising the gross premiums tax rate from two percent (2%)
11 to three percent (3%), hereinafter the "insurance premium tax rate adjustment revenue bonus," a
12 surtax shall be imposed on gross premiums written on contracts of health insurance as defined in §
13 42-14-5(c) at the rate that shall raise aggregate revenue equal to the Medicaid adjustment minus
14 the insurance premium tax rate adjustment revenue bonus.
15 SECTION 20. Section 44-51-3 of the General Laws in Chapter 44-51 entitled "Nursing

27 repeal or a restricted amendment of those provisions of the Medicaid Voluntary Contribution and
28 Provider-Specific Tax Amendments of 1991 (P.L. 102-234) that permit federal financial
29 participation to match state funds generated by taxes.
30 (d) If, after applying the applicable federal law and/or rules, regulations, or standards
31 relating to health care providers, the tax administrator determines that the assessment rate
32 established in subsection (b) of this section exceeds the maximum rate of assessment that federal
33 law will allow without reduction in federal financial participation, then the tax administrator is
34 directed to reduce the assessment to a rate equal to the maximum rate which the federal law will
LC001571 - Page 79 of 93

1 allow without reduction in federal participation. Provided, however, that the authority of the tax
2 administrator to lower the assessment rate established in subsection (b) of this section shall be
3 limited solely to such determination.
4 (e) In order that the tax administrator may properly carry out his/her responsibilities under
5 this section, the director of the department of human services shall notify the tax administrator of

10 law will allow without reduction in federal financial participation, then the tax administrator is
11 directed to reduce the assessment to a rate equal to the maximum rate which the federal law will
12 allow without reduction in federal participation. Provided, however, that the authority of the tax

28 bonds the proceeds of the refunding bonds, or proceeds from other sources, amounts that, when
29 invested in obligations of the United States or the State of Rhode Island, are sufficient to pay all
30 principal, interest, and premium, if any, on the capital development bonds until these bonds are
31 called for prepayment, then such capital development bonds shall not be considered debts of the
32 State of Rhode Island for any purpose starting from the date of deposit of such monies with the
33 paying agent. The refunding bonds shall continue to be a debt of the state until paid.

4 premiums and accrued interest and net the underwriters' cost, and cost of bond insurance, in one or
5 more of the depositories in which the funds of the state may be lawfully kept in special accounts
6 (hereinafter cumulatively referred to as "such capital development bond fund") appropriately
7 designated for each of the projects set forth in Section 1 hereof which shall have been approved by
8 the people to be used for the purpose of paying the cost of all such projects so approved.
9 All monies in the capital development bond fund shall be expended for the purposes
10 specified in the proposition provided for in Section 1 hereof under the direction and supervision of

28 procedures may also be required:

12 All health care payments system for Rhode Island. These waivers shall include the combining of
13 all federal health care funding streams into the system financing including, but not limited to,
14 Medicaid, Medicare, federal health care tax exemptions, and exchange subsides established
15 pursuant to the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. The Executive Office
16 plans to begin the transition process after the completion of the raising of the Medicaid system to
17 a Medicare standard of care and the associated stabilization of the Rhode Island health care
18 workforce and provider network; provided, however, that the Executive Office, understanding the
19 complexity of the proposed waiver application, reserves the right to begin the waiver negotiation
20 process before the transition of Medicaid to a Medicare standard is complete. The Executive Office
21 shall only proceed with the waiver and transition should waiver conditions be favorable to the state
22 as a whole, in the judgment of the Executive Office. In the event that a full waiver cannot be
23 complete, and health insurers have been acquired by the Medicaid Office due to insolvency and the
24 Medicaid Office's goal of payer system stabilization, the Executive Office is empowered to seek
25 limited waivers for the streamlining and integration of acquired health insurers with the Medicaid
26 system. The Executive Office shall submit the final approved waiver and transition plan to the

30 the recitals; and be it further;

EXPLANATION
BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL
OF
A N A C T
RELATING TO HEALTH AND SAFETY -- THE RHODE ISLAND COMPREHENSIVE
HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM
***
1 This act would establish a universal, comprehensive, affordable single-payer health care
2 insurance program and help control health care costs, which would be referred to as, "the Rhode
3 Island Comprehensive Health Insurance Program" (RICHIP). The program would be paid for by
4 consolidating government and private payments to multiple insurance carriers into a more
5 economical and efficient improved Medicare-for-all style single-payer program and substituting
6 lower progressive taxes for higher health insurance premiums, co-pays, deductibles and costs due
7 to caps. This program would save Rhode Islanders from the current overly expensive, inefficient
8 and unsustainable multi-payer health insurance system that unnecessarily prevents access to
9 medically necessary health care.
10 This act would take effect upon passage; however, the RICHIP program would not come
11 into operation until the necessary waivers are obtained, and the final financing proposal is approved
12 by the general assembly.
