1 SECTION 1. Section 27-18-57 of the General Laws in Chapter 27-18 entitled "Accident
2 and Sickness Insurance Policies" is hereby amended to read as follows:
3 27-18-57. F.D.A. approved prescription contraceptive drugs and devices.
4 (a) Every individual or group health insurance contract, plan, or policy issued pursuant to
5 this title that provides prescription coverage and is delivered, issued for delivery, or renewed,
6 amended, or effective in this state on or after January 1, 2026, shall provide coverage for F.D.A.
7 approved contraceptive drugs and devices requiring a prescription all of the following services and
8 contraceptive methods. Provided, that nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to mandate or
9 require coverage for the prescription drug RU 486.
10 (1) All FDA-approved contraceptive drugs, devices, and other products. The following
11 applies to this coverage:
12 (i) If there is a therapeutic equivalent of an FDA-approved contraceptive drug, device, or
13 product, the contract shall include either the original FDA-approved contraceptive drug, device, or
14 product or at least one of its therapeutic equivalents. "Therapeutic equivalent" shall have the same
15 definition as that set forth by the FDA;
16 (ii) If the covered therapeutic equivalent versions of a drug, device, or product are not
17 available, or are not tolerated by the patient, or are deemed medically inadvisable, a group or
18 blanket policy shall provide coverage for an alternate therapeutic equivalent version of the
19 contraceptive drug, device, or product, based on the determination of the healthcare provider,
1 without cost-sharing; and
2 (iii) A plan shall not require a prescription to trigger coverage of FDA-approved over-the-

4 over-the-counter contraceptives at in-network pharmacies without cost-sharing or medical
5 management restrictions;
6 (2) Voluntary sterilization procedures;
7 (3) Clinical services related to the provision or use of contraception, including

12 continued adherence, and device insertion and removal.
13 (b) A group or blanket policy subject to this section shall not impose a deductible,
14 coinsurance, copayment or any other cost-sharing requirement on the coverage provided pursuant
15 to this section. For a qualifying high-deductible health plan for a health savings account, the carrier
16 shall establish the plan's cost-sharing for the coverage provided pursuant to this section at the

19 impose utilization control or other forms of medical management limiting the supply of FDA-

21 location licensed or otherwise authorized to dispense drugs or supplies in an amount that is less
22 than a twelve (12) month supply, and shall not require an enrollee to make any formal request for
23 such coverage other than a pharmacy claim.
24 (c) Except as otherwise authorized under this section, a group or blanket policy shall not
25 impose any restrictions or delays on the coverage required under this section.

32 apply to contraceptive services or procedures provided for purposes other than contraception, such
33 as decreasing the risk of ovarian cancer or eliminating symptoms of menopause.
34 (c)(f) As used in this section, “religious employer” means an employer that is a “church or
LC002275 - Page 2 of 15

12 hundred sixty-five (365) days at a time that may be furnished or dispensed all at once or over the
13 course of the twelve (12) month period at the discretion of the prescriber.
14 (j) Nothing in this section shall be construed to exclude coverage for contraceptive drugs,
15 devices, or products for reasons other than contraceptive purposes, such as decreasing the risk of
16 ovarian cancer or eliminating symptoms of menopause, or for contraception that is necessary to
17 preserve the life or health of an enrollee. A plan that violates this section is subject to penalties, in
18 accordance with § 27-18-20. The department may base its determinations on findings from onsite
19 surveys, enrollee or other complaints, financial status, or any other source.

21 adopt rules and regulations for the implementation of this section, including the following:

15 to this section. For a qualifying high-deductible health plan for a health savings account, the carrier
16 shall establish the plan's cost-sharing for the coverage provided pursuant to this section at the
17 minimum level necessary to preserve the enrollee's ability to claim tax-exempt contributions and
18 withdrawals from their health savings account under 26 U.S.C. § 223. A health plan shall not
19 impose utilization control or other forms of medical management limiting the supply of FDA-
20 approved contraception that may be dispensed or furnished by a provider or pharmacist, or at a
21 location licensed or otherwise authorized to dispense drugs or supplies in an amount that is less
22 than a twelve (12) month supply, and shall not require an enrollee to make any formal request for
23 such coverage other than a pharmacy claim.
24 (c) Except as otherwise authorized under this section, a group or blanket policy shall not
25 impose any restrictions or delays on the coverage required under this section.
26 (d) Benefits for an enrollee under this section shall be the same for an enrollee's covered
27 spouse or domestic partner and covered non-spouse dependents.
28 (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, any health maintenance
29 corporation may issue to a religious employer an individual or group health insurance contract,
30 plan, or policy that excludes coverage for prescription contraceptive methods that are contrary to
31 the religious employer's bona fide religious tenets. The exclusion from coverage under this
32 subsection shall not apply to contraceptive services or procedures provided for purposes other than
33 contraception, such as decreasing the risk of ovarian cancer or eliminating symptoms of
34 menopause.
LC002275 - Page 12 of 15
1 (f) As used in this section, "religious employer" means an employer that is a "church or a
2 qualified church-controlled organization" as defined in 26 U.S.C. § 3121.
3 (g) Every religious employer that invokes the exemption provided under this section shall
4 provide written notice to prospective enrollees prior to enrollment with the plan, listing the
5 contraceptive healthcare services the employer refuses to cover for religious reasons.
6 (h) Beginning on the first day of each plan year after April 1, 2024, every health insurance
7 issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage that covers prescription contraception
8 shall not restrict reimbursement for dispensing a covered prescription contraceptive up to three
9 hundred sixty-five (365) days at a time that may be furnished or dispensed all at once or over the
10 course of the twelve (12) month period at the discretion of the prescriber.
11 (i) Nothing in this section shall be construed to exclude coverage for contraceptive drugs,
12 devices, or products for reasons other than contraceptive purposes, such as decreasing the risk of
13 ovarian cancer or eliminating symptoms of menopause, or for contraception that is necessary to
14 preserve the life or health of an enrollee. A plan that violates this section is subject to penalties, in
15 accordance with § 40-8-9. The department may base its determinations on findings from onsite
16 surveys, enrollee or other complaints, financial status, or any other source.
17 (j) The department shall monitor plan compliance in accordance with this section and shall
18 adopt and regulations rules for the implementation of this section, including the following:
19 (1) In addition to any requirements under state administrative procedures, the department
20 shall engage in a stakeholder process prior to the adoption of rules and regulations that include
21 healthcare service plans, pharmacy benefit plans, consumer representatives, including those
22 representing youth, low-income people, and communities of color, and other interested parties. The
23 department shall hold stakeholder meetings for stakeholders of different types to ensure sufficient
24 opportunity to consider factors and processes relevant to contraceptive coverage. The department
25 shall provide notice of stakeholder meetings on the department's website, and stakeholder meetings
26 shall be open to the public.
27 (2) The department shall conduct random reviews of each plan and its subcontractors to
28 ensure compliance with this section.
29 (3) The department shall submit an annual report to the general assembly and any other
30 appropriate entity with its findings from the random compliance reviews detailed in this section
31 and any other compliance or implementation efforts. This report shall be made available to the
32 public on the department’s website.

Introduced By: Representatives Alzate, Kazarian, Caldwell, Shanley, Speakman, Ajello,
Felix, Tanzi, Casimiro, and Giraldo
Date Introduced: March 07, 2025
Referred To: House Finance
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Section 27-18-57 of the General Laws in Chapter 27-18 entitled "Accident
2 and Sickness Insurance Policies" is hereby amended to read as follows:
3 27-18-57. F.D.A. approved prescription contraceptive drugs and devices.
4 (a) Every individual or group health insurance contract, plan, or policy issued pursuant to
5 this title that provides prescription coverage and is delivered, issued for delivery, or renewed,
6 amended, or effective in this state on or after January 1, 2026, shall provide coverage for F.D.A.
7 approved contraceptive drugs and devices requiring a prescription all of the following services and
8 contraceptive methods. Provided, that nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to mandate or
9 require coverage for the prescription drug RU 486.
10 (1) All FDA-approved contraceptive drugs, devices, and other products. The following
11 applies to this coverage:
12 (i) If there is a therapeutic equivalent of an FDA-approved contraceptive drug, device, or
13 product, the contract shall include either the original FDA-approved contraceptive drug, device, or
14 product or at least one of its therapeutic equivalents. "Therapeutic equivalent" shall have the same
15 definition as that set forth by the FDA;
16 (ii) If the covered therapeutic equivalent versions of a drug, device, or product are not
17 available, or are not tolerated by the patient, or are deemed medically inadvisable, a group or
18 blanket policy shall provide coverage for an alternate therapeutic equivalent version of the
19 contraceptive drug, device, or product, based on the determination of the healthcare provider,

1 without cost-sharing; and
2 (iii) A plan shall not require a prescription to trigger coverage of FDA-approved over-the-
3 counter contraceptive drugs, devices, and products, and shall provide point-of-sale coverage for
4 over-the-counter contraceptives at in-network pharmacies without cost-sharing or medical
5 management restrictions;
6 (2) Voluntary sterilization procedures;
7 (3) Clinical services related to the provision or use of contraception, including
8 consultations, examinations, procedures, device insertion, ultrasound, anesthesia, patient
9 education, referrals, and counseling; and
10 (4) Follow-up services related to the drugs, devices, products, and procedures covered
11 under this section, including, but not limited to, management of side effects, counseling for
12 continued adherence, and device insertion and removal.
13 (b) A group or blanket policy subject to this section shall not impose a deductible,
14 coinsurance, copayment or any other cost-sharing requirement on the coverage provided pursuant
15 to this section. For a qualifying high-deductible health plan for a health savings account, the carrier
16 shall establish the plan's cost-sharing for the coverage provided pursuant to this section at the
17 minimum level necessary to preserve the enrollee's ability to claim tax-exempt contributions and
18 withdrawals from their health savings account under 26 U.S.C. § 223. A health plan shall not
19 impose utilization control or other forms of medical management limiting the supply of FDA-
20 approved contraception that may be dispensed or furnished by a provider or pharmacist, or at a
21 location licensed or otherwise authorized to dispense drugs or supplies in an amount that is less
22 than a twelve (12) month supply, and shall not require an enrollee to make any formal request for
23 such coverage other than a pharmacy claim.
24 (c) Except as otherwise authorized under this section, a group or blanket policy shall not
25 impose any restrictions or delays on the coverage required under this section.
26 (d) Benefits for an enrollee under this section shall be the same for an enrollee's covered
27 spouse or domestic partner and covered non-spouse dependents
28 (b)(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, any insurance company may
29 issue to a religious employer an individual or group health insurance contract, plan, or policy that
30 excludes coverage for prescription contraceptive methods that are contrary to the religious
31 employer’s bona fide religious tenets. The exclusion from coverage under this subsection shall not
32 apply to contraceptive services or procedures provided for purposes other than contraception, such
33 as decreasing the risk of ovarian cancer or eliminating symptoms of menopause.
34 (c)(f) As used in this section, “religious employer” means an employer that is a “church or
LC002275 - Page 2 of 15

1 a qualified church-controlled organization” as defined in 26 U.S.C. § 3121.
2 (d)(g) This section does not apply to insurance coverage providing benefits for: (1) Hospital
3 confinement indemnity; (2) Disability income; (3) Accident only; (4) Long-term care; (5) Medicare
4 supplement; (6) Limited benefit health; (7) Specified disease indemnity; (8) Sickness or bodily
5 injury or death by accident or both; and (9) Other limited-benefit policies.
6 (e)(h) Every religious employer that invokes the exemption provided under this section
7 shall provide written notice to prospective enrollees prior to enrollment with the plan, listing the
8 contraceptive healthcare services the employer refuses to cover for religious reasons.
9 (f)(i) Beginning on the first day of each plan year after April 1, 2019, every health insurance
10 issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage that covers prescription contraception
11 shall not restrict reimbursement for dispensing a covered prescription contraceptive up to three
12 hundred sixty-five (365) days at a time that may be furnished or dispensed all at once or over the
13 course of the twelve (12) month period at the discretion of the prescriber.
14 (j) Nothing in this section shall be construed to exclude coverage for contraceptive drugs,
15 devices, or products for reasons other than contraceptive purposes, such as decreasing the risk of
16 ovarian cancer or eliminating symptoms of menopause, or for contraception that is necessary to
17 preserve the life or health of an enrollee. A plan that violates this section is subject to penalties, in
18 accordance with § 27-18-20. The department may base its determinations on findings from onsite
19 surveys, enrollee or other complaints, financial status, or any other source.
20 (k) The department shall monitor plan compliance in accordance with this section and shall
21 adopt rules and regulations for the implementation of this section, including the following:
22 (1) In addition to any requirements under state administrative procedures, the department
23 shall engage in a stakeholder process prior to the adoption of rules and regulations that include
24 healthcare service plans, pharmacy benefit plans, consumer representatives, including those
25 representing youth, low-income people, and communities of color, and other interested parties. The
26 department shall hold stakeholder meetings for stakeholders of different types to ensure sufficient
27 opportunity to consider factors and processes relevant to contraceptive coverage. The department
28 shall provide notice of stakeholder meetings on the department's website, and stakeholder meetings
29 shall be open to the public.
30 (2) The department shall conduct random reviews of each plan and its subcontractors to
31 ensure compliance with this section.
32 (3) The department shall submit an annual report to the general assembly and any other
33 appropriate entity with its findings from the random compliance reviews detailed in this section
