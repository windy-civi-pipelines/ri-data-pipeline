WEBER, BELOVED PSYCHIATRIC NURSE LEADER, HEALER, AND VETERAN OF THE
AIR FORCE AND U.S. ARMY RESERVES
Introduced By: Representatives Shekarchi, Blazejewski, Bennett, Chippendale,
Baginski, Finkelman, Casimiro, Solomon, Edwards, and Donovan
Date Introduced: January 23, 2025
Referred To: House read and passed
1 WHEREAS, It is with heavy hearts that we acknowledge the passing of Sylvia "Siggy"
2 Weber, who on September 7, 2024, at the age of 85, departed this life after courageously battling
3 an insidious illness. Sylvia was an extraordinary psychiatric nurse, healer, and dedicated veteran
4 who served her country with honor in the Air Force and U.S. Army Reserves. Her unwavering
5 commitment to helping others was evident throughout her remarkable life, and she leaves behind
6 a legacy of compassion, strength, and healing; and
7 WHEREAS, Born in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, Sylvia was the cherished daughter of the
8 late Harry and Ida (Zuckerman) Weber. Her family was central to her heart, and she leaves
9 behind her beloved older sister, Estelle (Weber) Beckerman, her sister-in-law Bernice Weber, her
10 devoted daughters Ilene (Weber) Schulenberger and her husband Ray, and Susan (Weber)
11 Tashian, whose tireless care, along with her son Zachary, surrounded Sylvia in love during her
12 final months. Sylvia adored her grandchildren Samantha, Genna, Zachary, and Jack, who brought
13 her immense joy and pride; and
14 WHEREAS, Sylvia's passion for nursing began early, and she pursued her education with
15 dedication, earning her Diploma in Nursing from Kings Point Hospital, a BSN from New York
16 University, and an MSN from UCLA. Her deep desire to heal and help led her to Rhode Island in
17 1972, where she made her home and continued her career, touching countless lives through her
18 fifty years of private practice in psychiatric counseling. She was a true beacon of hope to all who
19 sought her guidance; and
1 WHEREAS, Sylvia's influence extended far beyond her private practice. As the in-
2 service director at Butler Hospital and a guest lecturer at the University of Rhode Island and
3 Rhode Island College, she generously shared her knowledge and inspired future generations of
4 psychiatric nurses. Her colleagues and students will remember her not just for her wisdom, but
5 for her kindness and humanity; and
6 WHEREAS, A champion of environmental justice and social equality, Sylvia was a
7 fierce advocate who committed herself to causes that protected our planet and the rights of
8 individuals. She was deeply involved in the Rhode Island State Nurses Association, where she
9 served in numerous leadership roles, and she was instrumental in advancing environmental safety
10 in nursing practice. Her work was widely recognized, including her induction into the Rhode
11 Island State Nurses Association Hall of Fame in 2011; and
12 WHEREAS, Beyond her professional achievements, Sylvia was a healer in the truest
13 sense. As a longtime practitioner and teacher of Therapeutic Touch, she helped ease the suffering
14 of many through her hands and heart. Her healing gifts, combined with her unshakeable belief in
15 the sacred balance of the universe, left a profound impact on everyone she encountered. She was
16 a woman who "talked the talk and walked the walk," in both her professional life and her deeply
17 personal spiritual journey; and
18 WHEREAS, Sylvia lived a life full of love, kindness, and generosity. She was a
19 trailblazer, a woman of many firsts-becoming the first single woman in Rhode Island to be
20 granted a mortgage and to adopt children. She was a devoted friend to many, opening her home
21 and heart to those in need, and always offering support with no expectation of anything in return.
22 Her voice, whether cheering for the New England Patriots or championing her community, will
23 be dearly missed; now, therefore be it
24 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives extends its deepest sympathies to the
25 family of Sylvia "Siggy" Weber. Her life of selfless service, boundless compassion, and
26 unwavering dedication to healing and justice has left an indelible mark on our community and on
27 the many hearts she touched; and be it further
28 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
29 transmit duly certified copies of this resolution to Ilene Schulenberger, Susan Tashian, and Estelle
30 Beckerman.
