14 for administrative and minor applications, upon request of either the municipality or the applicant.
15 Pre-application meetings allow the applicant to meet with appropriate officials, boards and/or
16 commissions, planning staff, and, where appropriate, state agencies, for advice as to the required
17 steps in the approvals process, the pertinent local plans, ordinances, regulations, rules and
18 procedures and standards which may bear upon the proposed development project.
19 (b) At the pre-application stage the applicant may request the planning board or the
20 technical review committee for an informal concept plan review for a development. The purpose
21 of the concept plan review is also to provide planning board or technical review committee input
22 in the formative stages of major subdivision and land development concept design.
23 (c) Applicants seeking a pre-application meeting or an informal concept review shall
24 submit general, conceptual materials in advance of the meeting(s) as requested by municipal
25 officials.
26 (d) Pre-application meetings aim to encourage information sharing and discussion of
27 project concepts among the participants. Pre-application discussions are intended for the guidance
28 of the applicant and are not considered approval of a project or its elements.
29 (e) Provided that at least one pre-application meeting has been held for major land
30 development or subdivision application or sixty (60) days has elapsed from the filing of the pre-
31 application submission and no pre-application meeting has been scheduled to occur within those
32 sixty (60) days, nothing shall be deemed to preclude an applicant from thereafter filing and
33 proceeding with an application for a land development or subdivision project in accordance with §

1 45-23-36. General provisions — Authority and application for development and
2 certification of completeness.
3 (a) Authority. Municipalities shall provide for the submission and approval of land
4 development projects and subdivisions, as such terms are defined in the Rhode Island Zoning
5 Enabling Act of 1991, and/or this chapter, and such are subject to the local regulations which shall
6 be consistent with the requirements of this chapter. The local regulations must include all
7 requirements, procedures, and standards necessary for proper review and approval of applications
8 made under this chapter to ensure consistency with the intent and purposes of this chapter and with
9 § 45-24-47 of the Rhode Island Zoning Enabling Act of 1991.
10 (b) Classification. In accordance with this chapter, the administrative officer shall advise
11 the applicant as to which category of approval is required for a project. An applicant shall not be
12 required to obtain both land development and development plan review, for the same project. The
13 following categories of applications, as defined in this chapter, may be filed:
14 (1) Subdivisions. Administrative subdivision, minor subdivision, or major subdivision;
15 (2) Land development projects. Minor land development or major land development; and
16 (3) Development plan review.
17 (c) Certification of a complete application. An application shall initially be reviewed by
18 the administrative officer solely for the purpose to determine whether the application lacks
19 information required for the respective applications type as specified in the local checklist, and
20 whether the applicant lacks items or information which was required as a condition of a previous
21 approval stage(s) for the same project. An application shall be complete for purposes of
22 commencing the applicable time period for action when so certified by the administrative officer.
23 Every certification of completeness required by this chapter shall be in writing. In the event the
24 certification of the application is not made within the time specified in this chapter for the type of
25 plan, the application is deemed complete for purposes of commencing the review period unless the
26 application lacks information required for these applications as specified in the local regulations
27 and the administrative officer has notified the applicant, in writing, of the deficiencies in the
28 application. See §§ 45-23-38, 45-23-39, and 45-23-50 for applicable certification timeframes and
29 requirements. An application shall not be deemed incomplete for reasons other than the failure to
30 supply an item or items listed on the applicable checklist.
31 (d) Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, the planning board may subsequently
32 require correction of any information found to be in error and submission of additional information
33 specified in the regulations but not required by the administrative officer prior to certification, as
34 is necessary to make an informed decision.
LC002875/SUB A - Page 13 of 42

8 request of the applicant.
9 (7) Vesting.
10 (i) The approved master plan is vested for a period of two (2) years, with the right to extend

13 deny an application; a decision of the technical review committee where authorized to approve or
14 deny an application; or a decision of the planning board, to the superior court for the county in
15 which the municipality is situated by filing a complaint stating the reasons for the appeal within
16 twenty (20) days after the decision has been recorded and posted in the office of the city or town

19 and constituting the record of the case appealed from, or certified copies of the original documents,
20 together with any other facts that may be pertinent, with the clerk of the court within thirty (30)
21 days after being served with a copy of the complaint. When the complaint is filed by someone other
22 than the original applicant or appellant, the original applicant or appellant and the planning board
23 permitting authority shall be made parties to the proceedings. No responsive pleading is required

2 the court shall be made.
3 (d) The court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the planning board of appeal or
4 permitting authority as applicable as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact. The court
5 may affirm the decision of the board of appeal or permitting authority, as applicable or remand the
6 case for further proceedings, or may reverse or modify the decision if substantial rights of the
7 appellant have been prejudiced because of findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions that are:

8 the municipality, the setbacks, lot frontage, and lot width shall be reduced by the same proportion
9 that the area of such substandard lot meets the minimum lot area of the district in which the lot is
10 located. By way of example, if the lot area of a substandard lot only meets forty percent (40%) of
11 the minimum lot area required in the district in which it is located, the setbacks, lot frontage, and
12 lot width shall each be reduced to forty percent (40%) of the requirements for those dimensional
13 standards in the same district. However, to the extent the city or town has a zoning district in which
14 the lot would be conforming as to size, the city or town may require compliance with the building
15 setback, lot frontage, and lot width requirements for said zoning district if such requirement is in
16 the local zoning ordinance.
17 (2) Maximum lot building coverage for lots that are nonconforming in area shall be
18 increased by the inverse proportion that the area of such substandard lot meets the minimum area
19 requirements in the district in which the lot is located. By way of example, if the lot area of a
20 substandard lot only meets forty percent (40%) of the required minimum lot area, the maximum lot
21 building coverage is allowed to increase by sixty percent (60%) over the maximum permitted lot
22 building coverage in that district.
23 All proposals exceeding such reduced requirement shall proceed with a modification
24 request under § 45-24-46 or a dimensional variance request under § 45-24-41, whichever is
25 applicable.
26 (c) Provisions Except as set forth otherwise in this chapter and in chapter 23 of title 45,
27 provisions may be made for the merger of contiguous unimproved, or improved and unimproved,
28 substandard lots of record in the same ownership to create dimensionally conforming lots or to
29 reduce the extent of dimensional nonconformance. The ordinance shall specify the standards, on a
30 district by district basis, which determine the mergers. The standards shall include, but are not to
31 be limited to, the availability of infrastructure, the character of the neighborhood, and the
32 consistency with the comprehensive plan. The merger of lots shall not be required when the
33 substandard lot of record has an area equal to or greater than the area of fifty percent (50%) of the
34 lots within two hundred feet (200′) of the subject lot, as confirmed by the zoning enforcement

2 rules and regulations for professional land surveying.
3 45-24-46. Special provisions — Modification.
4 (a) A zoning ordinance shall provide for the issuance of modifications from the literal
5 dimensional requirements of the zoning ordinance in the instance of the construction, alteration, or
6 structural modification of a structure or lot of record. The zoning enforcement officer is authorized
7 to grant modification permits. The zoning ordinance shall permit modifications that are fifteen
8 percent (15%) or less of the any dimensional requirements specified in the zoning ordinance but
9 may permit modification up to twenty-five percent (25%). A modification does not permit moving
10 of lot lines. Within ten (10) days of the receipt of a request for a modification, the zoning
11 enforcement officer shall make a decision as to the suitability of the requested modification based
12 on the following determinations:
13 (1) The modification requested is reasonably necessary for the full enjoyment of the
14 permitted use minimal to a reasonable enjoyment of the permitted use to which the property is
15 proposed to be devoted;
16 (2) If the modification is granted, neighboring property will neither be substantially injured
17 nor its appropriate use substantially impaired;
18 (3) The modification requested does not require a variance of a flood hazard requirement,
19 unless the building is built in accordance with applicable regulations; and
20 (4) The modification requested does not violate any rules or regulations with respect to
21 freshwater or coastal wetlands.
22 (b) Upon an affirmative determination, in the case of a modification of five percent (5%)
23 or less, the zoning enforcement officer shall have the authority to issue a permit approving the
24 modification, without any public notice requirements. In the case of a modification of greater than
25 five percent (5%), the zoning enforcement officer shall notify, by first class mail, all property
26 owners abutting the property which is the subject of the modification request, and shall indicate the
27 street address of the subject property in the notice, and shall publish in a newspaper of local
28 circulation within the city or town that the modification will be granted unless written objection by
29 anyone who is entitled to notice under this section is received within fourteen (14) days of the
30 public notice. If written objection is received within fourteen (14) days, the request for a
31 modification shall be scheduled for the next available hearing before the zoning board of review
32 on application for a dimensional variance following the standard procedures for such variances,
33 including notice requirements provided for under this chapter. If no written objections are received
34 within fourteen (14) days, the zoning enforcement officer shall grant the modification. The zoning
LC002875/SUB A - Page 35 of 42
1 enforcement officer may apply any special conditions to the permit as may, in the opinion of the
2 officer, be required to conform to the intent and purposes of the zoning ordinance. The zoning
3 enforcement officer shall keep public records of all requests for modifications, and of findings,
4 determinations, special conditions, and any objections received. Costs of any notice required under
5 this subsection shall be borne by the applicant requesting the modification.
6 (c) Neighborhood character-based modifications (“NCBM”). The zoning enforcement
7 officer is authorized to grant NCBM on any parcel with a public water and sewer connection, and
8 for purposes of residential use, from the literal dimensional requirements of the zoning ordinance
9 in the instance of the construction, alteration, creation or structural modification of a dwelling unit,
10 provided that:
11 (1) Such modifications shall only be granted for dimensional relief from frontage, lot width,
12 and lot depth, up to the average dimensions of the comparable existing built environment;
13 (2) The average dimensions of the comparable existing built environment shall be
14 calculated as follows:
15 (i) Comparable existing parcels shall mean all parcels that are:
16 (A) Within two hundred feet (200') of the subject property; and
17 (B) In the same base zone; and
18 (C) Used for residential purposes.
19 (ii) The average dimensions shall be confirmed by a professional land surveyor.
20 (iii) The average dimensions are to be determined without any additional review of zoning
21 or building code analysis of the legality of the existing dimensions of the comparable existing
22 parcels.
23 (3) Within ten (10) days of the receipt of a request for NCBM, the zoning enforcement
24 officer shall make a decision as to the suitability of the requested modification based on the
25 following determinations:
26 (i) The modification requested does not require a variance of a flood hazard requirement,
27 unless the building is built in accordance with applicable regulations; and
28 (ii) The modification requested does not violate any rules or regulations with respect to
29 freshwater or coastal wetlands; and
30 (iii) The NCBM does not violate any provisions regarding separation included in the state
31 building or fire code;
32 (4) Upon an affirmative determination, in the case of an NCBM modification of equal to
33 or less than thirty percent (30%) of the requirements of the zoning district, the zoning enforcement
34 officer shall have the authority to issue a permit approving the modification, without any public
LC002875/SUB A - Page 36 of 42
1 notice requirements. In the case of an NCBM modification of greater than thirty percent (30%), the
2 zoning enforcement officer shall notify, by first class mail, all property owners abutting the
3 property which is the subject of the NCBM modification request, and shall indicate the street
4 address of the subject property in the notice, and shall publish in a newspaper of local circulation
5 within the city or town that the modification will be granted unless written objection is received
6 within fourteen (14) days of the public notice. If written objection is received from any party
7 entitled to notice under this section within fourteen (14) days, the request for a modification shall
8 be scheduled for the next available hearing before the zoning board of review on application for a
9 dimensional variance following the standard procedures for such variances, including notice
10 requirements provided for under this chapter. If no written objections are received within fourteen
11 (14) days, the zoning enforcement officer shall grant the modification. The zoning enforcement
12 officer may apply any special conditions to the permit as may, in the opinion of the officer, be
13 required to conform to the intent and purposes of the zoning ordinance. The zoning enforcement
14 officer shall keep public records of all requests for modifications, and of findings, determinations,
15 special conditions, and any objections received. Costs of any notice required under this subsection
16 shall be borne by the applicant requesting the modification.
17 45-24-46.1. Inclusionary zoning. [Effective January 1, 2025.]
18 (a) A zoning ordinance requiring the inclusion of affordable housing as part of a
19 development shall provide that the housing will be affordable housing, as defined in § 42-128-
20 8.1(d)(1); that the affordable housing will constitute not less than fifteen percent (15%) of the total
21 units proposed for the development; and that the units will remain affordable for a period of not
22 less than thirty (30) years from initial occupancy enforced through a land lease and/or deed
23 restriction enforceable by the municipality and the state of Rhode Island. A zoning ordinance that
24 requires the inclusion of affordable housing as part of a development shall specify the threshold in
25 which the inclusion of affordable housing is required, but in no event shall a minimum threshold
26 triggering the inclusion of affordable housing be higher than ten (10) dwelling units. The total
27 number of units for the development may include less than fifteen percent (15%) affordable units
28 after the density bonus described in subsection (c) of this section is determined. A municipality
29 shall not limit the number of bedrooms for applications submitted under this section to anything
30 less than three (3) bedrooms per dwelling unit for single-family dwelling units.
31 (b) A zoning ordinance that includes inclusionary zoning may provide that the affordable
32 housing must be built on-site or it may allow for one or more alternative methods of production,
33 including, but not limited to: off-site construction or rehabilitation; donation of land suitable for
34 development of the required affordable units; and/or the payment of a fee in lieu of the construction
LC002875/SUB A - Page 37 of 42
1 or provision of affordable housing units.
2 (c) Density bonus, zoning incentives, and municipal subsidies. For all projects subject
3 to inclusionary zoning, subject to applicable setback, lot width, or frontage requirements or the
4 granting of relief from the same, a municipality shall allow the addition of one market rate unit for
5 each affordable unit required and the minimum lot area per dwelling unit normally required in the
6 applicable zoning district shall be reduced by that amount necessary to accommodate the
7 development. Larger density bonuses for the provision of an increased percentage of affordable
8 housing in a development may be provided by a municipality in the zoning ordinance. The total
9 number of units for the development shall equal the number originally proposed, including the
10 required affordable units, plus the additional units that constitute the density bonus. Local
11 regulations shall provide for reasonable relief from dimensional requirements to accommodate the
12 bonus density under this section. A municipality shall provide, and an applicant may request,
13 additional zoning incentives and/or municipal government subsidies as defined in § 45-53-3 to
14 offset differential costs of affordable units. Available zoning incentives and municipal government
15 subsidies may be listed in the zoning ordinance, but shall not be an exclusive list.
16 (1) Inclusionary zoning requirements shall not be applied where there is a limitation on the
17 development density at the subject property under the regulations of a state agency, such as the
18 coastal resources management council or department of environmental management that prevents
19 the use of the density bonus set forth in this section.
20 (d) Fee-in-lieu. To the extent a municipality provides an option for the payment of a fee-
21 in-lieu of the construction or provision of affordable housing, and an application seeks to utilize
22 fee-in-lieu, the use of such fee shall be the choice of the developer or builder applied on a per-unit
23 basis and may be used for new developments, purchasing property and/or homes, rehabilitating
24 properties, or any other manner that creates additional low- or moderate-income housing as defined
25 in § 45-53-3(9).
26 (1) Eligibility for density bonus. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, an
27 application that utilizes a fee-in-lieu, off-site construction or rehabilitation, or donation of land
28 suitable for development of the required affordable units shall not be eligible for the density bonus
29 outlined in this section.
30 (2) An application that seeks to utilize a fee-in-lieu of the construction or provision of
31 affordable housing must be reviewed by the planning board or commission and is not eligible for
32 administrative review under the Rhode Island Land Development and Subdivision Review
33 Enabling Act of 1992, codified at §§ 45-23-25 — 45-23-74.
34 (3) Amount of fee-in-lieu. For affordable single-family homes and condominium units, the
LC002875/SUB A - Page 38 of 42
1 per-unit fee shall be the difference between the maximum affordable sales price for a family of four
2 (4) earning eighty percent (80%) of the area median income as determined annually by the U.S.
3 Department of Housing and Urban Development and the average cost of developing a single unit
4 of affordable housing. The average cost of developing a single unit of affordable housing shall be
5 determined annually based on the average, per-unit development cost of affordable homes financed
6 by Rhode Island housing and mortgage finance corporation (RIHMFC) over the previous three (3)
7 years, excluding existing units that received preservation financing.
8 (i) Notwithstanding subsection (d)(3) of this section, in no case shall the per-unit fee for
9 affordable single family homes and condominium units be less than forty thousand dollars
10 ($40,000).
11 (4) Use of fee-in-lieu. The municipality shall deposit all in-lieu payments into restricted
12 accounts that shall be allocated and spent only for the creation and development of affordable
13 housing within the municipality serving individuals or families at or below eighty percent (80%)
14 of the area median income. The municipality shall maintain a local affordable housing board to
15 oversee the funds in the restricted accounts and shall allocate the funds within three (3) years of
16 collection. The municipality shall include in the housing element of their local comprehensive plan
17 and shall pass by ordinance, the process it will use to allocate the funds.
18 (e) As an alternative to the provisions of subsection (d), the municipality may elect to
19 transfer in-lieu payments promptly upon receipt or within the three-year (3) period after receipt. A
20 municipality shall transfer all fee-in-lieu payments that are not allocated within three (3) years of
21 collection, including funds held as of July 1, 2024, to RIHMFC for the purpose of developing
22 affordable housing within that community.
23 (f) Both the municipalities and RIHMFC shall report annually with the first report due
24 December 31, 2024, to the general assembly, the secretary of housing, and the housing resources
25 commission the amount of fees in lieu collected by community, the projects that were provided
26 funding with the fees, the dollar amounts allocated to the projects, and the number of units created.
27 45-24-46.4. Special provisions — Unified development review.
28 (a) A zoning ordinance shall provide that review and decision on variances and/or special-
29 use permits for properties undergoing review which qualifies for unified development review by
30 the authorized permitting authority, be conducted and decided by the authorized permitting
31 authority. This process is to be known as unified development review.
32 (b) The local ordinance and regulation shall provide for the application and review process
33 pursuant to § 45-23-50.1.
34 (c) A zoning ordinance that provides for unified development review shall:
LC002875/SUB A - Page 39 of 42
1 (1) Empower the authorized permitting authority to grant, grant with conditions, or deny
2 zoning relief; and
3 (2) Provide that any person, group, agency, or corporation that files an application for a
4 project under this section shall also file specific requests for relief from the literal requirements of
5 a zoning ordinance on the subject property, pursuant to § 45-24-41, and/or for the issuance of
6 special-use permits for the subject property, pursuant to § 45-24-42, by including such within the
7 application to the administrative officer with the other required application materials, pursuant to
8 § 45-23-50.1(b).
9 (d) [Deleted by P.L. 2023, ch. 308, § 2 and P.L. 2023, ch. 309, § 2.]
10 (e) All land development and subdivision applications that include requests for variances
11 and/or special-use permits submitted pursuant to this section shall require a public hearing that
12 meets the requirements of § 45-23-50.1.
13 (f) In granting requests for dimensional and use variances, the authorized permitting
14 authority shall be bound to the requirements of § 45-24-41 relative to entering evidence into the
15 record in satisfaction of the applicable standards except that for subdivisions submitted under this
16 section, if an applicant seeks relief from the dimensional requirements as part of its proposed
17 subdivision, the standard in § 45-24-41(d)(2) shall not apply to prohibit the granting of the relief.
18 (g) In reviewing requests for special-use permits, the authorized permitting authority shall
19 be bound to the conditions and procedures under which a special-use permit may be issued and the
20 criteria for the issuance of such permits, as found within the zoning ordinance pursuant to § 45-24-
21 42, and shall be required to provide for the recording of findings of fact and written decisions as
22 described in the zoning ordinance pursuant to § 45-24-42.
23 (h) An appeal from any decision made pursuant to this section may be taken pursuant to §
24 45-23-71.
25 45-24-77. Transit-oriented development pilot program.
26 (a) Findings and declarations. The general assembly finds and declares that in order to
27 increase the availability of residential housing near convenient public transportation, alleviate
28 traffic congestion, and further the goals of chapter 6.2 of title 42, the Act on Climate, enacted in
29 2021, there is a need to identify growth centers for higher density housing, considering the capacity
30 for water service, sewer service, transit connections, and employment centers.
31 (b) Establishment. To fulfill the findings and declarations of this section, a transit-oriented
32 development pilot program is hereby established that shall allow developers or municipalities to
33 apply for funds for residential development.
34 (c) Applicability. Effective January 1, 2024, in addition to the criteria to be established by
LC002875/SUB A - Page 40 of 42
1 the department of housing as set forth in subsection (d) of this section, to qualify for funding
2 through the pilot program, a municipality must have the development must include developable
3 land or properties that is within a one-quarter (¼) mile radius of a an existing or planned regional
4 mobility hub or a one-eighth (⅛) mile radius of a an existing or planned frequent transit stop as
5 such terms are defined in the 2020 Rhode Island transit master plan or its successor document.
6 (d) Authority. The department of housing, in conjunction with input and data from the
7 department of transportation and division of statewide planning, is hereby authorized to promulgate
8 rules and regulations consistent with this section that establish:
9 (1) The criteria to qualify for consideration into the pilot program, including but not limited
10 to;
11 (i) For municipalities to apply to have zoning districts certified into the program, an
12 established zoning district or overlay, or other provisions that provide for high density residential
13 development, and the easing for dimensional restrictions and parking requirements for such
14 development; and
15 (ii) For developers to qualify for funding through the program, that the project includes
16 some portion of the residential units in the development to be affordable housing;
17 (2) The process for the application, and submission requirements for municipalities to
18 apply to have zoning districts certified into the program and for developers or municipalities to
19 apply to receive funding and pre-requisites, including, but not limited to, an established zoning
20 overlay district or other provisions that provide increased density for residential development at a
21 minimum of ten units per acre (10 U/A), mandates for the development of affordable housing, and
22 the easing of dimensional restrictions and parking requirements for such development;
23 (3) Criteria The process for acceptance into the pilot program;
24 (4) Reporting requirements for municipalities accepted into the pilot program; and
25 (5) Penalties for lack of compliance with the pilot program regulations.

33 housing; and
34 (C) The development has access to public sewer and water service or has access to adequate
LC002875/SUB A - Page 32 of 42

1 private water, such as a well and and/or wastewater treatment system(s) approved by the relevant
2 state agency for the entire development as applicable.
3 (ii) For all other adaptive reuse projects, the residential density permitted in the converted
4 structure shall be the maximum allowed that otherwise meets all standards of minimum housing
5 and has access to public sewer and water service or has access to adequate private water, such as a
6 well, and wastewater treatment system(s) approved by the relevant state agency for the entire
7 development, as applicable. The density proposed shall be determined to meet all public health and
8 safety standards.
9 (3)(iii) Existing setbacks. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, for
10 adaptive reuse projects, existing building setbacks shall remain and shall be considered legal
11 nonconforming, but no additional encroachments shall be permitted into any nonconforming
12 setback, unless otherwise allowed by local zoning ordinance or relief is granted by the applicable
13 authority.
14 (4)(iv) Height. For adaptive reuse projects, notwithstanding any other provisions of this
15 chapter, the height of the existing structure, if it exceeds the maximum height of the zoning district,
16 may remain and shall be considered legal nonconforming, and any non-occupiable rooftop
17 construction such as HVAC equipment and stairs or elevator towers, but excluding rooftop decks,
18 shall be included within the height exemption.
19 (4) Water and sewer. The development shall have access to public water and sewer services
20 or shall have access to adequate private water, such as a well(s) and and/or on-site wastewater
21 treatment system(s) approved by the relevant state agency.
22 (i) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, all towns and cities may shall
23 allow manufactured homes, as defined in § 45-24-31, that comply with § 23-27.3-109.1.3 as a type
24 of single-family home on any lot zoned for single-family use. Such home shall comply with all
25 dimensional requirements of a single-family home in the district or seek relief for the same under
26 the provisions of this chapter.
27 45-24-38. General provisions — Substandard lots of record.
28 (a) Any city or town adopting or amending a zoning ordinance under this chapter shall
29 regulate the development of any single substandard lot of record or contiguous lots of record at the
30 effective date of adoption or amendment of the zoning ordinance.
31 (b) Notwithstanding the failure of that lot or those lots to meet the dimensional and/or
32 quantitative requirements, and/or road frontage or other access requirements, applicable in the
33 district as stated in the ordinance, a substandard lot of record shall not be required to seek any
34 zoning relief based solely on the failure to meet minimum requirements for lot size requirements,
LC002875/SUB A - Page 33 of 42

1 lot frontage, lot width or lot depth of the district in which such lot is located. For any structure
2 proposed under this section on a substandard lot of record, the following dimensional regulations
3 shall apply:
4 (1) Minimum building setbacks, lot frontage, and lot width requirements for a lot that is
5 nonconforming in area shall be reduced by applying the building setback, lot frontage, and lot width
6 requirements from another zoning district in the municipality in which the subject lot would be
7 conforming as to lot area. If the subject lot is not conforming as to lot area in any zoning district in
8 the municipality, the setbacks, lot frontage, and lot width shall be reduced by the same proportion
9 that the area of such substandard lot meets the minimum lot area of the district in which the lot is
10 located. By way of example, if the lot area of a substandard lot only meets forty percent (40%) of
11 the minimum lot area required in the district in which it is located, the setbacks, lot frontage, and
12 lot width shall each be reduced to forty percent (40%) of the requirements for those dimensional
13 standards in the same district. However, to the extent the city or town has a zoning district in which
14 the lot would be conforming as to size, the city or town may require compliance with the building
15 setback, lot frontage, and lot width requirements for said zoning district if such requirement is in
16 the local zoning ordinance.
17 (2) Maximum lot building coverage for lots that are nonconforming in area shall be
18 increased by the inverse proportion that the area of such substandard lot meets the minimum area
19 requirements in the district in which the lot is located. By way of example, if the lot area of a
20 substandard lot only meets forty percent (40%) of the required minimum lot area, the maximum lot
21 building coverage is allowed to increase by sixty percent (60%) over the maximum permitted lot
22 building coverage in that district.
23 All proposals exceeding such reduced requirement shall proceed with a modification
24 request under § 45-24-46 or a dimensional variance request under § 45-24-41, whichever is
25 applicable.
26 (c) Provisions Except as set forth otherwise in this chapter and in chapter 23 of title 45,
27 provisions may be made for the merger of contiguous unimproved, or improved and unimproved,
28 substandard lots of record in the same ownership to create dimensionally conforming lots or to
29 reduce the extent of dimensional nonconformance. The ordinance shall specify the standards, on a
30 district by district basis, which determine the mergers. The standards shall include, but are not to
31 be limited to, the availability of infrastructure, the character of the neighborhood, and the
32 consistency with the comprehensive plan. The merger of lots shall not be required when the
33 substandard lot of record has an area equal to or greater than the area of fifty percent (50%) of the
34 lots within two hundred feet (200′) of the subject lot, as confirmed by the zoning enforcement
LC002875/SUB A - Page 34 of 42

1 officer a compilation plan signed by a professional land surveyor as such term is defined by the
2 rules and regulations for professional land surveying.
3 45-24-46. Special provisions — Modification.
4 (a) A zoning ordinance shall provide for the issuance of modifications from the literal
5 dimensional requirements of the zoning ordinance in the instance of the construction, alteration, or
6 structural modification of a structure or lot of record. The zoning enforcement officer is authorized
7 to grant modification permits. The zoning ordinance shall permit modifications that are fifteen
8 percent (15%) or less of the any dimensional requirements specified in the zoning ordinance but
9 may permit modification up to twenty-five percent (25%). A modification does not permit moving
10 of lot lines. Within ten (10) days of the receipt of a request for a modification, the zoning
11 enforcement officer shall make a decision as to the suitability of the requested modification based
12 on the following determinations:
13 (1) The modification requested is reasonably necessary for the full enjoyment of the
14 permitted use minimal to a reasonable enjoyment of the permitted use to which the property is
15 proposed to be devoted;
16 (2) If the modification is granted, neighboring property will neither be substantially injured
17 nor its appropriate use substantially impaired;
18 (3) The modification requested does not require a variance of a flood hazard requirement,
19 unless the building is built in accordance with applicable regulations; and
20 (4) The modification requested does not violate any rules or regulations with respect to
21 freshwater or coastal wetlands.
22 (b) Upon an affirmative determination, in the case of a modification of five percent (5%)
23 or less, the zoning enforcement officer shall have the authority to issue a permit approving the
24 modification, without any public notice requirements. In the case of a modification of greater than
25 five percent (5%), the zoning enforcement officer shall notify, by first class mail, all property
26 owners abutting the property which is the subject of the modification request, and shall indicate the
27 street address of the subject property in the notice, and shall publish in a newspaper of local
28 circulation within the city or town that the modification will be granted unless written objection by
29 anyone who is entitled to notice under this section is received within fourteen (14) days of the
30 public notice. If written objection is received within fourteen (14) days, the request for a
31 modification shall be scheduled for the next available hearing before the zoning board of review
32 on application for a dimensional variance following the standard procedures for such variances,
33 including notice requirements provided for under this chapter. If no written objections are received
34 within fourteen (14) days, the zoning enforcement officer shall grant the modification. The zoning
LC002875/SUB A - Page 35 of 42

1 enforcement officer may apply any special conditions to the permit as may, in the opinion of the
2 officer, be required to conform to the intent and purposes of the zoning ordinance. The zoning
3 enforcement officer shall keep public records of all requests for modifications, and of findings,
4 determinations, special conditions, and any objections received. Costs of any notice required under
5 this subsection shall be borne by the applicant requesting the modification.
6 (c) Neighborhood character-based modifications (“NCBM”). The zoning enforcement
7 officer is authorized to grant NCBM on any parcel with a public water and sewer connection, and
8 for purposes of residential use, from the literal dimensional requirements of the zoning ordinance
9 in the instance of the construction, alteration, creation or structural modification of a dwelling unit,
10 provided that:
11 (1) Such modifications shall only be granted for dimensional relief from frontage, lot width,
12 and lot depth, up to the average dimensions of the comparable existing built environment;
13 (2) The average dimensions of the comparable existing built environment shall be
14 calculated as follows:
15 (i) Comparable existing parcels shall mean all parcels that are:
16 (A) Within two hundred feet (200') of the subject property; and
17 (B) In the same base zone; and
18 (C) Used for residential purposes.
19 (ii) The average dimensions shall be confirmed by a professional land surveyor.
20 (iii) The average dimensions are to be determined without any additional review of zoning
21 or building code analysis of the legality of the existing dimensions of the comparable existing
22 parcels.
23 (3) Within ten (10) days of the receipt of a request for NCBM, the zoning enforcement
24 officer shall make a decision as to the suitability of the requested modification based on the
25 following determinations:
26 (i) The modification requested does not require a variance of a flood hazard requirement,
27 unless the building is built in accordance with applicable regulations; and
28 (ii) The modification requested does not violate any rules or regulations with respect to
29 freshwater or coastal wetlands; and
30 (iii) The NCBM does not violate any provisions regarding separation included in the state
31 building or fire code;
32 (4) Upon an affirmative determination, in the case of an NCBM modification of equal to
33 or less than thirty percent (30%) of the requirements of the zoning district, the zoning enforcement
34 officer shall have the authority to issue a permit approving the modification, without any public
LC002875/SUB A - Page 36 of 42

1 notice requirements. In the case of an NCBM modification of greater than thirty percent (30%), the
2 zoning enforcement officer shall notify, by first class mail, all property owners abutting the
3 property which is the subject of the NCBM modification request, and shall indicate the street
4 address of the subject property in the notice, and shall publish in a newspaper of local circulation
5 within the city or town that the modification will be granted unless written objection is received
6 within fourteen (14) days of the public notice. If written objection is received from any party
7 entitled to notice under this section within fourteen (14) days, the request for a modification shall
8 be scheduled for the next available hearing before the zoning board of review on application for a
9 dimensional variance following the standard procedures for such variances, including notice
10 requirements provided for under this chapter. If no written objections are received within fourteen
11 (14) days, the zoning enforcement officer shall grant the modification. The zoning enforcement
12 officer may apply any special conditions to the permit as may, in the opinion of the officer, be
13 required to conform to the intent and purposes of the zoning ordinance. The zoning enforcement
14 officer shall keep public records of all requests for modifications, and of findings, determinations,
15 special conditions, and any objections received. Costs of any notice required under this subsection
16 shall be borne by the applicant requesting the modification.
17 45-24-46.1. Inclusionary zoning. [Effective January 1, 2025.]
18 (a) A zoning ordinance requiring the inclusion of affordable housing as part of a
19 development shall provide that the housing will be affordable housing, as defined in § 42-128-
20 8.1(d)(1); that the affordable housing will constitute not less than fifteen percent (15%) of the total
21 units proposed for the development; and that the units will remain affordable for a period of not
22 less than thirty (30) years from initial occupancy enforced through a land lease and/or deed
23 restriction enforceable by the municipality and the state of Rhode Island. A zoning ordinance that
24 requires the inclusion of affordable housing as part of a development shall specify the threshold in
25 which the inclusion of affordable housing is required, but in no event shall a minimum threshold
26 triggering the inclusion of affordable housing be higher than ten (10) dwelling units. The total
27 number of units for the development may include less than fifteen percent (15%) affordable units
28 after the density bonus described in subsection (c) of this section is determined. A municipality
29 shall not limit the number of bedrooms for applications submitted under this section to anything
30 less than three (3) bedrooms per dwelling unit for single-family dwelling units.
31 (b) A zoning ordinance that includes inclusionary zoning may provide that the affordable
32 housing must be built on-site or it may allow for one or more alternative methods of production,
33 including, but not limited to: off-site construction or rehabilitation; donation of land suitable for
34 development of the required affordable units; and/or the payment of a fee in lieu of the construction
LC002875/SUB A - Page 37 of 42

1 or provision of affordable housing units.
2 (c) Density bonus, zoning incentives, and municipal subsidies. For all projects subject
3 to inclusionary zoning, subject to applicable setback, lot width, or frontage requirements or the
4 granting of relief from the same, a municipality shall allow the addition of one market rate unit for
5 each affordable unit required and the minimum lot area per dwelling unit normally required in the
6 applicable zoning district shall be reduced by that amount necessary to accommodate the
7 development. Larger density bonuses for the provision of an increased percentage of affordable
8 housing in a development may be provided by a municipality in the zoning ordinance. The total
9 number of units for the development shall equal the number originally proposed, including the
10 required affordable units, plus the additional units that constitute the density bonus. Local
11 regulations shall provide for reasonable relief from dimensional requirements to accommodate the
12 bonus density under this section. A municipality shall provide, and an applicant may request,
13 additional zoning incentives and/or municipal government subsidies as defined in § 45-53-3 to
14 offset differential costs of affordable units. Available zoning incentives and municipal government
15 subsidies may be listed in the zoning ordinance, but shall not be an exclusive list.
16 (1) Inclusionary zoning requirements shall not be applied where there is a limitation on the
17 development density at the subject property under the regulations of a state agency, such as the
18 coastal resources management council or department of environmental management that prevents
19 the use of the density bonus set forth in this section.
20 (d) Fee-in-lieu. To the extent a municipality provides an option for the payment of a fee-
21 in-lieu of the construction or provision of affordable housing, and an application seeks to utilize
22 fee-in-lieu, the use of such fee shall be the choice of the developer or builder applied on a per-unit
23 basis and may be used for new developments, purchasing property and/or homes, rehabilitating
24 properties, or any other manner that creates additional low- or moderate-income housing as defined
25 in § 45-53-3(9).
26 (1) Eligibility for density bonus. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, an
27 application that utilizes a fee-in-lieu, off-site construction or rehabilitation, or donation of land
28 suitable for development of the required affordable units shall not be eligible for the density bonus
29 outlined in this section.
30 (2) An application that seeks to utilize a fee-in-lieu of the construction or provision of
31 affordable housing must be reviewed by the planning board or commission and is not eligible for
32 administrative review under the Rhode Island Land Development and Subdivision Review
33 Enabling Act of 1992, codified at §§ 45-23-25 — 45-23-74.
34 (3) Amount of fee-in-lieu. For affordable single-family homes and condominium units, the
LC002875/SUB A - Page 38 of 42

1 per-unit fee shall be the difference between the maximum affordable sales price for a family of four
2 (4) earning eighty percent (80%) of the area median income as determined annually by the U.S.
3 Department of Housing and Urban Development and the average cost of developing a single unit
4 of affordable housing. The average cost of developing a single unit of affordable housing shall be
5 determined annually based on the average, per-unit development cost of affordable homes financed
6 by Rhode Island housing and mortgage finance corporation (RIHMFC) over the previous three (3)
7 years, excluding existing units that received preservation financing.
8 (i) Notwithstanding subsection (d)(3) of this section, in no case shall the per-unit fee for
9 affordable single family homes and condominium units be less than forty thousand dollars
10 ($40,000).
11 (4) Use of fee-in-lieu. The municipality shall deposit all in-lieu payments into restricted
12 accounts that shall be allocated and spent only for the creation and development of affordable
13 housing within the municipality serving individuals or families at or below eighty percent (80%)
14 of the area median income. The municipality shall maintain a local affordable housing board to
15 oversee the funds in the restricted accounts and shall allocate the funds within three (3) years of
16 collection. The municipality shall include in the housing element of their local comprehensive plan
17 and shall pass by ordinance, the process it will use to allocate the funds.
18 (e) As an alternative to the provisions of subsection (d), the municipality may elect to
19 transfer in-lieu payments promptly upon receipt or within the three-year (3) period after receipt. A
20 municipality shall transfer all fee-in-lieu payments that are not allocated within three (3) years of
21 collection, including funds held as of July 1, 2024, to RIHMFC for the purpose of developing
22 affordable housing within that community.
23 (f) Both the municipalities and RIHMFC shall report annually with the first report due
24 December 31, 2024, to the general assembly, the secretary of housing, and the housing resources
25 commission the amount of fees in lieu collected by community, the projects that were provided
26 funding with the fees, the dollar amounts allocated to the projects, and the number of units created.
27 45-24-46.4. Special provisions — Unified development review.
28 (a) A zoning ordinance shall provide that review and decision on variances and/or special-
29 use permits for properties undergoing review which qualifies for unified development review by
30 the authorized permitting authority, be conducted and decided by the authorized permitting
31 authority. This process is to be known as unified development review.
32 (b) The local ordinance and regulation shall provide for the application and review process
33 pursuant to § 45-23-50.1.
34 (c) A zoning ordinance that provides for unified development review shall:
LC002875/SUB A - Page 39 of 42

1 (1) Empower the authorized permitting authority to grant, grant with conditions, or deny
2 zoning relief; and
3 (2) Provide that any person, group, agency, or corporation that files an application for a
4 project under this section shall also file specific requests for relief from the literal requirements of
5 a zoning ordinance on the subject property, pursuant to § 45-24-41, and/or for the issuance of
6 special-use permits for the subject property, pursuant to § 45-24-42, by including such within the
7 application to the administrative officer with the other required application materials, pursuant to
8 § 45-23-50.1(b).
9 (d) [Deleted by P.L. 2023, ch. 308, § 2 and P.L. 2023, ch. 309, § 2.]
10 (e) All land development and subdivision applications that include requests for variances
11 and/or special-use permits submitted pursuant to this section shall require a public hearing that
12 meets the requirements of § 45-23-50.1.
13 (f) In granting requests for dimensional and use variances, the authorized permitting
14 authority shall be bound to the requirements of § 45-24-41 relative to entering evidence into the
15 record in satisfaction of the applicable standards except that for subdivisions submitted under this
16 section, if an applicant seeks relief from the dimensional requirements as part of its proposed
17 subdivision, the standard in § 45-24-41(d)(2) shall not apply to prohibit the granting of the relief.
18 (g) In reviewing requests for special-use permits, the authorized permitting authority shall
19 be bound to the conditions and procedures under which a special-use permit may be issued and the
20 criteria for the issuance of such permits, as found within the zoning ordinance pursuant to § 45-24-
21 42, and shall be required to provide for the recording of findings of fact and written decisions as
22 described in the zoning ordinance pursuant to § 45-24-42.
23 (h) An appeal from any decision made pursuant to this section may be taken pursuant to §
24 45-23-71.
25 45-24-77. Transit-oriented development pilot program.
26 (a) Findings and declarations. The general assembly finds and declares that in order to
27 increase the availability of residential housing near convenient public transportation, alleviate
28 traffic congestion, and further the goals of chapter 6.2 of title 42, the Act on Climate, enacted in
29 2021, there is a need to identify growth centers for higher density housing, considering the capacity
30 for water service, sewer service, transit connections, and employment centers.
31 (b) Establishment. To fulfill the findings and declarations of this section, a transit-oriented
32 development pilot program is hereby established that shall allow developers or municipalities to
33 apply for funds for residential development.
34 (c) Applicability. Effective January 1, 2024, in addition to the criteria to be established by
LC002875/SUB A - Page 40 of 42

1 the department of housing as set forth in subsection (d) of this section, to qualify for funding
2 through the pilot program, a municipality must have the development must include developable
3 land or properties that is within a one-quarter (¼) mile radius of a an existing or planned regional
4 mobility hub or a one-eighth (⅛) mile radius of a an existing or planned frequent transit stop as
5 such terms are defined in the 2020 Rhode Island transit master plan or its successor document.
6 (d) Authority. The department of housing, in conjunction with input and data from the
7 department of transportation and division of statewide planning, is hereby authorized to promulgate
8 rules and regulations consistent with this section that establish:
9 (1) The criteria to qualify for consideration into the pilot program, including but not limited
10 to;
11 (i) For municipalities to apply to have zoning districts certified into the program, an
12 established zoning district or overlay, or other provisions that provide for high density residential
13 development, and the easing for dimensional restrictions and parking requirements for such
14 development; and
15 (ii) For developers to qualify for funding through the program, that the project includes
16 some portion of the residential units in the development to be affordable housing;
17 (2) The process for the application, and submission requirements for municipalities to
18 apply to have zoning districts certified into the program and for developers or municipalities to
19 apply to receive funding and pre-requisites, including, but not limited to, an established zoning
20 overlay district or other provisions that provide increased density for residential development at a
21 minimum of ten units per acre (10 U/A), mandates for the development of affordable housing, and
22 the easing of dimensional restrictions and parking requirements for such development;
23 (3) Criteria The process for acceptance into the pilot program;
24 (4) Reporting requirements for municipalities accepted into the pilot program; and
