PROCLAIMING JANUARY OF 2025, TO BE "FIREFIGHTER CANCER AWARENESS
MONTH" IN THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND
Introduced By: Representatives Casimiro, Casey, Shekarchi, Blazejewski, Chippendale,
Kazarian, Solomon, Kennedy, Ackerman, and Ajello
Date Introduced: January 14, 2025
Referred To: House read and passed
1 WHEREAS, Tragically, occupational cancer has surpassed heart disease as the leading
2 line-of-duty cause of death among firefighters. In 2023, 63 percent of the firefighters added to the
3 International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF) National Fallen Fire Fighters Memorial died
4 from occupational cancer; and
5 WHEREAS, In response to this growing problem, the IAFF and the Firefighter Support
6 Network are teaming up and combining resources to tackle this growing problem and are working
7 tirelessly and striving daily to reduce the impact of cancer on firefighters through better education
8 and prevention resources within fire departments across the nation and with a particular focus on
9 early detection; and
10 WHEREAS, According to the Firefighter Cancer Support Network, firefighters have a
11 nine percent higher risk of being diagnosed with cancer and a fourteen percent higher risk of
12 dying from cancer than the general United States population citing research conducted by the
13 CDC/National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety (NIOSH). The cancers most
14 responsible for this higher risk are respiratory (lung and mesothelioma), GI (oral cavity,
15 esophageal, large intestine) and kidney; and
16 WHEREAS, Overall, firefighters have a greater risk of getting certain cancers than the
17 general public with testicular cancer being 2.02 times higher, mesothelioma being 2 times higher,
18 multiple myeloma 1.53 times higher, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma being 1.51 times higher, skin
19 cancer being 1.39 times higher, malignant melanoma being 1.31 times higher, brain cancer being

1 1.31 times higher, prostate cancer being 1.28 times higher, colon cancer being 1.21 times higher,
2 and leukemia being 1.14 times higher; and
3 WHEREAS, America's and Rhode Island's firefighters are dedicated public safety
4 professionals who often risk life and limb to protect people's lives and property. They deserve our
5 support and the resources necessary to do everything possible to reduce their greater chances of
6 being diagnosed with and perishing from cancer; now, therefore be it
7 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
8 proclaims January of 2025, to be "Firefighter Cancer Awareness Month" in the State of Rhode
9 Island; and be it further
10 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
11 transmit a duly certified copy of this resolution to the International Association of Fire Fighters
12 (IAFF).
