15 available either directly, by such original equipment manufacturer or via an authorized repair
16 provider or distributor.
17 (b) An original equipment manufacturer shall not use parts pairing or any other mechanism
18 to:
1 (1) Prevent the installation or functioning of any otherwise-functional part, including a
2 non-manufacturer approved replacement part or component;
3 (2) Inhibit or reduce the functioning of any part, such that replacement by an independent
4 repair provider or the device owner, would cause the device to operate with reduced functionality
5 or performance;
6 (3) Create false, misleading, deceptive, or non-dismissible alerts or warnings about parts;
7 (4) Charge additional fees or increased prices for future repairs; or
8 (5) Limit who can purchase parts or perform repair services.

33 be void and unenforceable.
34 (c) No original equipment manufacturer or authorized repair provider shall be liable for
LC000754 - Page 4 of 6
1 any damage or injury to any digital electronic equipment caused by an independent repair provider
2 or owner, which occurs during the course of repair, diagnosis, or maintenance and is not attributable
3 to the original equipment manufacturer or authorized repair provider, other than if the failure is
4 attributable to design or manufacturing defects.
