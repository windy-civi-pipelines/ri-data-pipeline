It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:

3 CHAPTER 30
4 DECEPTIVE AND FRAUDULENT SYNTHETIC MEDIA IN ELECTION
5 COMMUNICATIONS
6 17-30-1. Deceptive synthetic media.
7 (a) For purposes of this chapter, “candidate” means and includes an incumbent or current
8 office holder.
9 (b) For purposes of this chapter, “synthetic media” means an image, an audio recording, or
10 a video recording of an individual’s appearance, speech, or conduct that has been intentionally
11 manipulated with the use of generative adversarial network techniques or other digital technology
12 to create a realistic but false image, audio, or video that produces:
13 (1) A depiction that, to a reasonable individual, appears to be a real individual in terms of
14 appearance, action, or speech, but that did not occur in reality; and
15 (2) A fundamentally different understanding or impression of the appearance, action, or
16 speech than a reasonable person would have from the unaltered, original version of the image, audio
17 recording, or video recording.
18 (c) A candidate, authorized candidate campaign committee, political action committee,

1 political party committee, or person or entity making an independent expenditure as defined in §
2 17-25-3 shall not, within ninety (90) days of any election at which a candidate for elective office
3 will appear on a ballot, distribute synthetic media that the candidate, authorized candidate campaign
4 committee, political action committee, political party committee, or person or entity making an
5 independent expenditure as defined in § 17-25-3 knows or should know is deceptive and fraudulent
6 synthetic media, as defined in subsection (b) of this section.
7 (d)(1) The prohibition in subsection (c) of this section does not apply if the image, audio
8 recording, or video recording includes a disclosure stating that the image has been manipulated or
9 generated by artificial intelligence.
10 (2) For visual media, the text of the disclosure shall appear in a size that is easily readable
11 by the average viewer, and no smaller than the largest font size of any other text appearing in the
12 visual media. If the visual media does not include any other text, the disclosure shall appear in a
13 size that is easily readable by the average viewer. For visual media that is a video, the disclosure
14 shall appear for the duration of the video.
15 (3) If the media consists of audio only, and no visual disclosure is feasible, the disclosure
16 shall be read in a clearly spoken manner, and in a speed and pitch that can be easily heard by the
17 average listener, at the beginning of the audio, at the end of the audio, and, if the audio is greater
18 than two (2) minutes in length, interspersed within the audio at intervals of not greater than two (2)
19 minutes.
20 17-30-2. Right of action.
21 (a) A candidate whose appearance, actions, or speech are depicted through the use of
22 synthetic media in violation of § 17-30-1 may seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a
23 candidate, authorized candidate campaign committee, political action committee, political party
24 committee, or person or entity making an independent expenditure as defined in § 17-25-3
25 prohibiting the distribution of audio or visual synthetic media in violation of this chapter.
26 (b) A candidate whose appearance, actions, or speech are depicted using synthetic media
27 may also bring an action for general or special damages against a candidate, authorized candidate
28 campaign committee, political action committee, political party committee, or person or entity
29 making an independent expenditure as defined in § 17-25-3 that generated the synthetic media. The
30 court may also award a prevailing party reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. This subsection shall
31 not be construed to limit or preclude a plaintiff from recovering under any other available remedy.
32 (c) In any civil action alleging a violation of this chapter, the plaintiff shall bear the burden
33 of establishing the violation through clear and convincing evidence.
34 17-30-3. Application.
