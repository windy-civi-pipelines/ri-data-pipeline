6 WHEREAS, In 1992, Congress expanded the observance to a month-long celebration

14 in the United States Military; and
15 WHEREAS, Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, and native Hawaiians have been serving
16 honorably in the United States Military since the War of 1812; and
17 WHEREAS, The Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander workforce can
18 be found in numerous fields including professional, scientific and technical services, as well as
19 teaching, financial management, engineering, nursing, health care, medicine, social assistance,
1 retail, construction, and repair and maintenance and have paid billions in federal income taxes in
2 addition to state and local taxes; and
3 WHEREAS, There have been connections between China and Rhode Island since the
4 18th Century, as highlighted in a recent exhibition entitled, "The Celestial City: Newport and
5 China," at Rosecliff Mansion from September 2023 to February 2024, which revealed that people
6 of Chinese heritage contributed to life in Newport, including immigrant entrepreneurs, suffragists,
7 merchants, makers and sailors; and
8 WHEREAS, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders (AANHPI) have
9 added to the diversity, strength and vibrancy of our state through their culture, language, and
