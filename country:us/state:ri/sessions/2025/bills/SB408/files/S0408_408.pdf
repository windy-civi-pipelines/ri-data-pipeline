RELATING TO STATE AFFAIRS AND GOVERNMENT -- ENERGY FACILITY SITING
ACT
Introduced By: Senators de la Cruz, Rogers, DiPalma, Ciccone, Raptakis, and E Morgan
Date Introduced: February 26, 2025
Referred To: Senate Environment & Agriculture
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Sections 42-98-1, 42-98-2, 42-98-3, 42-98-5, 42-98-7, 42-98-8, 42-98-9, 42-
2 98-9.1, 42-98-10, 42-98-11 and 42-98-16 of the General Laws in Chapter 42-98 entitled "Energy
3 Facility Siting Act" are hereby amended to read as follows:
4 42-98-1. Legislative findings.
5 (a) The general assembly recognizes that reasonably priced, reliable sources of energy are
6 vital to the well-being and prosperity of the people of this state; that there are major issues of public
7 health and safety and impact upon the environment related to the technologies and energy sources
8 used in some facilities; that some energy facilities require a major commitment of funds and
9 resources and require many years to build that the decision to permit or deny their construction will
10 have long term impact on the economy of the state; that these decisions will affect the availability
11 and cost of the energy; and that the evaluation of proposals must recognize and consider the need
12 for these facilities in relation to the overall impact of the facilities upon public health and safety,
13 the environment and the economy of the state;
14 (b) The general assembly further finds that the authority to regulate many aspects of the
15 issues involved in the siting of major energy facilities currently exists in a variety of agencies within
16 the government of the state and the political subdivisions of the state; that there is overlapping
17 jurisdiction among several state agencies in the siting of energy facilities; and that there is the
18 potential for conflicting decisions being issued by the various agencies having authority over the

1 different aspects of the siting of a major energy facility;
2 (c) The jurisdiction of each state agency should be defined, and the role of each agency in
3 energy siting should be delineated, to eliminate overlap and duplication and to insure that
4 expeditious decisions are made within a time frame to be determined by law; and that in addition
5 to the existing regulation, statewide and regional planning for energy resources and the assessment
6 of our state’s need for energy should be on-going activities within Rhode Island;
7 (d) There is need for a coordinated decision on any major energy facility; the technical
8 expertise for this evaluation is available within existing agencies involved with the siting process;
9 and
10 (e) There is a need for coordinating and expediting the review of each state agency and that
11 the authority and responsibility to perform that function should be established.; and
12 (f) The general assembly recognizes that a host community for a proposed or existing major
13 generating facility is uniquely affected by the energy facility siting process.
14 42-98-2. Declaration of policy.
15 It shall be the policy of this state to assure that:
16 (1) The facilities required to meet the energy needs of this and succeeding generations of
17 Rhode Islanders are planned for, considered, and built in a timely and orderly fashion;
18 (2) Construction, operation, and/or alteration of major energy facilities shall only be
19 undertaken when those actions are justified by long term state and/or regional energy need
20 forecasts;
21 (3) The energy shall be produced at the least possible cost to the consumer consistent with
22 the objective of ensuring that the construction, operation, and decommissioning of the facility shall
23 produce the fewest possible adverse effects on the quality of the state’s environment; most
24 particularly, its land and its wildlife and resources, the health and safety of its citizens, the purity
25 of its air and water, its aquatic and marine life, and its esthetic and recreational value to the public;
26 (4) The licensure and regulatory authority of the state be consolidated in a single body,
27 which will render the final licensing decision concerning the siting, construction, operation, and/or
28 alteration of major energy facilities;
29 (5) An energy facility planning process shall be created through which the statewide
30 planning program, in conjunction with the division of public utilities and carriers, will be
31 empowered to undertake evaluations and projections of long and short term energy needs, and any
32 other matters that are necessary to establish the state energy plans, goals, and policies. The state
33 planning council shall be authorized and empowered to adopt a long term plan assessing the state’s
34 future energy needs and the best strategy for meeting them, as part of the state guide plan by January
LC000344 - Page 2 of 15

1 1, 1991.
2 (6) The construction, operation, and/or alteration of major energy facilities shall be
3 consistent with the state’s established energy plans, goals, and policy.
4 (7) Before approving the construction, operation, and/or alteration of major energy
5 facilities, the board shall determine whether cost-effective efficiency and conservation
6 opportunities provide an appropriate alternative to the proposed facility.
7 (8) The energy facilities siting board shall give priority to energy generation projects based
8 on the degree to which such projects meet criteria including, but not limited to:
9 (i) Using renewable fuels, or natural gas, or coal processed by “clean coal technology” as
10 their primary fuel;
11 (ii) Maximizing efficiency;
12 (iii) Using low levels of high-quality water;
13 (iv) Using existing energy-generation facilities and sites;
14 (v) Producing low levels of potentially harmful air emissions;
15 (vi) Producing low levels of wastewater discharge;
16 (vii) Producing low levels of waste into the solid waste stream; and
17 (viii) Having dual fuel capacity.

14 42-98-11. Final hearing — Standards — Decisions.
15 (a) Within forty-five (45) days after the final date for submission of advisory opinions
16 pursuant to § 42-98-10, the board shall convene the final hearing on the application. The purpose
17 of this the final hearing shall not be to rehear the evidence which was presented previously in
18 hearings before agencies designated under § 42-98-9, but rather to provide the applicant,
19 intervenors, the public, and all other parties in the proceeding, the opportunity to address in a single
20 forum, and from a consolidated, statewide prospective, the issues reviewed, and the
21 recommendations made in the proceedings before the agencies designated under § 42-98-9. The
22 board at this hearing may, at its discretion, allow the presentation of new evidence by any party as
23 to the issues considered by the agencies designated under § 42-98-9. The board may limit the
24 presentation of repetitive or cumulative evidence. The final hearing shall proceed on not less than
25 thirty (30) days’ notice to the parties and the public, shall be concluded not more than sixty (60)
26 days following its initiation, and shall be conducted expeditiously.
27 (b) The board shall issue a decision granting a license only upon finding that the applicant
28 has shown that:
29 (1) Construction of the proposed facility is necessary to meet the needs of the state and/or
30 region for energy of the type to be produced by the proposed facility.
31 (2) The proposed facility is cost-justified, and can be expected to produce energy at the
32 lowest reasonable cost to the consumer consistent with the objective of ensuring that the
33 construction and operation of the proposed facility will be accomplished in compliance with all of
34 the requirements of the laws, rules, regulations, and ordinances, under which, absent this chapter,
LC000344 - Page 11 of 15

1 a permit, license, variance, or assent would be required, or that consideration of the public health,
2 safety, welfare, security and need for the proposed facility justifies a waiver of some part of the
3 requirements when compliance cannot be assured.
4 (3) The proposed facility will not cause unacceptable harm to the environment and will
