LC002312 - Page 13 of 31

1 to comply with those provisions of the "Open Meetings" law (chapter 42-46) which provides for

5 session but no other votes shall be permitted in executive sessions. The chair of the committee
6 which may be called into executive session shall provide a general description to the public of the
7 reason for calling such committee into executive session.

11 of the public hearing shall be to solicit the comments of the public on the matter being
12 considered. At the public hearing all persons shall be permitted to testify; provided, however, the
13 committee chair may limit the amount of time allotted to speakers except that the prime sponsor
14 shall not have a time limit to speak and shall upon request be the first speaker at the hearing.
15 After the public hearing has been held for a reasonable period and if there are still persons
16 wishing to speak, the committee chair may continue the hearing until another date.
17 6.5 Hearing and Consideration of Bills.
18 Upon a written request by the prime sponsor of any public bill received by the secretary
19 of the senate before the closing of the next legislative day after the deadline for introduction as
20 specified in section 4.5 that a committee hearing be held with respect to such bill, the committee
21 chair shall schedule a committee hearing within eight (8) legislative days of such request unless a
22 later date is agreed to by the prime sponsor. "Received" as used herein shall mean receipt in hand
23 by the secretary of the senate or his or her designee. The secretary shall note the date and time of
24 receipt on the request and such notation shall be dispositive. On the same day, the sponsor shall
25 hand deliver copies of the request to the president of the senate and to the committee chair or their
26 designees. The committee shall consider said bill not more than eight (8) legislative days after the
27 committee hearing, unless a later date is agreed to by the prime sponsor. If the committee does
28 not consider the bill then the committee shall be discharged of its responsibility to consider such
29 bill and such bill shall be placed on the senate calendar pursuant to section 7.6 hereof.
30 Consideration by a committee shall mean any one of the following actions: recommendation of
31 passage, recommendation of passage as amended, transfer to another committee, indefinite
32 postponement, hold for further study or defeat of the bill. Provided further, the minority leader
33 may request in writing within twenty-four (24) hours after the deadline for introductions specified
34 in section 4.5 a hearing on any senate bill in committee. In the event a request is made pursuant to
LC002312 - Page 14 of 31

1 this rule at a time less than sixteen (16) days before the deadline for committee consideration set
2 forth in section 6.9, then such request shall not be proper and shall be automatically denied.
3 6.6 Quorum.
4 A committee shall not vote upon any bill in the absence of a quorum which shall consist
5 of a majority of the committee's members; provided, however, that at the discretion of the chair,
6 less than a quorum may conduct any hearing including public hearings.
7 6.7 Minority Representation.
8 When there is no minority member present and the committee is to consider a bill, the
9 committee chair shall notify the office of the minority leader. Unless waived by the minority
10 leader, the committee shall not conduct business for a reasonable time not to exceed fifteen (15)
11 minutes or until a minority member of the committee is present. Once a minority member is
12 present, his or her subsequent absence will not require further notice to the minority leader. For
13 purposes of this rule, an independent senator shall be considered to be a minority member.
14 6.8 Committee Votes.
15 All votes in committee on public bills shall be a recorded roll call vote. The vote upon all
16 motions or bills not considered a "public bill" shall, upon the request of any member of the
17 committee, be a recorded roll call vote. Otherwise all votes shall be put by yeas and nays.
18 Committee chairs shall submit all bills approved by committee to the floor forthwith, with a
19 record of the committee vote.
20 6.9 Deadline for Consideration.

22 consider only those public bills which have been acted upon and transmitted to the senate by the

24 committee to immediately consider a senate bill then in committee and said bill shall be
25 considered by the committee.
26 6.10 Discharge from Committee.
27 No bill shall be taken or called from any such committee, or the committee discharged
28 from the consideration thereof, except:
29 Any senator may present a petition, in writing, to discharge a committee from further
30 consideration of a bill which has been in the possession of the committee for thirty (30)
31 legislative days without having been considered, but only one petition on a particular bill may be
32 presented during the course of a session. Prior to presenting the petition, the senator must
33 introduce a resolution of intent to discharge such committee. Such resolution of intent shall
34 contain the bill number and the committee to be discharged. The presiding officer shall cause the
LC002312 - Page 15 of 31

1 resolution of intent to be printed in the journal of the senate. The petition shall be placed in the
2 custody of the secretary of the senate who shall arrange some convenient place for the signatures
3 of the senators to be placed thereon in the presence of the reading clerk during the hours in which
4 the senate is in session. A signature may be withdrawn by a senator at any time before the petition
5 shall become effective.
6 On the first day of each week, there shall be printed in the journal of the senate the
7 petitions pending under these rules, together with the signatures thereto; provided, however, that
8 as soon as a majority of all the senators elected to the senate shall have affixed their signatures to
9 any such petition to discharge a committee under this rule, the presiding officer shall cause notice
10 thereof to be given to chair and clerk of the committee to which such bill was referred, and such
11 notice shall, thereupon, automatically discharge the committee from further consideration of the
12 bill and the bill shall be placed upon the calendar in accordance with section 7.6 hereof.
13 Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to change the deadline for
14 consideration as specified in section 6.9.
15 6.11 Compelling Committee Action.
16 If a committee to which a bill has been referred fails to consider such bill within sixteen
17 (16) legislative days of its referral, the prime sponsor of such bill, or a majority of the appointed
18 members, but not less than four (4) committee members, may, in writing, request the chair of the
19 committee, through the presiding officer of the senate, that such bill be considered. The request
20 shall be printed in the journal of the senate. The committee shall consider such bill at its first
21 meeting held at least three (3) legislative days after such request is made. If the committee does
22 not consider the bill within nine (9) legislative days of receipt of the request then the committee
23 shall be discharged of its responsibility to consider such bill and such bill shall be placed on the
24 senate calendar pursuant to section 7.6 hereof. Consideration by a committee shall be interpreted
25 to mean any one of the following actions: recommendation of passage, recommendation of
26 passage as amended, transfer to another committee, indefinite postponement, hold for further
27 study or defeat of the bill. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to change the
28 deadline for consideration as specified in section 6.9.
29 6.12 Defeat of a Bill.
30 Once a bill is defeated in committee, the same shall not be acted upon or considered
31 again during the same legislative year.
32 6.13 Indefinite Postponement.
33 Whenever any bill is postponed indefinitely in committee, the same shall not be acted
34 upon or considered again during the same legislative year.
LC002312 - Page 16 of 31

1 6.14 Transfer of Bills.
2 In the event the chair of any standing committee determines that any bill then pending
3 before the committee would more properly be pending before another standing committee of the
4 senate, the chair shall transfer such bill to such other standing committee as is deemed appropriate
5 during the reports of committees.
6 6.15 Committee Records.
7 All recorded votes of committees, all written testimony submitted to a committee, and the
8 transcripts of any recorded testimony shall be retained by the clerk of each committee, shall
9 constitute public records, and shall be available for inspection to any senator and to any person
10 upon request. Written testimony relating to legislation shall be published online. All committee
11 votes, transcripts and testimony shall be transmitted to the secretary of state pursuant to state law
12 and senate policy following final adjournment in even numbered years.
13 6.16 Attribution of Bills.
14 Upon presentation of testimony before a committee, the prime sponsor of the bill shall
15 provide to the committee the name of any individual, group or organization responsible for the
16 substantive basis or text of the bill.
17 6.17 Companion Bills.
18 Any house bill, identical to a senate bill previously heard in committee, may be
19 considered without further hearing.
20 6.18 Substitute Bills.
21 Any proposed substitute bill, or a substitute of a bill held by a committee, shall be posted
22 at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to consideration. Such postings will be placed on the official
23 general assembly website, as well as on the legislative data bulletin board and on a bulletin or
24 electronic board of which shall be for the public's use and shall be situated at the main entrance to
25 the state library. The electronic posting shall be considered the official date of the posting. In the
26 event that the electronic posting is inoperable, then the official posting shall be the legislative data
27 bulletin board. The chair may waive this twenty-four (24) hour posting requirement, for
28 amendments technical, grammatical, or not substantive or substantial in nature. This section shall
29 not apply to the annual state budget bill.

17 appears in the press or other public medium but shall not include the right to discuss favorable
18 references to the senator, nor to reply to generalized criticism of the senate which does not refer
19 to him or to her specifically, nor to attack another member of the senate personally. Whether a
20 member's remarks constitute personal privilege shall be determined by the presiding officer.
21 7.3 Addressing the Senate on Important Matters.
22 Only at the time provided for in section 3.3, a senator may request unanimous consent of
23 the senators present to address the senate on a topic or matter of importance to the welfare of the

4 committee unless otherwise ordered by the president of the senate in agreement with the majority
5 leader and the minority leader. Such calendar shall be electronically available to all members of

9 All business on the calendar not disposed of at the time of adjournment shall be first in
10 order on the calendar the next day. No matter of business on the calendar shall be considered
11 upon its merits unless it has been on such calendar for at least two (2) calendar days; except that
12 the president of the senate may order a bill placed on the calendar for less than two (2) calendar
13 days; provided, however, a bill passed by the senate and amended by the house of representatives
14 may be considered by the senate without being on the calendar for two (2) calendar days if the
15 requirements of section 4.9-1 have been met.
16 7.7 Consent Calendar.

29 joint committee on the part of the senate, if in attendance on the general assembly, shall not have
30 been notified or present when the subject was acted on by such joint committee. No report shall
31 be acted on in the senate from any joint committee unless as subscribed by a senator who is a
32 member of said committee. Any report from a joint committee shall be made on the floor of the
33 senate by a member of said committee, notwithstanding that said member may not have
34 concurred in the report and said report shall be held on the desk unless ordered placed on the
LC002312 - Page 19 of 31

5 transmittals received on that day. The president of the senate shall assign house transmittals to
6 committees upon adjournment of the senate. The secretary of the senate shall cause all house
7 transmittals to be published in the senate journal for the day such transmittals are received. Any
8 senator may object to the committee assignment for any transmittal received during the previous
9 legislative day. Upon objection being made, the presiding officer shall assign the transmittal to
10 the committee requested by the senator making the objection, provided, however, that if another
11 senator objects to any assignment or proposed assignment of the transmittal, then the presiding
12 officer shall call for a vote of the senate on any motion for assignment which has been made and
13 seconded, such motion requiring a majority vote of those senators present and voting for
14 assignment to a particular committee.
15 During the time for consideration of house transmittals, a senator may move for
16 immediate consideration of a house transmittal, received by the secretary of the senate on the
17 previous legislative day. If there is no objection to the motion, it is deemed to be approved, but if
18 there is objection to the motion for immediate consideration, the presiding officer shall submit the
19 motion to a vote of the senate, such motion for immediate consideration shall require the votes of
20 two-thirds (2/3) of those senators present and voting, for approval.

22 No senator may amend from the floor any bill pending before the senate unless such
23 amendment be submitted, electronically or in writing, with sufficient copies signed by the
24 proponent, and read to the body; provided, however, that no amendment to the annual budget bill
25 making appropriations for the support of the state may be offered, except with the agreement of
26 two-thirds (2/3) of the members present, unless copies thereof shall have been filed with the

13 precedence in the order in which they are here arranged and shall be decided by majority vote
14 without debate; provided further that a motion to recommit as to any bill which is placed on the
15 senate calendar may be voted by yeas and nays; however, if the prime sponsor timely objects, the
16 motion shall be voted on by electronic roll of the senate.
17 7.14 Adjournment.
18 When time for meeting of the senate shall have been previously fixed, a motion to

34 motion to reconsider is pending shall, unless otherwise ordered, remain in the possession of the
LC002312 - Page 21 of 31

11 During the time for introduction and reference of new business, as provided in section
12 3.3, a senator may introduce a bill and move for immediate consideration of the bill at that time.
13 If there is no objection to the motion, for immediate consideration it is deemed to be approved,
14 but if there is objection to the motion for immediate consideration, the presiding officer shall

16 the votes of two-thirds (2/3) of those senators present and voting, for approval. If the bill is not

18 consideration, then a hard copy of the bill shall be made available to any senator upon request.
19 7.22 Questions During Debate.
20 A senator, while speaking after recognition by the chair, may, upon request of a senator,
21 yield to him or her temporarily without thereby relinquishing his or her prior right to the floor
22 and, thereafter, may terminate such interruption and resume speaking at any time; provided,
23 however, that it shall not be in order for a senator to rise and request that a senator, other than the
24 one with the right to the floor, yield to a question. Furthermore, it shall not be in order for a
25 senator, with the right to the floor, to ask another senator to yield to a question, unless such
26 senator has previously spoken during the debate on the matter. All questions and responses shall
27 be directed through the chair and the presiding officer shall not be interrupted when speaking.

2 In the event the machine is not to be used to record a vote or is not operating properly, all
3 votes and other determinations may be taken as required by senate rules, either by voice vote,
4 division vote or by calling the roll alphabetically and recording the yeas and nays. If a senator's
5 voting device is out of order, the senator shall rise and announce it to the presiding officer and
6 cast his or her vote orally prior to the declaration of the result of the vote.
7 8.3 Who May Vote.
8 Any member who is present on the senate floor must vote. Any senator who is not on the
9 floor at such time, but who returns before the machine is locked, shall be permitted to vote.
10 Without objection or with a majority vote, a senator may be permitted to cast a vote after the

12 legislative day and, only if the vote if so permitted, will not change the result previously
13 announced.

17 8.5 Conducting a Vote.
18 At a reasonable time prior to any vote being taken, the presiding officer shall announce
19 that a vote is about to be taken. When any senator other than the president of the senate is
20 presiding, such senator may direct either the Secretary of the Senate or the reading clerk to cast
21 his or her vote at his or her voting station, but at no other time may a senator designate any other
22 person to cast his or her vote. Until the completion of the voting, no senator shall be recognized,
23 and no other business shall be transacted. When sufficient time has elapsed for each senator to
24 vote prior to locking the machine, the presiding officer shall ask if any member present desires to
25 vote or change his or her vote. The presiding officer shall then order the machine locked and
26 activate the recording process. The voting machine shall remain locked between all votes.
27 8.6 Announcing the Tally.
28 When the vote is completely recorded, the Secretary of the Senate shall advise the
29 presiding officer of the result; and the presiding officer shall announce the result to the senate and
30 the result shall be recorded in the journal.
31 8.7 Changing a Vote.
32 No vote may be changed after the system has been locked and the vote recorded except
33 that, after a vote has been recorded, any senator may, by a majority vote of the senate, be
34 permitted to change his or her vote, provided that such change be effected on the same calendar
LC002312 - Page 23 of 31

1 day as his or her original vote.
2 8.8 Recording Votes.
3 8.8-1 On any recorded vote, no senator shall be recorded as having voted unless he or she
4 has been recorded or recognized as being present prior to the conduct of said vote.
5 8.8-2 Upon request, on any non-recorded vote, any senator shall have his or her vote
6 recorded so that it shall appear in the journal of the senate.
7 8.9 Voting for Another.
8 No senator may vote for another senator; nor may any person cast a vote for a senator,
9 except as otherwise provided in section 8.5. A senator who voted for another senator may be
10 punished in a manner the senate determines. A person voting for a senator, when not authorized
11 by section 8.5, is barred from the floor of the senate and may be further punished as the senate
12 determines.
13 8.10 Explanation of Vote.
14 No explanation of any vote will be permitted during the voting or after a vote has been
15 cast.
16 8.11 Statement of the Question.
17 After the question has been put, but before the system is locked, any senator may call for
18 a statement of the question.
19 8.12 No Interruption.
20 While the presiding officer is putting the question, or the vote is being recorded, no
21 senator shall speak or leave his or her place.
22 8.13 Voting by Proxy.
23 Notwithstanding any senate rule to the contrary, during any declared state of emergency
24 and while the senate is in session, a senator may request from the presiding officer permission to
