18 percent (60%) of the floor area of the principal dwelling, whichever is less; and
19 (ii) A two-bedroom (2) ADU of at least twelve hundred square feet (1,200 sq. ft.), or sixty

1 percent (60%) of the floor area of the principal dwelling, whichever is less.
2 (2) For all ADU applications, a municipality shall not:

9 improvements and/or modifications are required by an applicable state agency for compliance

15 (vi) Require additional lot area, lot frontage, or lot width for conforming lots or legal
16 nonconforming lots of record solely to accommodate an ADU;
17 (vii) Require zoning relief for ADU applications proposed within an existing footprint of

33 or subdivisions. For proposed ADUs that are part of a larger development proposal, a municipality
34 shall not count such ADUs toward density of the proposal for purposes of limiting the number of

1 dwelling units allowed in such development proposal.
2 (i) Municipalities may utilize a unified development review process for any application

6 utility assessment and/or tie in fees.

12 deemed in compliance with this subsection.

17 platform, as such terms are defined in § 42-63.1-2.
18 (c)(1) Notwithstanding any provisions in subsections (a) or (b) of this section, or in §§ 45-
19 24-31 or 45-24-37, to the contrary, effective July l, 2025, a municipality may, through regulation
