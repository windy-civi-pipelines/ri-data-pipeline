Introduced By: Representatives Felix, Shekarchi, Blazejewski, Chippendale, Paplauskas,

Date Introduced: March 27, 2025
Referred To: House read and passed
1 WHEREAS, The Community College of Rhode Island Lady Knights Basketball Team,
2 led by the sterling coaching provided by Hall of Fame CCRI Alumnus Head Coach, Doug
3 Haynes, continued their four-year run and dominant play on the court as they compiled an
4 outstanding overall record of 24-6, and a perfect 13-0 record in conference play; and
5 WHEREAS, For the fourth year in a row, the Lady Knights Basketball Team won the
6 National Junior College Athletic Association Region XXI Conference and earned a berth in the
7 2025 NJCAA Division III National Tournament. Tracing back to the 2001-2002 season, the
8 women's team has won an unprecedented 50 consecutive games against Region XXI Conference
9 Schools, one of the most impressive achievements in the history of college sports; and
10 WHEREAS, In the Region XXI Tournament, the Lady Knights held the first seed, and
11 showed why they were a force to be reckoned with in the first round when they dominated their
12 opponent, Northern Essex Community College with a score of 94-52, to advance to the
13 championship game. In the title game, the Lady Knights once again excelled under pressure,
14 defeating UConn Avery Point 75-59 to secure an invitation to the 2025 NJCAA Division III
15 National Tournament where they finished their season strong, after dropping the first game, by
16 defeating Owens Community College in the consolation game; and
17 WHEREAS, Being a championship team requires that every member of the team gives
18 their all at all times and always places team needs ahead of individual aspirations. The Lady

1 Knights had those attributes in abundance all season as they were led by the outstanding play
2 provided by star player Stephanie Walker of Providence, who led the team in scoring and
3 rebounding, Angelisse Melendez of North Providence, who broke the school record of all-time
4 three-pointers made with 158, including 8 points scored in the Regional Semifinal, and Tatiana
5 Pereira, who led the Lady Knights with 27 points scored in the Regional Final. Other team
6 members include Jayanah Rollins, Kellylyn Kozlin, Sydney Waitekus, Javâ€™Viona Smith-
7 Littlejohn, Kelsey Hatch, Pamela Galva, Rihanna Tavares, Trinity Burk and Nadine Ogni; and
8 WHEREAS, The Lady Knights also benefitted all season by the outstanding leadership
9 and guidance that was provided by Head Coach, Doug Haynes and Assistant Coaches, Victoria
10 Wilkerson, Derrick Campbell, and Katherine Raposo; now, therefore be it
11 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
12 heartily congratulates the Community College of Rhode Island Women's Basketball Team on
13 winning the National Junior College Athletic Association Region XXI Conference for the fourth
14 year in a row and earning a berth in the 2025 NJCAA Division III National Tournament; and be it
15 further
16 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
17 transmit a duly certified copy of this resolution to the CCRI Women's Basketball Team Head
18 Coach, Doug Haynes.
