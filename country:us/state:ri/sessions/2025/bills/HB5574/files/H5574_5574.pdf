9 transmitting electric, cable, television or other telecommunications service.
10 (4) "Public utility" means and applies to every corporation, company, person, association
11 of persons, their lessees, trustees, or receivers appointed to any court whatsoever, that now or
12 hereafter may own, lease, operate, manage or control any electric plant or equipment or any part of
13 any electric plant or equipment, within this state, for the production, transmission, delivery or

15 (b) The owner of a double utility pole shall notify all other users of the utility pole of the
16 starting date of such removal and installation work at least seventy-two (72) hours prior to the
17 commencement of such work. Said owner may impose a penalty upon the user who has not
18 removed their wiring and other attachments/plants when said failure to remove is responsible for

1 the immediate delay in the removal of the existing pole. No penalty shall be imposed when the
2 failure of a city or town to remove its police or fire alarm circuits or any similar municipal
3 equipment is the cause of the immediate delay and no other work could be performed.
4 (c) An electric distribution company or telephone company engaging in the removal of an
