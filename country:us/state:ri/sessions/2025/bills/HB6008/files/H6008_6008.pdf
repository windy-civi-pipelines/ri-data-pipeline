2 Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 and the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of

4 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of §§ 44-30-1 and 44-30-2, for tax years beginning on
5 or after January 1, 2001, a Rhode Island personal income tax is imposed upon the Rhode Island
6 taxable income of residents and nonresidents, including estates and trusts, at the rate of twenty-five

8 and thereafter of the federal income tax rates, including capital gains rates and any other special

22 2001, and twenty-five percent (25%) for tax year 2002 and thereafter, and comparing the product
23 to the Rhode Island tax as computed otherwise under this section. The excess shall be the taxpayer’s
24 Rhode Island alternative minimum tax.
25 (1) For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2005, and thereafter, the exemption
26 amount for alternative minimum tax, for Rhode Island purposes, shall be adjusted for inflation by
27 the tax administrator in the manner prescribed for adjustment by the commissioner of Internal
28 Revenue in 26 U.S.C. § 1(f).
29 (2) For the period January 1, 2007, through December 31, 2007, and thereafter, Rhode
30 Island taxable income shall be determined by deducting from federal adjusted gross income as

33 federal tax return for the purposes of claiming a personal exemption(s), then the Taxpayer
34 Identification Number must be provided on the Rhode Island tax return for the purpose of claiming
LC001550 - Page 14 of 18

3 purposes pursuant to § 44-30-12, for the taxable year exceeds one hundred seventy-five thousand
4 dollars ($175,000), the exemption amount shall be reduced by the applicable percentage. The term
5 “applicable percentage” means twenty (20) percentage points for each five thousand dollars
6 ($5,000) (or fraction thereof) by which the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income for the taxable year
7 exceeds one hundred seventy-five thousand dollars ($175,000).

12 and 44-30-2.6(c)(3)(C) adjusted for inflation using a base tax year of 2000, multiplied by;
13 (II) The cost-of-living adjustment with a base year of 2000.
14 (III) For the purposes of this section, the cost-of-living adjustment for any calendar year is
15 the percentage (if any) by which the consumer price index for the preceding calendar year exceeds
16 the consumer price index for the base year. The consumer price index for any calendar year is the
17 average of the consumer price index as of the close of the twelve-month (12) period ending on
18 August 31, of such calendar year.
19 (IV) For the purpose of this section the term “consumer price index” means the last
20 consumer price index for all urban consumers published by the department of labor. For the purpose
21 of this section the revision of the consumer price index that is most consistent with the consumer
22 price index for calendar year 1986 shall be used.
23 (V) If any increase determined under this section is not a multiple of fifty dollars ($50.00),
24 such increase shall be rounded to the next lower multiple of fifty dollars ($50.00). In the case of a
25 married individual filing separate return, if any increase determined under this section is not a
26 multiple of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), such increase shall be rounded to the next lower multiple
27 of twenty-five dollars ($25.00).
