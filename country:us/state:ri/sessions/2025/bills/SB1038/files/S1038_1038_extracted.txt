1 impact on the environmental justice focus area of the proposed permitted activity;

16 representative of the environmental justice focus area. At the public hearing, the permit applicant
17 shall provide clear, accurate, and complete information about the proposed permitted activity and

25 Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, or rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto to
26 the contrary, the department or council may deny a permit application in an environmental justice
27 focus area upon a finding that the approval of the permit would, together with the cumulative
28 impacts posed by the existing conditions, including conditions resulting from already permitted
29 activities, in the environmental justice focus area, constitute an unreasonable risk to the health of
30 the residents of the environmental justice focus area or to the environment in the environmental
31 justice focus area.
32 (c) The department or council, when evaluating an application for a permit pursuant to this
33 section, shall assess the community support for the proposed permitted activity, as demonstrated

1 for, or opposition to, the proposed permitted activity, and any ordinance or resolution adopted by
2 the governing body of the municipality in which the environmental justice focus area is located.
3 Community support or opposition alone shall be insufficient grounds on which to approve or deny
4 a permit, though the department shall respond to any claim made by members of the public, their
5 representatives, and/or their experts that the proposed permit is inconsistent with an applicable law,
6 rule or regulation.
7 (d) If a permit applicant is applying for more than one permit for a proposed permitted
8 activity, the permit applicant shall only be required to comply with the provisions of this section
9 once for the same facility in the same location, unless the department, in its discretion, determines
10 that more than one public hearing is necessary due to the complexity of the proposed permitted
11 activity. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of the department to hold
12 or require additional public hearings.
13 42-17.11-5. Implementation.
14 (a) The department and council shall adopt rules and regulations to implement the
15 provisions of this chapter.
16 (b) The department may issue guidance on how to evaluate cumulative impacts pursuant
17 to § 42-17.11-4(a)(1). The department shall publish the guidance document on its website.
18 SECTION 2. This act shall take effect upon passage.
