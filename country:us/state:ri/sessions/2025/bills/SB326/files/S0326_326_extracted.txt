SUPERFUND ACT OF 2025
Introduced By: Senators Ujifusa, Euer, Bell, Kallman, Valverde, Gu, Britto, DiMario,
Mack, and Sosnowski
Date Introduced: February 21, 2025
Referred To: Senate Environment & Agriculture
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. The general assembly hereby finds and declares all of the following:
2 (1) Climate change caused by the combustion of fossil fuels is an immediate and grave
3 threat to the people, environment, natural resources, and economy of the state.
4 (2) Rising sea levels and temperatures, extreme weather events, flooding, heat waves,
5 droughts, and other climate change effects have harmed or killed countless humans and other living
6 organisms.
7 (3) As a state with over four hundred (400) miles of coastline and an economy dependent
8 on tourism and marine trades, Rhode Island is especially vulnerable to economic and social harms
9 from climate change.
10 (4) All Rhode Islanders are adversely affected by climate change, but harms fall
11 disproportionately on seniors, children, low-income and minority communities.
12 (5) The state and municipalities have developed and implemented plans to counteract,
13 mitigate and prevent the adverse effects of climate change and must continue to do so to protect
14 the health and safety of Rhode Islanders.
15 (6) The costs of such plans and implementation have fallen and will continue to fall almost
16 exclusively on taxpayers.
17 (7) Laws must be passed to require contributions by those who most contributed to and
18 profited from causing climate change and who did so knowingly. These responsible parties are
1 large fossil fuel corporations.
2 (8) Fair shares from these corporations can be accurately determined by analyzing the
3 amounts of “greenhouse gas,” such as, but not limited to, carbon dioxide and methane, each
4 contributed to the environment.
5 (9) Chapter 6.3 of title 42 shall help the state and municipalities make polluters pay and
6 support other private and public efforts to hold them responsible.
7 SECTION 2. Title 42 of the General Laws entitled "STATE AFFAIRS AND
8 GOVERNMENT" is hereby amended by adding thereto the following chapter:
