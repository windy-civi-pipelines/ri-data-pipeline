It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Sections 27-18.2-3 and 27-18.2-3.1 of the General Laws in Chapter 27-18.2
2 entitled "Medicare Supplement Insurance Policies" are hereby amended to read as follows:
3 27-18.2-3. Standards for policy provisions.
4 (a) No Medicare supplement insurance policy or certificate in force in the state shall contain
5 benefits that duplicate benefits provided by Medicare.
6 (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law of this state, a Medicare supplement policy
7 or certificate shall not exclude or limit benefits for loss incurred more than six (6) months from the
8 effective date of coverage because it involved a preexisting condition. The policy or certificate shall
9 not define a preexisting condition more restrictively than a condition for which medical advice was
10 given or treatment was recommended by or received from a physician within six (6) months before
11 the effective date of coverage.
12 (c) The commissioner shall adopt reasonable regulations to establish specific standards for
13 policy provisions of Medicare supplement policies and certificates. Those standards shall be in
14 addition to and in accordance with the applicable laws of this state, including but not limited to §§
15 27-18-3(a) and 42-62-12 and regulations promulgated pursuant to those sections. No requirement
16 of this title or chapter 62 of title 42 relating to minimum required policy benefits, other than the

8 (9) Definitions of terms.
9 (d) The commissioner may adopt reasonable regulations that specify prohibited policy
10 provisions not specifically authorized by statute, if, in the opinion of the commissioner, those
11 provisions are unjust, unfair, or unfairly discriminatory to any person insured or proposed to be
12 insured under a Medicare supplement policy or certificate.
13 (e) The commissioner shall adopt reasonable regulations to establish minimum standards
14 for premium rates, benefits, claims payment, marketing practices, and compensation arrangements
15 and reporting practices for Medicare supplement policies and certificates.

23 Medicare supplement insurance;
24 (4) Establishing a process for approving or disapproving policy forms and certificate forms
25 and proposed premium increases;

4 underwriting on any applicant in connection with the issuance of a policy pursuant to this
5 subsection.
6 (1) Any individual under the age of sixty-five (65) enrolled in a Medicare supplement Plan

23 supplement policy or Medicare Advantage plan who has been covered by any Medicare supplement
24 policy(s) or Medicare Advantage plan(s) with no gap in coverage greater than ninety (90) days
25 beginning from that individual's Medicare Initial Enrollment Period (IEP), shall be afforded
26 guaranteed issue rights for any available Medicare supplement policy or applicable certificate that
27 an issuer currently makes available in this state.

7 commissioner.
8 (b) The commissioner shall review the rate, rating formula, or rate manual filing and

11 and as authorized by law.
12 (1) For any rate filing subject to a public comment period, as determined by the
