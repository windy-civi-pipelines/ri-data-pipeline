12 (3) This chapter does not alter or limit the director’s authority to administer the self-
13 directed supports program, enforce existing rules, regulations and procedures or adopt amended
14 rules, regulations and procedures for operating the program, determine a participant’s Medicaid
15 eligibility and appropriateness for self-directed personal care services, or assess the scope, amount
16 and duration of services authorized to meet a participant’s needs, except as specifically set forth in
17 this chapter.
18 (4) This chapter does not alter or limit the rights of participants and their representatives to

1 select, direct, and terminate the services of self-directed direct support professionals or to determine
2 the wages of self-directed direct support professionals within a range set by the director.
