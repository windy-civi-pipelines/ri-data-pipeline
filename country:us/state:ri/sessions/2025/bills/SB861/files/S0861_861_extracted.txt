5 receiver shall convene the group within thirty (30) days of the board designating a district as
6 chronically underperforming and the group shall make its recommendations to the commissioner
7 and receiver within forty-five (45) days of its initial meetings. Meetings of the local stakeholder
8 group shall be open to the public and the recommendations submitted to the commissioner and
9 receiver shall be publicly available immediately upon their submission.

LC001467 - Page 6 of 10
1 bargaining agreement applicable to the administrators, teachers, principals and staff, the
2 commissioner may request that the school committee and any union bargain or reopen the
3 bargaining of the relevant collective bargaining agreements to facilitate such achievement. The

7 parties are unable to reach an agreement within thirty (30) days or if the agreement is not ratified
8 within ten (10) business days by the bargaining unit members of the school, the parties shall submit
9 remaining unresolved issues to a joint resolution committee for dispute resolution process on the
10 next business day following the end of the thirty (30) day bargaining period or failure to ratify. The
11 joint resolution committee shall be comprised of three (3) members, one of whom shall be
12 appointed by the employee organization within three (3) business days following the submission
13 of unresolved issues to the joint resolution committee, one of whom shall be appointed by the board
14 of regents within three (3) business days following the submission of unresolved issues to the joint
15 resolution committee and one who shall be selected through the American Arbitration Association
16 who shall forthwith forward to the parties a list of three (3) conciliators, each of whom shall have
17 professional experience in elementary and secondary education, from which the parties may agree
18 upon a single conciliator; provided, however, that if the parties cannot select a conciliator from
19 among the three (3) within three (3) business days, the American Arbitration Association shall
20 select a conciliator from the remaining names. The joint resolution committee shall conduct a
21 dispute resolution process to be concluded within ten (10) business days of selection. This process
22 shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association and
23 consistent with this section; provided however, that all members of the joint resolution committee
24 must agree to any resolution. The fee for the process shall be shared equally between the two (2)
25 parties involved. The joint resolution committee shall consider the positions of the parties, the
26 designation of the school as underperforming or chronically underperforming, the designation of
27 the district as chronically underperforming, and the needs of the students in the school.
28 Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the unanimous decision of the joint resolution
29 committee shall be dispositive of all the issues in dispute and shall be submitted to the parties within
30 ten (10) business days of the close of the hearing. Under no circumstance, shall a time extension be
31 granted beyond ten (10) business days of the close of the hearing. In the event that a unanimous
32 decision is not submitted to the parties within ten (10) business days, the commissioner shall resolve
33 all outstanding issues.
34 (i) The turnaround plan shall be authorized for a period of not more than three (3) years,
LC001467 - Page 7 of 10
1 subject to subsection (k) of this section. The commissioner and receiver may jointly develop
2 additional components of the plan and shall jointly develop annual goals for each component of the
3 plan in a manner consistent with the provisions of subsection (g) of this section. The receiver shall
4 be responsible for meeting the goals of the turnaround plan.
5 (j) The commissioner and receiver shall provide a written report to the school committee
6 on a quarterly basis to provide specific information about the progress being made on the
7 implementation of the district's turnaround plan. One of the quarterly reports shall be the annual
8 evaluation required in subsection (g) of this section.
9 (k)(1) The commissioner shall evaluate the performance of the receiver on not less than an
10 annual basis. The purpose of such evaluation shall be to assess the implementation of the
11 turnaround plan and determine whether the district has met the annual goals contained in the
12 turnaround plan. The evaluation shall be in writing and submitted to the board and the local school
13 committee no later than July 1 for the preceding school year.
14 (2) If the commissioner determines that the district has met the annual performance goals
15 stated in the turnaround plan, the evaluation shall be considered sufficient and the implementation
16 of the turnaround plan shall continue.
17 (3) If the commissioner determines that the receiver has not met one or more goals in the
18 plan and the failure to meet the goals may be corrected through reasonable modification of the plan,
19 the commissioner may amend the turnaround plan, as necessary. After assessing the
20 implementation of the turnaround plan in the district, the commissioner may amend the plan if the
21 commissioner determines that the amendment is necessary in view of subsequent changes in the
22 district that affect one or more components of the plan including, but not limited to, changes to
23 contracts, collective bargaining agreements, or school district policies, in a manner consistent with
24 the provisions of subsection (g) of this section. If the commissioner determines that the receiver
25 has substantially failed to meet multiple goals in the turnaround plan, the commissioner may
26 terminate such receiver; provided, however, that the termination shall not occur before the
27 completion of the first full school year of the receivership of the district.
28 (l) After the period of receivership, there shall be a reevaluation of a district's status under
29 this section. The board of elementary and secondary education shall adopt regulations providing
30 for:
31 (1) The removal of a designation of a district as chronically underperforming; and
32 (2) The transfer of the operation of a chronically underperforming district from an external
33 receiver to the superintendent and school committee, based on the improvement of the district. The
34 regulations shall include provisions to allow a district to retain measures adopted in a turnaround
LC001467 - Page 8 of 10
1 plan for a transitional period if, in the judgment of the commissioner, the measures would contribute
2 to the continued improvement of the district. Such regulations shall also include provisions that
3 clearly identify the conditions under which such a transitional period shall end and the powers
4 granted to the commissioner and board under this section shall cease to apply to a district previously
5 designated as chronically underperforming. At any time after a chronically underperforming district
6 has been placed in receivership, the school committee of the district may petition the commissioner
7 for a determination as to whether the turnaround plan adopted under subsection (c) of this section
8 should be modified or eliminated and whether the school district shall no longer be designated as
9 chronically underperforming. The decision of the commissioner shall be based on regulations
10 adopted by the board. A school committee may seek review by the board of elementary and
11 secondary education of an adverse determination.
12 (m) If, on the basis of the regulations adopted by the board pursuant to subsection (l) of
13 this section, a district has not improved sufficiently to remove the designation of the district as
14 chronically underperforming, the commissioner may jointly determine subsequent annual goals for
15 each component of the turnaround plan with the receiver and renew the turnaround plan for an
16 additional period of not more than three (3) years, or create a new turnaround plan, consistent with
17 the requirements of this section.
18 SECTION 2. This act shall take effect upon passage.

7 parties are unable to reach an agreement within thirty (30) days or if the agreement is not ratified
8 within ten (10) business days by the bargaining unit members of the school, the parties shall submit
9 remaining unresolved issues to a joint resolution committee for dispute resolution process on the
10 next business day following the end of the thirty (30) day bargaining period or failure to ratify. The
11 joint resolution committee shall be comprised of three (3) members, one of whom shall be
12 appointed by the employee organization within three (3) business days following the submission
13 of unresolved issues to the joint resolution committee, one of whom shall be appointed by the board
14 of regents within three (3) business days following the submission of unresolved issues to the joint
15 resolution committee and one who shall be selected through the American Arbitration Association
16 who shall forthwith forward to the parties a list of three (3) conciliators, each of whom shall have
17 professional experience in elementary and secondary education, from which the parties may agree
18 upon a single conciliator; provided, however, that if the parties cannot select a conciliator from
19 among the three (3) within three (3) business days, the American Arbitration Association shall
20 select a conciliator from the remaining names. The joint resolution committee shall conduct a
21 dispute resolution process to be concluded within ten (10) business days of selection. This process
22 shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association and
23 consistent with this section; provided however, that all members of the joint resolution committee
24 must agree to any resolution. The fee for the process shall be shared equally between the two (2)
25 parties involved. The joint resolution committee shall consider the positions of the parties, the
26 designation of the school as underperforming or chronically underperforming, the designation of
27 the district as chronically underperforming, and the needs of the students in the school.
28 Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the unanimous decision of the joint resolution
29 committee shall be dispositive of all the issues in dispute and shall be submitted to the parties within
30 ten (10) business days of the close of the hearing. Under no circumstance, shall a time extension be
31 granted beyond ten (10) business days of the close of the hearing. In the event that a unanimous
32 decision is not submitted to the parties within ten (10) business days, the commissioner shall resolve
33 all outstanding issues.
34 (i) The turnaround plan shall be authorized for a period of not more than three (3) years,
LC001467 - Page 7 of 10

1 subject to subsection (k) of this section. The commissioner and receiver may jointly develop
2 additional components of the plan and shall jointly develop annual goals for each component of the
3 plan in a manner consistent with the provisions of subsection (g) of this section. The receiver shall
4 be responsible for meeting the goals of the turnaround plan.
5 (j) The commissioner and receiver shall provide a written report to the school committee
6 on a quarterly basis to provide specific information about the progress being made on the
7 implementation of the district's turnaround plan. One of the quarterly reports shall be the annual
8 evaluation required in subsection (g) of this section.
9 (k)(1) The commissioner shall evaluate the performance of the receiver on not less than an
10 annual basis. The purpose of such evaluation shall be to assess the implementation of the
11 turnaround plan and determine whether the district has met the annual goals contained in the
12 turnaround plan. The evaluation shall be in writing and submitted to the board and the local school
13 committee no later than July 1 for the preceding school year.
14 (2) If the commissioner determines that the district has met the annual performance goals
15 stated in the turnaround plan, the evaluation shall be considered sufficient and the implementation
16 of the turnaround plan shall continue.
17 (3) If the commissioner determines that the receiver has not met one or more goals in the
18 plan and the failure to meet the goals may be corrected through reasonable modification of the plan,
19 the commissioner may amend the turnaround plan, as necessary. After assessing the
20 implementation of the turnaround plan in the district, the commissioner may amend the plan if the
21 commissioner determines that the amendment is necessary in view of subsequent changes in the
22 district that affect one or more components of the plan including, but not limited to, changes to
23 contracts, collective bargaining agreements, or school district policies, in a manner consistent with
24 the provisions of subsection (g) of this section. If the commissioner determines that the receiver
25 has substantially failed to meet multiple goals in the turnaround plan, the commissioner may
26 terminate such receiver; provided, however, that the termination shall not occur before the
27 completion of the first full school year of the receivership of the district.
28 (l) After the period of receivership, there shall be a reevaluation of a district's status under
29 this section. The board of elementary and secondary education shall adopt regulations providing
30 for:
31 (1) The removal of a designation of a district as chronically underperforming; and
32 (2) The transfer of the operation of a chronically underperforming district from an external
33 receiver to the superintendent and school committee, based on the improvement of the district. The
34 regulations shall include provisions to allow a district to retain measures adopted in a turnaround
LC001467 - Page 8 of 10

1 plan for a transitional period if, in the judgment of the commissioner, the measures would contribute
2 to the continued improvement of the district. Such regulations shall also include provisions that
3 clearly identify the conditions under which such a transitional period shall end and the powers
4 granted to the commissioner and board under this section shall cease to apply to a district previously
5 designated as chronically underperforming. At any time after a chronically underperforming district
6 has been placed in receivership, the school committee of the district may petition the commissioner
7 for a determination as to whether the turnaround plan adopted under subsection (c) of this section
8 should be modified or eliminated and whether the school district shall no longer be designated as
9 chronically underperforming. The decision of the commissioner shall be based on regulations
10 adopted by the board. A school committee may seek review by the board of elementary and
11 secondary education of an adverse determination.
12 (m) If, on the basis of the regulations adopted by the board pursuant to subsection (l) of
13 this section, a district has not improved sufficiently to remove the designation of the district as
14 chronically underperforming, the commissioner may jointly determine subsequent annual goals for
15 each component of the turnaround plan with the receiver and renew the turnaround plan for an
16 additional period of not more than three (3) years, or create a new turnaround plan, consistent with
17 the requirements of this section.
18 SECTION 2. This act shall take effect upon passage.
