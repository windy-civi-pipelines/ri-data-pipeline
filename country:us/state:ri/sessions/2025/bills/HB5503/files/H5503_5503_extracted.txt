18 34-18-7.1. Applicability to just cause evictions.
19 This section shall apply to all housing accommodations subject to just cause evictions
20 except:
21 (1) Owner-occupied premises with fewer than five (5) units;
22 (2) An individual or family who owns and manages a one to four (4) unit property that is
23 separate from their own primary residence;
24 (3) Premises sublet, or otherwise, where the sublessor seeks, in good faith, to recover
25 possession of such housing accommodation for their own personal use and occupancy;
26 (4) Premises, the possession, use or occupancy of which, is solely incidental to employment
27 and such employment is being lawfully terminated; and
28 (5) Premises otherwise subject to regulation of rents or evictions pursuant to state or federal
29 law to the extent that such state or federal law requires "good cause" for termination or non-renewal
30 of such tenancies.
31 34-18-38.3. Necessity for just cause - Removal of tenants.
32 (a) No landlord shall, by action to evict or to recover possession, by exclusion from
33 possession, by failure to renew any lease, or otherwise, remove any tenant from housing
34 accommodations covered by chapter 18 of title 34, except for good cause as set forth in subsection
LC001598 - Page 3 of 7
1 (b) of this section.
2 (b)(1) No landlord shall remove a tenant from any housing accommodation, or attempt
3 such removal or exclusion from possession, notwithstanding that the tenant has no written lease or
4 that the lease or other rental agreement has expired or otherwise terminated, except upon order of
5 a court of competent jurisdiction entered in an appropriate judicial action or proceeding in which
6 the petitioner or plaintiff has established one of the following grounds as good cause for removal
7 or eviction:
8 (i) The tenant has failed to pay rent due and owing; provided, however, that the rent due
9 and owing, or any part thereof, did not result from a rent increase which is unreasonable or imposed
10 for the purpose of circumventing the intent of this section. In determining whether all or part of the
11 rent due and owing is the result of an unreasonable rent increase, it shall be a rebuttable presumption
12 that the rent for a dwelling not protected by rent regulation is unreasonable if said rent has been
13 increased in any calendar year by a percentage exceeding either four percent (4%) or one and one-
14 half (1½) times the annual percentage change in the consumer price index for the region in which
15 the housing accommodation is located, as established the August preceding the calendar year in
16 question, whichever is greater;
17 (ii) The tenant is violating a substantial obligation of the tenancy, other than the obligation
18 to surrender possession, and has failed to cure such violation after written notice that the violation
19 cease within ten (10) days of receipt of such written notice; provided, however, that the obligation
20 of tenancy for which violation is claimed was not imposed for the purpose of circumventing the
21 intent of this section;
22 (iii) The tenant is committing or permitting a nuisance in such housing accommodation, or
23 is maliciously or by reason of negligence damaging the housing accommodation; or the tenant's
24 conduct is such as to interfere with the comfort of the landlord or other tenants or occupants of the
25 same or adjacent buildings or structures;
26 (iv) Occupancy of the housing accommodation by the tenant is in violation of or causes a
27 violation of law and the landlord is subject to civil or criminal penalties therefore; provided,
28 however, that an agency of the state or municipality having jurisdiction has issued an order
29 requiring the tenant to vacate the housing accommodation. No tenant shall be removed from
30 possession of a housing accommodation on such ground unless the court finds that the cure of the
31 violation of law requires the removal of the tenant and that the landlord did not, through neglect or
32 deliberate action or failure to act, create the condition necessitating the vacate order. In instances
33 where the landlord does not undertake to cure conditions of the housing accommodation causing
34 such violation of the law, the tenant shall have the right to pay or secure payment in a manner
LC001598 - Page 4 of 7
1 satisfactory to the court, to cure such violation; provided that, any tenant expenditures shall be
2 applied against rent to which the landlord is entitled. In instances where removal of a tenant is
3 absolutely essential to the tenant's health and safety, the removal of the tenant shall be without
4 prejudice to any leasehold interest or other right of occupancy the tenant may have and the tenant
5 shall be entitled to resume possession at such time as the dangerous conditions have been removed.
6 Nothing herein shall abrogate or otherwise limit the right of a tenant to bring an action for monetary
7 damages against the landlord to compel compliance by the landlord with all applicable state or
8 municipal laws or housing codes;
9 (v) The tenant is using or permitting the housing accommodation to be used for an illegal
10 purpose;
11 (vi) The tenant has unreasonably refused the landlord access to the housing accommodation
12 for the purpose of making necessary repairs or improvements required by law or for the purpose of
13 showing the housing accommodation to a prospective purchaser, mortgagee or other person having
14 a legitimate interest when the landlord has provided the required forty-eight (48) hours notice for
15 non-emergency repairs therein;
16 (vii) The landlord seeks in good faith to recover possession of a housing accommodation
17 located in a building containing fewer than twelve (12) units because of immediate and compelling
18 necessity for the landlord's own personal use and occupancy as the landlord's principal residence,
19 or the personal use and occupancy as principal residence of the landlord's spouse, parent, child,
20 stepchild, father-in-law or mother-in-law, when no other suitable housing accommodation in such
21 building is available. This subsection shall permit recovery of only one housing accommodation
22 per calendar year and shall not apply to a housing accommodation occupied by a tenant who is
23 sixty-two (62) years of age or older or who is a disabled person; or
24 (viii) The landlord seeks in good faith to recover possession of any or all housing
25 accommodations located in a building with less than five (5) units to personally occupy such
26 housing accommodations as the landlord's principal residence.
27 (2) A tenant required to surrender a housing accommodation by virtue of the operation of
28 subsections (b)(1)(vii) or (b)(1)(viii) of this section shall have a cause of action in any court of
29 competent jurisdiction for damages, declaratory, and injunctive relief against a landlord or
30 purchaser of the premises who makes a fraudulent statement regarding a proposed use of the
31 housing accommodation. In any action or proceeding brought pursuant to this provision, a
32 prevailing tenant shall be entitled to recovery of actual damages, and reasonable attorneys' fees.
33 (3) Nothing in this section shall abrogate or limit the tenant's right to permanently stay the
34 issuance or execution of a warrant or eviction in a summary proceeding, whether characterized as
LC001598 - Page 5 of 7
1 a nonpayment, objectionable tenancy, or holdover proceeding, the underlying basis of which is the
2 nonpayment of rent, as long as the tenant complies with the procedural requirements of this chapter.
3 34-18-38.3. Waiver of rights void.
4 Any agreement by a tenant heretofore or hereinafter entered into in a written lease or other
5 rental agreement waiving or modifying the tenant's rights as set forth in § 34-18-38.3 shall be void
6 as contrary to public policy.
7 34-18-54.1. Preservation of existing requirements of law.
8 No action shall be maintainable and no judgment of possession shall be entered for housing
9 accommodations pursuant § 34-18-38.3 unless the landlord has complied with any and all
10 applicable laws governing such action or proceeding and has complied with any and all applicable
11 laws governing notice to tenants, including, without limitation, the manner and the time of service
12 of such notice and the contents of such notice.
13 SECTION 3. This act shall take effect upon passage.
