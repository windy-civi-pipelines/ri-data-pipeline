21 or evidence sought and shall directly relate to the matters under investigation. A subpoena issued
22 that is broad in nature is not considered valid. No subpoena shall be issued for purposes of
23 harassment or for any illegitimate or improper purpose. All constitutional and statutory rights and
24 privileges which exist with respect to any subpoena issued by the inspector general, including the
25 privilege against self-incrimination, shall have the same force and effect with any and all existing
26 laws and constitutional rights.
27 (g) A subpoenaed person may object to the subpoena served upon them in advance of the
28 return date of the subpoena by a motion to quash filed in the superior court of the state of Rhode
29 Island. The filing of a motion to quash shall stay all pending subpoenas until further order of the
30 superior court. Any justice of the superior court may, upon application by the inspector general,
31 issue an order to compel the attendance of witnesses subpoenaed, and the giving of testimony under
32 oath in furtherance of any audit or investigation under this chapter in the same manner and to the
33 same extent as before the superior court. Failure to obey any order of the court with respect to a
34 subpoena may be punished by the court as contempt.

4 which govern grand jury proceedings, shall govern testimony given. Whoever violates the
5 provisions of this subsection shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than six (6) months
6 or by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000), or both. Disclosure of such testimony
7 may be made to such members of the staff of the office of inspector general as is deemed necessary
