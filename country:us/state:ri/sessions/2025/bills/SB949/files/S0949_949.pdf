1 (a) Any grand jury may, at any time during its term, submit to the presiding justice of the
2 superior court a grand jury report to be released to the public. A grand jury report may be submitted
3 only upon the concurrence of twelve (12) or more jurors and shall be signed by each juror who

5 (b) Within thirty (30) days after receiving a report of the grand jury prepared pursuant to

10 or not the respondent agrees to the public release of the response. Any proceedings pursuant to this
11 subsection shall be sealed until ordered otherwise by the superior court.
12 (c) The superior court shall examine the report and issue an order accepting and filing the
13 report, in whole or in part, including any responses that the respondent has agreed to release, as a

16 such persons in convening the grand jury;
17 (2) The report is based on facts revealed in the course of the grand jury investigation and

20 to any lawful inquiry;
21 (4) The report does not disclose the identity of a confidential informant; and
22 (5) The filing of such report as a public record does not prejudice the fair adjudication of a
23 criminal matter.

25 prejudice fair adjudication of a pending criminal matter, the superior court shall order such report
26 sealed and such report shall not be subject to release, subpoena, or public inspection during the
27 pendency of such criminal matter except upon order of the superior court.
28 (e) Failure of the superior court to accept and file as a public record a report submitted
29 under this section may be appealed by the attorney general to the supreme court. The superior
30 court’s decision to accept and file as a public record a report submitted under this section may be
31 appealed by any person or entity named in the report, to the supreme court.
32 (f) No reports shall be issued pursuant to this section after July 1, 2030.
