It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Chapter 44-5 of the General Laws entitled "Levy and Assessment of Local
2 Taxes" is hereby amended by adding thereto the following section:
3 44-5-89. South Kingstown homestead exemption.
4 (a) The town council of the town of South Kingstown is authorized to annually fix the
5 amount, if any, of a homestead exemption, with respect to assessed value, from local taxation on
6 taxable real property used for residential purposes or mixed purposes, defined as a combination of
7 residential and commercial uses, in the town of South Kingstown, and to grant homestead
8 exemptions to the owner, or owners, of residential real estate, or combination residential and
9 commercial real estate, in an amount not to exceed ten percent (10%) of the assessed value. The
10 exemption shall apply to property used exclusively for residential purposes, and improved with a
11 dwelling containing less than five (5) units, or real property used for a combination of residential
12 and commercial uses. When real property is used for mixed purposes, the percentage of the assessed
13 value shall be a prorated amount. The prorated amount shall be the percentage of square feet of the
14 parcel used for residential purposes, multiplied by the percentage of the homestead exemption. In
15 order to determine compliance with the homestead exemption as outlined in this section, the town
16 council shall provide, by resolution or ordinance, rules and regulations governing eligibility for the
17 exemption established by this section.
18 (b) In the event property granted an exemption under this section is sold or transferred
19 during the year for which the exemption is claimed, the town council of the town of South

1 Kingstown, upon approval of the town council, may provide for a proration of the homestead
2 exemption in cases where title to property passes from those not entitled to claim an exemption to
3 those who are entitled to claim an exemption.
4 SECTION 2. This act shall take effect on December 31, 2025.
