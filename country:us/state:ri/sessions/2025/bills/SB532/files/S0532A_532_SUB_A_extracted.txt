It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Section 31-25-21 of the General Laws in Chapter 31-25 entitled "Size,
2 Weight, and Load Limits" is hereby amended to read as follows:
3 31-25-21. Power to permit excess size or weight of loads.
4 (a) The department of transportation, with respect to highways under its jurisdiction, may,
5 in its discretion, upon application in writing and good cause being shown for it, approve the
6 issuance of a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle, or
7 combination of vehicles, of a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding eighty thousand pounds
8 (80,000 lbs.) or otherwise not in conformity with the provisions of chapters 1 — 27 of this title
9 upon any highway under the jurisdiction of the party granting the permit and for the maintenance
10 of which the party is responsible. Permits that have been issued for a full year shall not be required
11 to be renewed for the period of time for which payment has been made and the application and
12 other required documentation has been completed and filed. Provided, that neither the department
13 of transportation nor the local authorities may approve the issuance of permits for divisible loads
14 weighing in excess of the limits set by the director of the department of transportation by and
15 through the rules and regulations promulgated by the department of transportation entitled “rules
16 and regulations regarding overweight and oversize vehicle permits”.
17 (1) Provided, however, that for milk products, any vehicle carrying fluid milk products
18 shall be considered a load that cannot be easily dismantled or divided.
19 (b) The director of the department of transportation may enter into agreements with other
1 states, the District of Columbia, and Canadian provinces providing for the reciprocal enforcement
2 of the overweight or over-dimensional vehicle permit laws of those jurisdictions entering into the
3 agreement.
4 (c) Single trip non-divisible permit fee. A fee of forty dollars ($40.00) shall be paid to the
5 department of transportation for the issuance of each non-divisible single trip permit. Upon
6 approval of the application, the department of transportation shall provide the approved permit. The
7 driver must possess the permit and documentation as required by the permit at all times.
8 (d) Annual construction equipment blanket permit fee. An annual fee of four hundred
9 dollars ($400) paid to the department of transportation shall exempt the payor from the necessity
10 of paying single trip permit fees for non-divisible construction equipment loads, boats, or marine
11 assets of less than one hundred thirty thousand pounds (130,000 lbs.) as found in subsection (c).
12 However, payment of the fee shall not be deemed to authorize noncompliance with the rules and
13 regulations promulgated by the department of transportation entitled “rules and regulations
14 regarding overweight and oversize vehicle permits”.
15 (e) Blanket construction equipment permits may be issued, as determined by the
16 department of transportation, for intrastate movement of non-divisible construction equipment
17 loads, boats or marine assets upon payment of the fee set forth in subsection (d). If used in
18 conjunction with an annual divisible load permit, the limits and requirements of the blanket
19 construction equipment permit shall supersede the requirements of the divisible load permit. The
20 driver must possess both permits and all required documentation. The duration of the blanket permit
21 may not exceed one year. The construction equipment blanket permit load shall be limited to a
22 minimum overall length of fifty-five feet (55′), a maximum overall length of eighty feet (80′), a
23 maximum width of twelve feet four inches (12′ 4″), a maximum gross weight of one hundred thirty
24 thousand pounds (130,000 lbs.), and a maximum axle weight of twenty-five thousand pounds
25 (25,000 lbs.); provided, that the department of transportation, with respect to highways under its
26 jurisdiction, may, in its discretion and upon application and for good cause shown, approve the
27 issuance of a single trip non-divisible permit authorizing the applicant to exceed one hundred thirty
28 thousand pounds (130,000 lbs.) for non-divisible loads. A flashing amber light shall be in operation
29 above the highest point of the vehicle and shall be visible from both the front and rear of the vehicle;
30 and signs and red warning flags shall be affixed to all extremities. All blanket permits issued in
31 accordance with this section shall be effective during daylight and night-time hours for all over-
32 dimensional moves made and travel shall be allowed on state highways. The specifically described
33 vehicle must be certified originally by the manufacturer to possess the braking and carrying
34 capacity for the weight specified on the application.
LC001639/SUB A - Page 2 of 5

24 reductions in lane width such as construction zones will not be allowed. Prior to travel, blanket
25 permit holders are responsible to verify the location of construction zones and lane width
26 reductions. Locations of lane width reduction zones are available through the state department of
