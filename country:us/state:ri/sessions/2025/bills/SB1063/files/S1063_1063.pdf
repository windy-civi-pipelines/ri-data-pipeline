6 16-7.2-6. Categorical programs, state funded expenses.
7 In addition to the foundation education aid provided pursuant to § 16-7.2-3, the permanent
8 foundation education-aid program shall provide direct state funding for:
9 (a) Excess costs associated with special education students. Excess costs are defined when
10 an individual special education student’s cost shall be deemed to be “extraordinary.” Extraordinary
11 costs are those educational costs that exceed the state-approved threshold based on an amount
12 above four times the core foundation amount (total of core instruction amount plus student success
13 amount). The department of elementary and secondary education shall prorate the funds available
14 for distribution among those eligible school districts if the total approved costs for which school
15 districts are seeking reimbursement exceed the amount of funding appropriated in any fiscal year;
16 and the department of elementary and secondary education shall also collect data on those
17 educational costs that exceed the state-approved threshold based on an amount above two (2), three
18 (3), and five (5) times the core foundation amount;
19 (b) Career and technical education costs to help meet initial investment requirements
20 needed to transform existing, or create new, comprehensive, career and technical education
21 programs and career pathways in critical and emerging industries and to help offset the higher-
22 than-average costs associated with facilities, equipment maintenance and repair, and supplies
23 necessary for maintaining the quality of highly specialized programs that are a priority for the state.
24 The department shall develop criteria for the purpose of allocating any and all career and technical
25 education funds as may be determined by the general assembly on an annual basis. The department
26 of elementary and secondary education shall prorate the funds available for distribution among
27 those eligible school districts if the total approved costs for which school districts are seeking
28 reimbursement exceed the amount of funding available in any fiscal year;
29 (c) Programs to increase access to voluntary, free, high-quality pre-kindergarten programs.
30 The department shall recommend criteria for the purpose of allocating any and all early childhood
31 program funds as may be determined by the general assembly;
32 (d) Central Falls, Davies, and the Met Center Stabilization Fund is established to ensure
33 that appropriate funding is available to support their students. Additional support for Central Falls
34 is needed due to concerns regarding the city’s limited capacity to meet the local share of education
LC002910 - Page 4 of 8

1 costs. The total amount allocated to the Central Falls stabilization fund shall be the difference
2 between the total foundation amount and state formula aid, pursuant to § 16-7.2-3, plus funding for
3 all costs outside the permanent foundation education-aid formula, calculated based on the most
4 recently published UCOA (Universal Charter of Accounts) expenditures data for the Central Falls
5 school district, adjusted for inflation and the percentage change in the resident average daily
6 membership for the city of Central Falls. This fund requires that education aid calculated pursuant
7 to § 16-7.2-3 and funding for costs outside the permanent foundation education-aid formula,
8 including, but not limited to, transportation, facility maintenance, and retiree health benefit, tuition
9 payments for outplaced special education students, and tuition payments to other public schools,
10 shall be shared between the state and the city of Central Falls. The fund shall be annually reviewed
11 to determine the amount of the state and city appropriation. The city appropriation shall be equal
12 to the annual revenue distributed to the city of Central Falls via § 45-13-5.1. The state’s share of
13 this fund may be supported through a reallocation of current state appropriations to the Central
14 Falls school district. At the end of the transition period defined in § 16-7.2-7, the municipality will
15 continue its contribution pursuant to § 16-7-24. Additional support for the Davies and the Met
16 Center is needed due to the costs associated with running a stand-alone high school offering both
17 academic and career and technical coursework. The department shall recommend criteria for the
18 purpose of allocating any and all Davies and the Met Center stabilization funds as may be
19 determined by the general assembly;
20 (e) Excess costs associated with transporting students to out-of-district non-public schools.
21 This fund will provide state funding for the costs associated with transporting students to out-of-
22 district non-public schools, pursuant to chapter 21.1 of this title. The state will assume the costs of
23 non-public out-of-district transportation for those districts participating in the statewide system.
24 The department of elementary and secondary education shall prorate the funds available for
25 distribution among those eligible school districts if the total approved costs for which school
26 districts are seeking reimbursement exceed the amount of funding available in any fiscal year;
27 (f) Excess costs associated with transporting students within regional school districts. This
28 fund will provide direct state funding for the excess costs associated with transporting students
29 within regional school districts, established pursuant to chapter 3 of this title. This fund requires
30 that the state and regional school district share equally the student transportation costs net any
31 federal sources of revenue for these expenditures. The department of elementary and secondary
32 education shall prorate the funds available for distribution among those eligible school districts if
33 the total approved costs for which school districts are seeking reimbursement exceed the amount
34 of funding available in any fiscal year;
