19 16-7-39. Computation of school housing-aid ratio.
20 For each community, the percent of state aid for school housing costs shall be computed in
21 the following manner:
22 (1) The adjusted equalized weighted assessed valuation for the district is divided by the
23 resident average daily membership for the district (grades twelve (12) and below); (2) The adjusted
24 equalized weighted assessed valuation for the state is divided by the resident average daily
25 membership for the state (grades twelve (12) and below); (1) is then divided by (2) and the resultant
26 ratio is multiplied by a factor currently set at sixty-two percent (62%) which represents the
27 approximate average district share of school support; the resulting product is then subtracted from
28 one hundred percent (100%) to yield the housing aid share ratio, provided that in no case shall the
29 ratio be less than thirty percent (30%). Provided, that effective July 1, 2010, and annually at the
30 start of each fiscal year thereafter, the thirty percent (30%) floor on said housing-aid share shall be
31 increased by five percent (5%) increments each year until said floor on the housing-aid share ratio

34 prior to June 30, 2012. Provided further, for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2012, and for
LC000592 - Page 3 of 12
1 subsequent fiscal years, the minimum housing aid share shall be thirty-five percent (35%) for all
2 projects receiving council on elementary and secondary education approval after June 30, 2012.
3 The resident average daily membership shall be determined in accordance with § 16-7-22(1).
4 (2) No district shall receive a combined total of more than twenty (20) incentive percentage
5 points for projects that commence construction by June 30, 2024, and five (5) incentive points for
6 projects that commence construction thereafter; provided further, these caps shall be in addition to
7 amounts received under §§ 16-7-40(a)(1) and, 16-7-40(a)(2), 16-7-40(j)(1) and 16-7-40(j)(2)..
8 Furthermore, a district’s share shall not be decreased by more than half of its regular share
9 irrespective of the number of incentive points received nor shall a district’s state share increase by
10 more than half of its regular share, including amounts received under §§ 16-7-40(a)(1) and 16-7-
11 40(a)(2), irrespective of the number of incentive points received. Provided further that the
12 aforementioned limit on the state share increasing by more than half of its regular share shall not
13 apply to projects submitted for reimbursement after July 1, 2023.

23 continue to be applied for as long as the project(s) receives state housing aid. In order to qualify for
24 the increased share ratio, seventy-five percent (75%) of the project costs must be specifically
25 directed to school safety and security measures. The council on elementary and secondary
26 education shall promulgate rules and regulations for the administration and operation of this

19 16-7-39. Computation of school housing-aid ratio.
20 For each community, the percent of state aid for school housing costs shall be computed in

22 (1) The adjusted equalized weighted assessed valuation for the district is divided by the
23 resident average daily membership for the district (grades twelve (12) and below); (2) The adjusted
24 equalized weighted assessed valuation for the state is divided by the resident average daily
25 membership for the state (grades twelve (12) and below); (1) is then divided by (2) and the resultant
26 ratio is multiplied by a factor currently set at sixty-two percent (62%) which represents the
27 approximate average district share of school support; the resulting product is then subtracted from
28 one hundred percent (100%) to yield the housing aid share ratio, provided that in no case shall the
29 ratio be less than thirty percent (30%). Provided, that effective July 1, 2010, and annually at the
30 start of each fiscal year thereafter, the thirty percent (30%) floor on said housing-aid share shall be
31 increased by five percent (5%) increments each year until said floor on the housing-aid share ratio

34 prior to June 30, 2012. Provided further, for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2012, and for
LC000592 - Page 3 of 12

1 subsequent fiscal years, the minimum housing aid share shall be thirty-five percent (35%) for all
2 projects receiving council on elementary and secondary education approval after June 30, 2012.
3 The resident average daily membership shall be determined in accordance with § 16-7-22(1).
4 (2) No district shall receive a combined total of more than twenty (20) incentive percentage
5 points for projects that commence construction by June 30, 2024, and five (5) incentive points for
6 projects that commence construction thereafter; provided further, these caps shall be in addition to
7 amounts received under §§ 16-7-40(a)(1) and, 16-7-40(a)(2), 16-7-40(j)(1) and 16-7-40(j)(2)..
8 Furthermore, a district’s share shall not be decreased by more than half of its regular share
9 irrespective of the number of incentive points received nor shall a district’s state share increase by
10 more than half of its regular share, including amounts received under §§ 16-7-40(a)(1) and 16-7-
11 40(a)(2), irrespective of the number of incentive points received. Provided further that the
12 aforementioned limit on the state share increasing by more than half of its regular share shall not
13 apply to projects submitted for reimbursement after July 1, 2023.

21 safety and security, the school housing aid share ratio shall be increased by five percent (5%) for
22 these specific projects only, in the calculation of school housing aid. The increased share ratio shall
23 continue to be applied for as long as the project(s) receives state housing aid. In order to qualify for
24 the increased share ratio, seventy-five percent (75%) of the project costs must be specifically
25 directed to school safety and security measures. The council on elementary and secondary
26 education shall promulgate rules and regulations for the administration and operation of this
27 section.

29 building authority, including the remediation of hazardous materials, the school housing aid ratio

3 the moratorium because of immediate health and safety reasons, those proposals shall be reported
4 to the chairs of the house and senate finance committees.
5 (c) Any project approval granted prior to the adoption of the school construction
6 regulations in 2007, and which are currently inactive; and any project approval granted prior to the
7 adoption of the school construction regulations in 2007 which did not receive voter approval or

10 for further cost containment strategies in the school housing aid program.
11 (d) Beginning July 1, 2015, the council on elementary and secondary education shall
12 approve new necessity of school construction applications on an annual basis. The department of

21 ensure community involvement throughout the investigation and remediation of contaminated
22 building sites for possible reuse as the location of a school. That process will fulfill all provisions
23 of § 23-19.14-5 related to the investigation of reuse of such sites for schools.
24 (g) Beginning July 1, 2019, school housing projects exceeding one million five hundred
25 thousand dollars ($1,500,000) subject to inflation shall include an owner’s program manager and a
26 commissioning agent. The cost of the program manager and commissioning agent shall be
27 considered a project cost eligible for aid pursuant to §§ 16-7-41 and 16-105-5.
28 (h) Temporary housing, or swing space, for students shall be a reimbursable expense so
29 long as a district can demonstrate that no other viable option to temporarily house students exists
30 and provided that use of the temporary space is time limited for a period not to exceed twenty-four
31 (24) months and tied to a specific construction project.
32 (i) Environmental site remediation, as defined by the school building authority, shall be a
33 reimbursable expense up to one million dollars ($1,000,000) per project.
34 (j) If, within thirty (30) years of construction, a newly constructed school is sold to a private
LC000592 - Page 7 of 12

1 entity, the state shall receive a portion of the sale proceeds equal to that project’s housing aid
2 reimbursement rate at the time of project completion.
3 (k) All projects must comply with § 37-13-6, ensuring that prevailing wage laws are being
4 followed, and § 37-14.1-6, ensuring that minority business enterprises reach the required minimum
5 participation, and § 37-13-3.1, ensuring apprenticeship program utilization.
6 (l) Using reviewable criteria, all projects seeking school housing aid shall complete an
7 independent, objective, reasoned study on all projects over ten million dollars ($10,000,000) to
8 determine whether adoption of a project labor agreement on the proposed project or projects will
9 help achieve the goals of the state purchases act.
