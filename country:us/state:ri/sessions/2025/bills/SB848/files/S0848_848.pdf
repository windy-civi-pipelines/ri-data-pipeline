7 after January 1, 2021, except that the license fee for all hospitals located in Washington County,
8 Rhode Island shall be discounted by thirty-seven percent (37%). The discount for Washington
9 County hospitals is subject to approval by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and
10 Human Services of a state plan amendment submitted by the executive office of health and human
11 services for the purpose of pursuing a waiver of the uniformity requirement for the hospital license
12 fee. This licensing fee shall be administered and collected by the tax administrator, division of

14 provisions of chapter 51 of title 44 shall apply. Every hospital shall pay the licensing fee to the tax
15 administrator on or before June 30, 2023, and payments shall be made by electronic transfer of
16 monies to the general treasurer and deposited to the general fund. Every hospital shall, on or before
17 May 25, 2023, make a return to the tax administrator containing the correct computation of net
18 patient-services revenue for the hospital fiscal year ending September 30, 2021, and the licensing
19 fee due upon that amount. All returns shall be signed by the hospital’s authorized representative,

1 subject to the pains and penalties of perjury.

5 January 1, 2022. The hospital licensing fee shall have three (3) tiers with differing fees based on
6 inpatient and outpatient net patient-services revenue. The executive office of health and human
7 services, in consultation with the tax administrator, shall identify the hospitals in each tier, subject
8 to the definitions in this section, by July 15, 2023, and shall notify each hospital of its tier by August

27 hospitals.
28 (1) The inpatient hospital licensing fee for Tier 2 is equal to two and sixty-three hundredths
29 percent (2.63%) of the inpatient net patient-services revenue derived from inpatient net patient-
30 services revenue of every Tier 2 hospital.
31 (2) The outpatient hospital licensing fee for Tier 2 is equal to two and sixty-six hundredths
