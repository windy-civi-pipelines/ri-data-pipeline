ANDREW J. ANNALDO, JR." ON MAY 7TH OF 2025
Introduced By: Senators Bissaillon, Gu, Sosnowski, Raptakis, DiPalma, LaMountain,
Murray, Rogers, Paolino, and Thompson
Date Introduced: May 07, 2025
Referred To: Recommended for Immediate Consideration
1 WHEREAS, In 1910, Wanskuck Library first opened its doors with 1,117 volumes that
2 had formerly been contained in the Wanskuck Company's employees' library; and
3 WHEREAS, In addition, the Wanskuck Company provided the space rent-free, as well as
4 the janitorial services for the creation of the Library; and
5 WHEREAS, In November of 1928, the Providence Public Library opened a library
6 branch on Veazie Street that served Wanskuck residents until 1981, when due to a shortage of
7 funding, the Providence Public Library closed the Wanskuck Library in order to save money; and
8 WHEREAS, The Library's closure devasted the Wanskuck and North End communities
9 until newly elected Councilman Andrew J. Annaldo, Jr. vowed to find the funds necessary to
10 reopen the Library; and
11 WHEREAS, In 1984, the stalwart Councilor Annaldo, along with a dedicated group of
12 local library advocates succeeded in their mission, and generated the funding necessary to reopen
13 the beloved Library; and
14 WHEREAS, On the eve of the Wanskuck Library's reopening date, a fire ultimately
15 delayed the public opening until June 3, 1987, and shortly thereafter, the dedicated group of local
16 library advocates started the Library's first Library Friends group in order to ensure the Library's
17 continuous presence in the community; and
18 WHEREAS, Literacy skills are essential for effective participation in our democracy, in
19 the workplace, and in the community. Lady Bird Johnson once said, "Perhaps no place in any
1 community is so totally democratic as the town library. The only entrance requirement is
2 interest.", and thus it is entirely appropriate and essential to commend the efforts of the Honorable
3 Andrew Annaldo and the dedicated local Library Friends group for their efforts to continue to
4 make the Library's resources available to all who walk through its doors; now, therefore be it
5 RESOLVED, That this Senate of the State of Rhode Island hereby honors and celebrates
6 the saving of Wanskuck Library and Councilman Annaldo's role in saving the library and the
7 community members who helped him; and be it further
8 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
9 transmit duly certified copies of this resolution to the Honorable Andrew J. Annaldo, Jr., and
10 Denise Brophy, Wanskuck Library Manager.
