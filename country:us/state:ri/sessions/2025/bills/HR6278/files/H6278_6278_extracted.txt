1 WHEREAS, The Community College of Rhode Island (CCRI) was founded in 1964 as
2 Rhode Island Junior College, providing a gateway to higher education for all Rhode Islanders.
3 The college welcomed its first class of 325 students at the Henry Barnard School in Providence.
4 By 1965, a section of the former Brown & Sharpe building was used for additional classroom
5 space and served as the primary facility until 1972; and
6 WHEREAS, As the state’s demand for accessible public higher education grew, so did
7 CCRI. In 1972, the Knight Campus in Warwick—built on land donated by the Knight Family—
8 became the college’s flagship campus and first permanent home. The Flanagan Campus in
9 Lincoln opened in 1976, followed by the Liston Campus in Providence in 1990, and the Newport
10 County Campus in 2006, ensuring that all Rhode Islanders have access to quality education close
11 to home; and
12 WHEREAS, CCRI is celebrating its 60th anniversary in 2024-2025 with the theme
13 “Empowering Minds and Transforming Communities in Rhode Island since 1964,” recognizing
14 six decades of excellence in education, workforce development, and student success. The college
15 has grown to serve more than 40,000 Rhode Islanders annually and has an alumni network
16 exceeding 80,000 graduates; and
17 WHEREAS, As Rhode Island’s only public community college, CCRI offers more than
18 90 academic degree and certificate programs across a wide range of disciplines. Among its most
19 popular academic programs are Nursing, Business Administration, Cybersecurity, Computer
1 Science, Criminal Justice, and the Liberal Arts; and
2 WHEREAS, CCRI has become the leading provider of skilled trades and technical
3 training in the state, serving as the primary training partner for General Dynamics Electric Boat,
4 where more than 6,000 Rhode Islanders have been trained for careers in the maritime industry.
5 The college is also home to the only Global Wind Organization Basic Safety Training Center in
6 Rhode Island, training workers to support the state’s offshore wind energy sector; and
7 WHEREAS, Due to CCRI’s commitment to workforce development, it has been
8 recognized as New England’s only Center of Excellence for Domestic Maritime Workforce
9 Training and Education by U.S. Department of Transportation’s Maritime Administration
10 (MARAD), and is one of only 17 community colleges nationwide designated as an Industrial
11 Assessment Center by the U.S. Department of Energy; and
12 WHEREAS, With a strong focus on innovation and student success, CCRI has become a
13 leader in expanding college access. The college is the largest provider of full- and part-time early
14 college programs in Rhode Island, with participation in High School Enrichment, Running Start,
15 and Accelerate more than doubling since 2016. Additionally, CCRI’s P-TECH (Pathways in
16 Technology Early College High School) program has allowed students to graduate from CCRI
17 before earning their high school diplomas; and
18 WHEREAS, In recognition of its commitment to equity and student success, CCRI
19 earned the designation of Hispanic-Serving Institution in 2022, reflecting its growing role in
20 serving a diverse student body; and
21 WHEREAS, Under the outstanding leadership of Interim President Dr. Rosemary
22 Costigan, the first CCRI alumna to lead the college, CCRI continues to provide Rhode Islanders
23 with an affordable, high-quality education that leads to strong learning outcomes, successful
24 degree attainment, and meaningful careers; and
25 WHEREAS, As the college embarks on its seventh decade, CCRI remains steadfast in its
26 mission to transform lives and strengthen communities through accessible, high-quality
27 education, ensuring that Rhode Islanders continue to have pathways to socio-economic mobility
28 and success; now, therefore be it
29 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
30 proclaims April 29th of 2025, to be "Community College of Rhode Island Day" in the State of
31 Rhode Island, in recognition of CCRI’s 60 years of excellence in education and workforce
32 development; and be it further
