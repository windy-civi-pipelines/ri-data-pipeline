14 the house of representatives, respectively.
15 (h) The auditor general shall annually review the capital development program to
16 determine: (1) the status of all projects included in the program; (2) whether the funds are being
17 properly expended for their intended purposes; (3) the completion date or projected completion
18 date of the projects; (4) which projects require professional services and to determine the identity
19 of individuals or firms appointed; and (5) the expended and unexpended funds. This report shall be
20 annually submitted to the general assembly on the first Wednesday in February.
21 (i) The auditor general shall supervise, coordinate, and/or conduct investigations and

25 schedule of all state agencies and quasi-public governmental agencies and shall conduct
26 performance audits on the agencies in compliance with such schedule. The auditor general shall
