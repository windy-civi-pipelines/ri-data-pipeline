8 (b) The office, in consultation with the department of environmental management, shall
9 promulgate and adopt rules and regulations to require including, as part of the solar permit
10 application, an assessment whether the proposed solar photovoltaic system would be carbon-neutral
11 in accordance with the emission reduction goals set forth by § 42-6.2-9. The assessment shall detail
12 the amount of carbon sequestration and carbon storage loss that would occur if the permit is
13 approved. The office's rules and regulations shall be adopted no later than November 1, 2025.
14 (c) A solar permit shall only be approved if the proposed solar photovoltaic system is
15 verified to be carbon neutral based upon the assessment submitted under section (b) of this section.

13 (7) A study of alternatives to the proposed facility, including alternatives as to energy
14 sources, methods of energy production, methods for preserving carbon sequestration and carbon
15 storage, and sites for the facility, together with reasons for the applicant’s rejection of these
16 alternatives. The study shall include estimates of facility cost and unit energy costs of alternatives
17 considered.
18 (b) Within thirty (30) days of the filing of an applicant under this chapter, the board shall
19 notify the applicant whether the application is in the form and addresses the matters that are required
