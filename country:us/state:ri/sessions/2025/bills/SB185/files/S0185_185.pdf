13 (2) The payment plan shall be designed to provide for a fixed monthly payment and
14 forgiveness of pre-participation arrearages over a twenty-four (24) month period.
15 (3) The fixed per bill discount shall be designed to approximate an average annual electric
16 expense of not more than three percent (3%) of the income of customers within the applicable tiered
17 class for customers who do not use electric as their primary source of heat, or six percent (6%) of
18 the income of customers within the applicable tiered class who use electric as their primary source

5 (5) To establish the discount tiers and customer eligibility, the commission may consider
6 targeted annual average expense for participants.
7 (6) Notwithstanding the foregoing, a maximum annual benefit and minimum monthly
8 payment shall be established by the commission with input from the electric distribution company,
9 the division of public utilities and carriers, and stakeholders.
10 (b) The cost of the discount, including administrative costs not funded through other
11 sources, shall be collected in rates from all other customers of the electric and gas distribution
12 companies in a manner determined just and reasonable by the commission.
13 (c) In reviewing the proposed payment plan under this section, the commission shall
14 balance the level of discounts with the administrative costs that would be incurred to implement
15 the payment plan.
16 (d) The commission shall render a decision on the proposed percentage of income plan no
17 later than January 15, 2027. The approved plan shall be included as part of the electric and gas
18 company’s next general rate filing and future general rate filings.
19 (e) An electric or gas distribution company shall enroll an eligible customer in the
20 appropriate tier at such time as the electric or gas distribution company receives verification of
21 income level or in some other manner determined to be efficient and cost effective by the
22 commission.
23 (f) Customers enrolled in the tiered discount rate under this section shall be offered energy
24 efficiency programs as appropriate upon enrollment.
