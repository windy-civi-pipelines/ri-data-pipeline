THANKING AND HONORING AMERICA'S AND RHODE ISLAND'S VIETNAM WAR
VETERANS FOR THEIR SERVICE AND SACRIFICE ON "VIETNAM VETERANS DAY"
Introduced By: Senators Felag, E Morgan, Raptakis, Ciccone, Tikoian, Britto, Lauria,
Ujifusa, Gu, and Mack
Date Introduced: April 08, 2025
Referred To: Recommended for Immediate Consideration
1 WHEREAS, Our Nation owes an unmeasurable debt to all those individuals who have
2 served in the United States Armed Forces. Whether volunteering so another would not have to go
3 or answering the call when drafted, our country's Vietnam vets, out of a profound and selfless
4 sense of duty, shouldered the burden of long periods away from home, difficult and frequently
5 dangerous training and deployments, and inherent physical, mental, and emotional risks. Such is
6 the debt we owe to Vietnam War Veterans; and
7 WHEREAS, More than 2.7 million United States Armed Forces personnel served in
8 Vietnam from 1965 to 1975, with approximately 21,000 members from Rhode Island; and
9 WHEREAS, Over 58,000 members of the Armed Forces lost their lives in that conflict,
10 and more than 304,000 were wounded. The casualties included more than 200 service members
11 who called Rhode Island their home; and
12 WHEREAS, Vietnam Veterans were not accorded the same welcome home as those who
13 served in other wars. Rather, those who had answered the call to serve the United States in
14 Vietnam were often treated with animosity by their fellow countrymen upon arriving home; and
15 WHEREAS, Though the Vietnam War was unpopular at the time and continues to have a
16 complex and divisive history today, the brave American citizens who left their homes to serve in
17 Vietnam should be fully supported and honored by a grateful nation; and
18 WHEREAS, Remembering the service of Vietnam Veterans honors their bravery and
19 ensures that they are not forgotten. We remain deeply appreciative of their sacrifice and

1 steadfastly supportive of them and their families who still often grapple with the visible and
2 unseen scars of war; and
3 WHEREAS, In 2017, the Rhode Island General Assembly passed Rhode Island General
4 Law ยง 25-2-20, which sets aside the twenty-ninth day of March annually to be known as
5 "Vietnam Veterans Day"; now, therefore, be it
6 RESOLVED, That this Senate of the State of Rhode Island hereby thanks and honors all
7 of America's and Rhode Island's Vietnam War veterans, and asks that all Rhode Island residents
8 remember their service and sacrifice on behalf of our nation on "Vietnam Veterans Day" on
9 March 29, 2025; and be it further
10 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
11 transmit duly certified copies of this resolution to the Honorable Daniel McKee, Governor of the
12 State of Rhode Island, and Major General Christopher Callahan, Adjutant General of the State of
13 Rhode Island.
