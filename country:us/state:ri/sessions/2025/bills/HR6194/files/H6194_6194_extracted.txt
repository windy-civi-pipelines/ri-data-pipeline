2 WHEREAS, Throughout Rhode Island history, there have been Narragansett, Portuguese,

8 WHEREAS, Our linguistic and cultural diversity is a strength that should be celebrated
9 and nurtured; and

11 populations within American schools and this group of students brings multiple assets to our

13 WHEREAS, Bilingual and Multilingual Learner Month is an opportunity to draw
14 attention to the persistent gap between bilingual and multilingual learners and native English-
15 speaking students; and
16 WHEREAS, Bilingual and Multilingual Learner Month calls on stakeholders at all levels
17 to examine the diverse needs of bilingual and multilingual learners and to build an inclusive and
18 respectful culture; and
19 WHEREAS, Bilingual and Multilingual Learner Month highlights a commitment to
1 ensure educational equity and access, allowing these learners to thrive academically and become
2 productive bi-literate and multiliterate global citizens, and encourages institutions to adopt
3 policies and practices such as dual language instructional programs that value and use students’
4 languages and cultural assets to learn high academic content, promote long-term academic
5 achievement, and increase graduation rates; now, therefore be it
6 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
7 proclaims April of 2025 to be "Bilingual and Multilingual Learner Month" in the State of Rhode
8 Island; and be it further
