2 commissioner of elementary and secondary education; provided that, the individual is still teaching
3 in Rhode Island public schools.

5 chairperson. A quorum shall consist of nine (9) members of the board. A majority vote of those
6 present shall be required for action.
7 (f) Except as provided by subsection (b) of this section, members of the board shall be
8 removable by the governor for cause only. Removal solely for partisan or personal reasons
9 unrelated to performance, capacity, or fitness for the office shall be unlawful.

11 the commissioner of elementary and secondary education, and the commissioner of postsecondary
12 education shall remain unchanged.
13 (h) The chair of the board of education shall consult with the chairs of the council on
