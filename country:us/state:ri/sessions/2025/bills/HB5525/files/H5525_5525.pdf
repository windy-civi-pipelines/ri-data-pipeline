1 SECTION 1. Section 16-16-40 of the General Laws in Chapter 16-16 entitled "Teachers’

5 (a) All teachers and all beneficiaries of teachers receiving any service retirement or

8 adjustment equal to one and one-half percent (1.5%) per year of the original retirement allowance,
9 not compounded, for each year the retirement allowance has been in effect. For purposes of
10 computation credit shall be given for a full calendar year regardless of the effective date of the
11 retirement allowance. This cost of living retirement adjustment shall be added to the amount of the
12 service retirement allowance as of January 1, 1970, and payment shall begin as of July 1, 1970. An
13 additional cost of living retirement adjustment shall be added to the original retirement allowance
14 equal to three percent (3%) of the original retirement allowance on the first day of January, 1971,
15 and each year thereafter through December 31, 1980.
16 (b) All teachers and beneficiaries of teachers receiving any service retirement or ordinary
17 disability retirement allowance pursuant to the provisions of this title who retired on or after January
18 1, 1968, shall, on the first day of January, next following the third (3rd) year on retirement, receive

1 a cost of living adjustment, in addition to their retirement allowance, an amount equal to three
2 percent (3%) of the original retirement allowance. In each succeeding year thereafter, on the first
3 day of January, the retirement allowance shall be increased an additional three percent (3%) of the
4 original retirement allowance, not compounded, to be continued through December 31, 1980.
5 (c)(1) Beginning on January 1, 1981, for all teachers and beneficiaries of teachers receiving
6 any service retirement and all teachers and all beneficiaries of teachers who have completed at least
7 ten (10) years of contributory service on or before July 1, 2005, pursuant to the provisions of this
8 chapter, and for all teachers and beneficiaries of teachers who receive a disability retirement
9 allowance pursuant to §§ 16-16-14 — 16-16-17, the cost of living adjustment shall be computed
10 and paid at the rate of three percent (3%) of the original retirement allowance or the retirement
11 allowance as computed in accordance with § 16-16-40.1, compounded annually from the year for
12 which the cost of living adjustment was determined to be payable by the retirement board pursuant
13 to the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) of this section. Such cost of living adjustments are available
14 to teachers who retire before October 1, 2009, or are eligible to retire as of September 30, 2009.
15 (2) The provisions of this subsection shall be deemed to apply prospectively only and no
16 retroactive payment shall be made.
17 (3) The retirement allowance of all teachers and all beneficiaries of teachers who have not

19 eligible to retire as of September 30, 2009, shall, on the month following the third anniversary date
20 of the retirement, and on the month following the anniversary date of each succeeding year be
21 adjusted and computed by multiplying the retirement allowance by three percent (3%) or the
22 percentage of increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) as published
23 by the United States Department of Labor Statistics, determined as of September 30 of the prior
24 calendar year, whichever is less; the cost of living adjustment shall be compounded annually from
25 the year for which the cost of living adjustment was determined payable by the retirement board;
26 provided, that no adjustment shall cause any retirement allowance to be decreased from the
27 retirement allowance provided immediately before such adjustment.
28 (d) For teachers not eligible to retire in accordance with this chapter as of September 30,
29 2009, and not eligible upon passage of this article, and for their beneficiaries, the cost of living
30 adjustment described in subsection (c)(3) of this section shall only apply to the first thirty-five
31 thousand dollars ($35,000) of retirement allowance, indexed annually, and shall commence upon
32 the third (3rd) anniversary of the date of retirement or when the retiree reaches age sixty-five (65),
33 whichever is later. The thirty-five thousand dollar ($35,000) limit shall increase annually by the
34 percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) as published
LC001302 - Page 2 of 12

1 by the United States Department of Labor Statistics determined as of September 30 of the prior
2 calendar year or three percent (3%), whichever is less. The first thirty-five thousand dollars
3 ($35,000), as indexed, of retirement allowance shall be multiplied by the percentage of increase in

21 indexed annually in the same percentage as determined under (f)(1)(A) above. The “Five-Year
22 Average Investment Return” shall mean the average of the investment returns of the most recent
23 five (5) plan years as determined by the retirement board. Subject to subsection (f)(2) below, the
24 benefit adjustment provided by this subsection (f)(1) shall commence upon the third (3rd)
25 anniversary of the date of retirement or the date on which the retiree reaches their Social Security
