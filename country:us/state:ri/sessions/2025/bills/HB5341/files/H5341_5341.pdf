1 (i) For the purpose of the above fee schedule, “overall length” shall be defined as the
2 horizontal distance between the foremost part of the stem, and, the aftermost part of the stern,

6 (ii) The fee payable under this section for any motorboat owned by a nonprofit organization

8 (iii) All vessels over thirty feet (30′) may, upon request, pay the registration fee annually

10 (iv) In addition to the registration fee payable under this section, the owner of each
11 motorboat shall pay five dollars ($5.00) biennially. Pursuant to this section, where the owner of a
12 motorboat pays an annual registration fee, the additional fee shall be two dollars and fifty cents
13 ($2.50) annually. The additional fees shall be deposited in a restricted account for freshwater
14 preservation as set forth in § 46-33-3.
15 (2) Upon receipt of the completed application and correct registration fee, the department
16 of environmental management shall enter the application and registration fee into its records, and
17 issue to the owner a certificate of number stating the number awarded to the motorboat and the
18 name and address of the owner. The owner shall paint on or attach to each side of the bow of the
19 motorboat the identification number in such manner as may be prescribed by rules and regulations
20 of the department of environmental management in order that it may be clearly visible. The number
21 shall be maintained in legible condition. The certificate of number shall be pocket size and shall be
22 available at all times for inspection on the motorboat for which issued, whenever that motorboat is
23 in operation.
24 (b) The owner of any motorboat already covered by an identification number, in full force

27 environmental management prior to operating the motorboat on the waters of this state in excess of
28 the ninety (90) day reciprocity period provided for in § 46-22-6(a). The recordation shall be in the
29 manner and subject to the procedure and fees required for the award and transfer of a number under
30 subsections (a) and (c) through (i), except that no additional or substitute number shall be issued.
31 (c) Should the ownership of a motorboat change, a new application form shall be filed with
32 the department of environmental management. Should the change in ownership take place before
33 the date upon which the certificate of number expires, the new owner shall pay an administrative
34 fee of ten dollars ($10.00). The number assigned to the vessel shall remain with the vessel and be

1 non-transferable while the vessel remains certified in the state of Rhode Island; provided, however,
2 that upon the request of the owner of a duly registered vessel of historic value that is more than
3 fifty (50) years old, the number assigned to the vessel may be transferred to a different historic
4 vessel owned by the same person. The original vessel will be given a new registration number and
5 the owner shall pay a transfer fee of six dollars ($6.00) for each vessel.
6 (d) In the event that an agency of the United States government shall have in force an
7 overall system of identification numbering for motorboats within the United States, the numbering
8 system employed pursuant to this chapter by the department of environmental management shall
9 be in conformity therewith.
10 (e) All records of the department of environmental management made or kept pursuant to
11 this section shall be public records.

16 transfer of all or any part of the owner’s interest, other than the creation of a security interest in a
17 motorboat numbered in this state, pursuant to subsections (a) and (b), or of the destruction or
18 abandonment of the motorboat, within fifteen (15) days thereof. That destruction shall terminate
19 the certificate of number for the motorboat.
20 (h) Any holder of a certificate of number shall notify the department of environmental
21 management within fifteen (15) days if the holder’s address no longer conforms to the address
22 appearing on the certificate and shall, as a part of the notification, furnish the department of
23 environmental management the new address. The department of environmental management may
24 provide, in its rules and regulations, for the surrender of the certificate bearing the former address
25 or for the alteration of an outstanding certificate to show the new address of the holder.
26 (i) No number, other than the number awarded to a motorboat or granted reciprocity
27 pursuant to this chapter, shall be painted, attached, or otherwise displayed on either side of the bow
28 of the motorboat.
