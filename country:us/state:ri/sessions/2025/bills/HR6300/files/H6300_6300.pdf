PROCLAIMING THE FIRST FULL WEEK OF MAY, 2025, TO BE "COMPOSTING
AWARENESS WEEK" IN THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND
Introduced By: Representatives Cortvriend, Shekarchi, Blazejewski, Chippendale,
Boylan, Speakman, McGaw, Carson, Donovan, and Bennett
Date Introduced: May 06, 2025
Referred To: House read and passed
1 WHEREAS, Each year, Composting Awareness Week is celebrated nationwide during
2 the first full week of May with the goal of raising public awareness of the environmental benefits
3 of composting; and
4 WHEREAS, Compost is a mixture made up of organic materials such as yard trimmings,
5 vegetable and fruit peels and scraps, other food scraps, flowers, eggshells, paper products,
6 nutshells, sawdust, wood chips, biosolids, manure, hay shavings, and leaves, which are rich in
7 moisture and nutrients, and when added to the soil in gardens and farms, helps plants and crops
8 grow; and
9 WHEREAS, By retaining and transferring moisture through the soil to the plant,
10 composting minimizes the need for irrigation, reduces water usage by up to 30 percent, conserves
11 water during droughts, and prevents flooding by retaining water that would otherwise enter drains
12 and sewers; and
13 WHEREAS, Rich in both nutrients and organisms, compost is beneficial for plant health
14 and growth, as well as worms, centipedes, spiders, beetles, and fungal mycelium, which results in
15 minimizing the need for chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and reduces soil and water pollution;
16 and
17 WHEREAS, Composting reduces waste by reusing and recycling organic materials,
18 which make up approximately 30 percent of all materials sent to landfills, and can help
19 communities that implement composting programs to efficiently divert waste from landfills and

1 become more sustainable; and
2 WHEREAS, The beneficial organisms and microbes in compost also sequester and retain
3 carbon in the soil, and help to prevent carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases,
4 which would otherwise be released into the atmosphere in large amounts due to decomposing
5 waste in landfills; and
6 WHEREAS, By using compost in certain public works projects, such as the construction
7 and improvement of parks, trails, highways, and green spaces, composting can lead to large-scale
8 reductions in pollution, help to prevent climate change, and lead to the creation of green jobs;
9 now, therefore be it
10 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
11 proclaims the first full week of May to be "Composting Awareness Week" and respectfully urges
12 the Governor and the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management to observe the
13 week with appropriate activities and programs. We moreover encourage all Rhode Islanders to
14 start composting and help build a healthier environment for all; and be it further
15 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
16 transmit duly certified copies of this resolution to the Honorable Daniel McKee, Governor of the
17 State of Rhode Island, and Terrence Gray, Director of the Rhode Island Department of
18 Environmental Management.
