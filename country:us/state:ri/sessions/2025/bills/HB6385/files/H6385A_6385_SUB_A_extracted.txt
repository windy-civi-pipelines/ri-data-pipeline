4 Laws of Rhode Island, including every chapter and section therein, and any chapters and sections
5 thereof not included in this act may be, and are hereby, reenacted as if fully set forth herein.
6 SECTION 2. Sections 27-1-46 and 27-1-47 of the General Laws in Chapter 27-1 entitled
7 "Domestic Insurance Companies" are hereby amended to read as follows:
8 27-1-46. Information security program.
9 (a) Commensurate with the size and complexity of an insurer, the nature and scope of an
10 insurer’s activities, including its use of third-party service providers, and the sensitivity of the
11 nonpublic information used by the insurer or in the insurer’s possession, custody, or control, each
12 domestic insurance company shall develop, implement, and maintain a comprehensive written
13 information security program, based on the insurer’s risk assessment and that contains
14 administrative, technical, and physical safeguards for the protection of nonpublic information and
15 the insurer’s information system. For purposes of this chapter, “information security program”
16 means the administrative, technical, and physical safeguards that an insurer uses to access, collect,
17 distribute, process, protect, store, use, transmit, dispose of, or otherwise handle, nonpublic
18 information. “Publicly available information” means any information that a licensee has a
1 reasonable basis to believe is lawfully made available to the general public from: federal, state, or
2 local government records; widely distributed media; or disclosures to the general public that are
3 required to be made by federal, state, or local law. “Nonpublic information” means information
4 that is not publicly available information and is:
5 (1) Business-related information of a licensee, the tampering with which, or unauthorized
6 disclosure, access, or use of which, would cause a material adverse impact to the business,
7 operations, or security of the licensee;
8 (2) Any information concerning a consumer which, because of name, number, personal
9 mark, or other identifier, can be used to identify such consumer, in combination with any one or
10 more of the following data elements:
11 (i) Social security number;
12 (ii) Driver’s license number or non-driver identification card number;
13 (iii) Account number, credit, or debit card number;
14 (iv) Any security code, access code, or password that would permit access to a consumer’s
15 financial account; or
16 (v) Biometric records;
17 (3) Any information or data, except age or gender, in any form or medium created by or
18 derived from a healthcare provider or a consumer and that relates to:
19 (i) The past, present, or future physical, mental, behavioral health, or medical condition of
20 any consumer or a member of the consumer’s family;
21 (ii) The provision of health care to any consumer; or

23 (b) Objectives of information security program. An insurer’s information security
24 program shall be designed to:
25 (1) Protect the security and confidentiality of nonpublic information and the security of the
26 information system;
27 (2) Protect against any threats or hazards to the security or integrity of nonpublic
28 information and the information system;
29 (3) Protect against unauthorized access to or use of nonpublic information, and minimize
30 the likelihood of harm to any consumer. For purposes of this section, “consumer” means an
31 individual, including, but not limited to, applicants, policyholders, insureds, beneficiaries,
32 claimants, and certificate holders, who is a resident of this state and whose nonpublic information
33 is in an insurer’s possession, custody, or control; and
34 (4) Define and periodically reevaluate a schedule for retention of nonpublic information

9 person, not otherwise defined as a licensee, that contracts with a licensee to maintain, process, store,
10 or otherwise is permitted access to nonpublic information through its provision of services to the
11 licensee. Third-party service providers does not include licensed insurance producers;
12 (3) Assess the likelihood and potential damage of these threats, taking into consideration
13 the sensitivity of the nonpublic information;

15 ARTICLED VII.
16 RULES AND OPERATING PROCEDURES: RULEMAKING FUNCTIONS OF THE
17 COMMISSION AND OPTING OUT OF UNIFORM STANDARDS
18 (1) Rulemaking authority. The commission shall promulgate reasonable rules, including
19 uniform standards, and operating procedures in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the
20 purposes of this compact. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the commission exercises its
21 rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this act, or the powers
22 granted hereunder, then such an action by the commission shall be invalid and have no force and
23 effect.
24 (2) Rulemaking procedure. Rules and operating procedures shall be made pursuant to a
25 rulemaking process that conforms to the Model State Administrative Procedure Act of 1981 as
26 amended, as may be appropriate to the operations of the commission. Before the commission adopts
27 a uniform standard, the commission shall give written notice to the relevant state legislative
28 committee(s) in each compacting state responsible for insurance issues of its intention to adopt the
29 uniform standard. The commission in adopting a uniform standard shall consider fully all submitted
30 materials and issue a concise explanation of its decision.
31 (3) Effective date and opt out of a uniform standard. A uniform standard shall become
32 effective ninety (90) days after its promulgation by the commission or such later date as the
33 commission may determine; provided, however, that a compacting state may opt out of a uniform
34 standard as provided in this Article. “Opt out” shall be defined as any action by a compacting state
LC002933/SUB A - Page 19 of 126
1 to decline to adopt or participate in a promulgated uniform standard. All other rules and operating
2 procedures, and amendments thereto, shall become effective as of the date specified in each rule,
3 operating procedure or amendment.
4 (4) Opt out procedure. A compacting state may opt out of a uniform standard, either by
5 legislation or regulation duly promulgated by the insurance department under the Compacting
6 State’s Administrative Procedure Act. If a compacting state elects to opt out of a uniform standard
7 by regulation, it must: (a) give written notice to the commission no later than ten (10) business days
8 after the uniform standard is promulgated, or at the time the state becomes a compacting state; and
9 (b) find that the uniform standard does not provide reasonable protections to the citizens of the
10 state, given the conditions in the state. The commissioner shall make specific findings of fact and
11 conclusions of law, based on a preponderance of the evidence, detailing the conditions in the state
12 which warrant a departure from the uniform standard and determining that the uniform standard
13 would not reasonably protect the citizens of the state. The commissioner must consider and balance
14 the following factors and find that the conditions in the state and needs of the citizens of the state
15 outweigh: (i) the intent of the legislature to participate in, and the benefits of, an interstate
16 agreement to establish national uniform consumer protections for the products subject to this act;
17 and (ii) the presumption that a uniform standard adopted by the commission provides reasonable
18 protections to consumers of the relevant product.
19 Notwithstanding the foregoing, a compacting state, may, at the time of its enactment of this
20 compact, prospectively opt out of all uniform standards involving long-term care insurance
21 products by expressly providing for such opt out in the enacted compact, and such an opt out shall
22 not be treated as a material variance in the offer or acceptance of any state to participate in this
23 compact. Such an opt out shall be effective at the time of enactment of this compact by the
24 compacting state and shall apply to all existing uniform standards involving long-term care
25 insurance products and those subsequently promulgated.
26 (5) Effect of opt out. If a compacting state elects to opt out of a uniform standard, the
27 uniform standard shall remain applicable in the compacting state electing to opt out until such time
28 the opt out legislation is enacted into law or the regulation opting out becomes effective.
29 Once the opt out of a uniform standard by a compacting state becomes effective as provided
30 under the laws of that state, the uniform standard shall have no further force and effect in that state
31 unless and until the legislation or regulation implementing the opt out is repealed or otherwise
32 becomes ineffective under the laws of the state. If a compacting state opts out of a uniform standard
33 after the uniform standard has been made effective in that state, the opt out shall have the same
34 prospective effect as provided under Article XIV for withdrawals.
LC002933/SUB A - Page 20 of 126
1 (6) Stay of uniform standard. If a compacting state has formally initiated the process of
2 opting out of a uniform standard by regulation, and while the regulatory opt out is pending, the
3 compacting state may petition the commission, at least fifteen (15) days before the effective date
4 of the uniform standard, to stay the effectiveness of the uniform standard in that state. The
5 commission may grant a stay if it determines the regulatory opt out is being pursued in a reasonable
6 manner and there is a likelihood of success. If a stay is granted or extended by the commission, the
7 stay or extension thereof may postpone the effective date by up to ninety (90) days, unless
8 affirmatively extended by the commission; provided, a stay may not be permitted to remain in
9 effect for more than one (1) year unless the compacting state can show extraordinary circumstances
10 which warrant a continuance of the stay, including, but not limited to, the existence of a legal
11 challenge which prevents the compacting state from opting out. A stay may be terminated by the
12 commission upon notice that the rulemaking process has been terminated.
13 (7) Not later than thirty (30) days after a rule or operating procedure is promulgated any
14 person may file a petition for judicial review of the rule or operating procedure; provided, that the
15 filing of such a petition shall not stay or otherwise prevent the rule or operating procedure from
16 becoming effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substantial likelihood of success.
17 The court shall give deference to the actions of the commission consistent with applicable law and
18 shall not find the rule or operating procedure to be unlawful if the rule or operating procedure
19 represents a reasonable exercise of the commission’s authority.
20 ARTICLE VIII.
21 COMMISSION RECORDS AND ENFORCEMENT
22 (1) The commission shall promulgate rules establishing conditions and procedures for
23 public inspection and copying of its information and official records, except such information and
24 records involving the privacy of individuals and insurers’ trade secrets. The commission may
25 promulgate additional rules under which it may make available to federal and state agencies
26 including law enforcement agencies, records and information otherwise exempt from disclosure
27 and may enter into agreements with such agencies to receive or exchange information or records
28 subject to nondisclosure and confidentiality provisions.
29 (2) Except as to privileged records, data and information, the laws of any compacting state
30 pertaining to confidentiality or nondisclosure shall not relieve any compacting state commissioner
31 of the duty to disclose any relevant records, data or information to the commission; provided, that
32 disclosure to the commission shall not be deemed to waive or otherwise affect any confidentiality
33 requirement; and further provided, that, except as otherwise expressly provided in this act, the
34 commission shall not be subject to the compacting state’s laws pertaining to confidentiality and
LC002933/SUB A - Page 21 of 126

2 information of the commission shall remain confidential after such information is provided to any
3 commissioner.

5 bylaws, rules, including uniform standards, and operating procedures. The commission shall notify
6 any noncomplying compacting state in writing of its noncompliance with commission bylaws, rules
7 or operating procedures. If a noncomplying compacting state fails to remedy its noncompliance
8 within the time specified in the notice of noncompliance, the compacting state shall be deemed to
9 be in default as set forth in Article XIV.
10 (4) The commissioner of any state in which an insurer is authorized to do business, or is
11 conducting the business of insurance, shall continue to exercise his or her authority to oversee the
12 market regulation of the activities of the insurer in accordance with the provisions of the state’s
13 law. The commissioner’s enforcement of compliance with the compact is governed by the state
14 following provisions:
15 (a) With respect to the commissioner’s market regulation of a product or advertisement
16 that is approved or certified to the commission, the content of the product or advertisement shall
17 not constitute a violation of the provisions, standards or requirements of the compact except upon
18 a final order of the commission, issued at the request of a commissioner after prior notice to the
19 insurer and an opportunity for hearing before the commission.
20 (b) Before a commissioner may bring an action for violation of any provision, standard or
21 requirement of the compact relating to the content of an advertisement not approved or certified to
22 the commission, the commission, or an authorized commission officer or employee, must authorize
23 the section action. However, authorization pursuant to this paragraph does not require notice to the
24 insurer, opportunity for hearing or disclosure of requests for authorization or records of the
25 commission’s action on such requests.
26 ARTICLE IX.
27 DISPUTE RESOLUTION
28 The commission shall attempt, upon the request of a member, to resolve any disputes or
29 other issues that are subject to this compact and which may arise between two (2) or more
30 compacting states, or between compacting states and noncompacting states, and the commission
31 shall promulgate an operating procedure providing for resolution of such disputes.

LC002933/SUB A - Page 22 of 126

2 shall be construed to restrict or otherwise prevent an insurer from filing its product with the
3 insurance department in any state wherein the insurer is licensed to conduct the business of
4 insurance, and such filing shall be subject to the laws of the states where filed.
5 (2) The commission shall establish appropriate filing and review processes and procedures
6 pursuant to commission rules and operating procedures. Notwithstanding any provision herein to
7 the contrary, the commission shall promulgate rules to establish conditions and procedures under
8 which the commission will provide public access to product filing information. In establishing such
9 rules, the commission shall consider the interests of the public in having access to such information,
10 as well as protection of personal medical and financial information and trade secrets, that may be
11 contained in a product filing or supporting information.
12 (3) Any product approved by the commission may be sold or otherwise issued in those
13 compacting states for which the insurer is legally authorized to do business.

17 product or advertisement filed with the commission, the insurer or third party filer whose filing was
18 disapproved may appeal the determination to a review panel appointed by the commission. The
19 commission shall promulgate rules to establish procedures for appointing such review panels and
20 provide for notice and hearing. An allegation that the commission, in disapproving a product or
21 advertisement filed with the commission, acted arbitrarily, capriciously, or in a manner that is an
22 abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with the law, is subject to judicial review in
23 accordance with Article III, Section 5.
24 (2) The commission shall have authority to monitor, review and reconsider products and
25 advertisement subsequent to their filing or approval upon a finding that the product does not meet
26 the relevant uniform standard. Where appropriate, the commission may withdraw or modify its

12 SECTION 9. Sections 27-6-8.1 and 27-6-53 of the General Laws in Chapter 27-6 entitled
13 "Fire and Marine Insurance Rating" are hereby amended to read as follows:
14 27-6-8.1. Rating for nonbusiness policies.
15 (a) Notwithstanding the requirements of § 27-6-8, a filing made by an insurer under this
16 section that provides for an overall statewide rate increase or decrease of no more than five percent
17 (5%) in the aggregate for all coverages that are subject to the filing may take effect the date it is
18 filed. The five percent (5%) limitation does not apply on an individual insured basis. No more than
19 one rate filing may be made by an insurer pursuant to the expedited process provided in this
20 subsection during any twelve (12) month period, unless a rate filing, when combined with any other
21 rate filing or filings made by an insurer within the preceding twelve (12) months, does not result in
22 an overall statewide increase or decrease of more than five percent (5%) in the aggregate for all
23 coverages that are subject to the filing.
24 (b) Rate filings falling outside of the limitation provided for in subsection (a) of this section
25 shall be subject to § 27-6-11, unless those filings are other otherwise exempt from those provisions
26 pursuant to another section of the insurance code.
27 (c) A filing submitted pursuant to subsection (a) of this section is considered to comply
28 with state law. However, if the commissioner of insurance determines that the filing is inadequate
29 or unfairly discriminatory, he/she shall issue a written order specifying in detail the provisions of
30 the insurance code the insurer has violated and the reasons the filing is inadequate or unfairly
31 discriminatory and stating a reasonable future date on which the filing is to be considered no longer
32 effective. An order by the commissioner pursuant to this subsection that is issued more than thirty
33 (30) days from the date on which the commissioner received the rate filing is prospective only and
34 does not affect any contract issued or made before the effective date of the order. For purposes of
LC002933/SUB A - Page 41 of 126
1 this act, “unfairly discriminatory” means a rate for a risk that is classified in whole or in part on the
2 basis of race, color, creed or national origin.
3 (d) No rate increase within the limitation specified in subsection (a) of this section may be
4 implemented with regard to an individual existing policy, unless the increase is applied at the time
5 of a renewal or conditional renewal of an existing policy and the insurer, at least thirty (30) days in
6 advance of the end of the insured’s policy period, mails or delivers to the named insured, at the
7 address shown in the policy, a written notice that clearly and conspicuously discloses its intention
8 to change the rate. A notice of renewal or conditional renewal that clearly and conspicuously
9 discloses the renewal premium applicable to the policy shall be deemed to be in compliance with
10 this subsection.
11 27-6-53. Use of credit rating.
12 (a) An insurer may use insurance scoring for rating and underwriting of homeowners’
13 insurance only under the following conditions:
14 (1) The insurer demonstrates the predictive nature of their insurance score to the insurance
15 division.
16 (2) An insurer shall, once every two (2) years if requested by an existing customer, obtain
17 an updated insurance score for the customer. If, after obtaining the insurance score, the customer
18 has improved his, her or its credit rating, the user of the information shall afford the customer any
19 decrease in rates that are available due to the improved rating. The user may not increase the rate
20 of an existing customer based solely on a worsening in the customer’s insurance score unless: (i)
21 the worsening is due to a bankruptcy, tax lien, garnishment, foreclosure or judgment; or (ii) if a
22 subsequent insurance score no sooner than six (6) months later confirms the worsening in score.
23 Should an existing customer’s score change as the result of an updated credit report, the decrease
24 or increase in rates must be done at renewal subject to conditions established herein.
25 (3) An insurer shall not decline insurance for a new customer based solely on an insurance
26 score, or absence of an insurance score; and an insurer shall not cancel, nonrenew or increase the
27 rate of an existing customer based solely on a worsening in a customer’s insurance score unless: (i)
28 the worsening is due to a bankruptcy, tax lien, garnishment, foreclosure or judgment; or (ii) if a
29 subsequent insurance score no sooner than six (6) months later confirms the worsening in score.
30 Should an existing customer’s score change as the result of an updated credit report, the decrease
31 or increase in rates must be done at renewal subject to conditions established herein.
32 (4) No insurer is obligated to obtain a current credit report or insurance score for an insured
33 if: the insured is in the most favorably-priced tier of the insurer, within a group of affiliated insures
34 insurers; or credit was not used for the insured when the policy was initially written. However, the
LC002933/SUB A - Page 42 of 126
1 insurer shall have the discretion to use credit for the insured upon renewal, if consistent with its
2 underwriting guidelines. The user may not increase the rate of an existing customer based solely
3 on a worsening in the customer’s insurance score unless: (i) the worsening is due to a bankruptcy,
4 tax lien, garnishment, foreclosure or judgment; or (ii) if a subsequent insurance score no sooner
5 than six (6) months later confirms the worsening in score. Should an existing customer’s score
6 change as the result of an updated credit report, the decrease or increase in rates must be done at
7 renewal subject to conditions established herein.
8 (5) If a credit bureau determines that disputed information is inaccurate or incorrect and
9 that information was used in determining an insurance score which resulted in a denial, cancellation
10 or nonrenewal of or higher premiums or less favorable policy terms for a consumer, the insurer
11 shall, within thirty (30) days of receiving notice of correction, reissue or re-rate the policy by
12 refunding the amount of the overpayment of premium based on the corrected insurance score
13 retroactive to the shorter of the last twelve (12) months of coverage or the actual period of coverage.
14 An “insurance score” as used in this section shall be defined as a number or rating that is derived
15 from an algorithm, computer application, model or other process that is based in whole or in part
16 on credit history.
17 (b) Agents shall be held harmless by insurers for all acts, efforts and disclosures in
18 obtaining an insurance score on the insurer’s behalf. The commissioner is authorized and
19 empowered to establish rules and regulations to carry out the provisions of this section and to fulfill
20 the goals of this section.
21 (c) Notwithstanding the above, an insurer authorized to do business in Rhode Island that
22 uses credit information to underwrite or rate risks, shall not use the following as a negative factor
23 in any insurance scoring methodology or in reviewing credit information for the purpose of
24 underwriting or rating a policy of personal insurance:
25 (1) Credit inquiries not initiated by the consumer or inquiries requested by the consumer
26 for his or her own credit information;
27 (2) Inquiries relating to insurance coverage, if so identified on a consumer’s credit report;
28 (3) Collection accounts with a medical industry code, if so identified on the consumer’s
29 credit report;
30 (4) Multiple lender inquiries, if coded by the consumer reporting agency on the consumer’s
31 credit report as being from the home mortgage industry and made within thirty (30) days of one
32 another, unless only one inquiry is considered;
33 (5) Multiple lender inquiries, if coded by the consumer reporting agency on the consumer’s
34 credit report as being from the automobile lending industry and made within thirty (30) days of one
LC002933/SUB A - Page 43 of 126
1 another, unless only one inquiry is considered.
2 (d) No consumer reporting agency shall provide or sell data or lists that include any
3 information that in whole or in part was submitted in conjunction with an insurance inquiry about
4 a consumer’s credit information or a request for a credit report or insurance score. Such information
5 includes, but is not limited to, the expiration dates of an insurance policy or any other information
6 that may identify time periods during which a consumer’s insurance may expire and the terms and
7 conditions of the consumer’s insurance coverage.
8 (e) The restrictions provided in subsection (d) of this section do not apply to data or lists
9 the consumer reporting agency supplies to the insurance [agent/producer] from whom information
10 was received, the insurer on whose behalf such [agent/producer] acted, or such insurer’s affiliates
11 or holding companies.
12 (f) Nothing in this section shall be construed to restrict any insurer from being able to obtain
13 a claims history report or a motor vehicle report.

32 SECTION 13. Section 27-14.3-32 of the General Laws in Chapter 27-14.3 entitled
33 "Insurers’ Rehabilitation and Liquidation Act" is hereby amended to read as follows:
34 27-14.3-32. Voidable preferences and liens.
LC002933/SUB A - Page 47 of 126
1 (a)(1) A preference is a transfer of any of the property of an insurer to or for the benefit of
2 a creditor, for or on account of an antecedent debt, made or suffered by the insurer within one year
3 before the filing of a successful petition for liquidation under this chapter, the effect of which
4 transfer may be to enable the creditor to obtain a greater percentage of this debt than another
5 creditor of the same class would receive. If a liquidation order is entered while the insurer is already
6 subject to a rehabilitation order, then the transfers shall be deemed preferences if made or suffered
7 within one year before the filing of the successful petition for rehabilitation, or within two (2) years
8 before the filing of the successful petition for liquidation, whichever time is shorter.
9 (2) Any preference may be avoided by the liquidator if:
10 (i) The insurer was insolvent at the time of the transfer;
11 (ii) The transfer was made within four (4) months before the filing of the petition;
12 (iii) The creditor receiving it or to be benefited by it or his or her agent acting with reference
13 to it had, at the time when the transfer was made, reasonable cause to believe that the insurer was
14 insolvent or was about to become insolvent; or
15 (iv) The creditor receiving it was an officer, or any employee or attorney or other person
16 who was in fact in a position of comparable influence in the insurer to an officer whether or not he
17 or she held the petition position, or any shareholder holding directly or indirectly more than five
18 percent (5%) of any class of any equity security issued by the insurer, or any other person, firm,
19 corporation, association, or aggregation of persons with whom the insurer did not deal at arm’s
20 length.
21 (3) Where the preference is voidable, the liquidator may recover the property or, if it has
22 been converted, its value from any person who has received or converted the property; provided,
23 that where a bona fide purchaser or lienor has given less than fair equivalent value, he or she shall
24 have a lien upon the property to the extent of the consideration actually given by him or her. Where
25 a preference by way of lien or security title is voidable, the court may on due notice order the lien
26 or title preserved for the benefit of the estate, in the event the lien or title shall pass to the liquidator.
27 (4) Notwithstanding subsection (a)(2) of this section, or any other provision of this chapter,
28 no receiver or any other person shall avoid any preference arising under or in connection with any
29 pledge, security, credit, collateral, loan, advances, reimbursement or guarantee agreement or
30 arrangement or any similar agreement, arrangement, or other credit enhancement to which a federal
31 home loan bank, as defined in § 27-14.3-5, is a party.
32 (b)(1) A transfer of property other than real property shall be deemed made or suffered
33 when it becomes so far perfected that no subsequent lien obtainable by legal or equitable
34 proceedings on a simple contract could become superior to the rights of the transferee.
LC002933/SUB A - Page 48 of 126
1 (2) A transfer of real property shall be deemed made or suffered when it becomes so far
2 perfected that no subsequent bona fide purchaser from the insurer could obtain rights superior to
3 the rights of the transferee.
4 (3) A transfer which creates an equitable lien shall not be deemed perfected if there are
5 available means by which a legal lien could be created.
6 (4) A transfer not perfected prior to the filing of a petition for liquidation shall be deemed
7 made immediately before the filing of the successful petition.
8 (5) The provisions of this subsection apply whether or not there are or were creditors who
9 might have obtained liens or persons who might have become bona fide purchasers.
10 (c)(1) A lien obtainable by legal or equitable proceedings upon a simple contract is one
11 arising in the ordinary course of the proceedings upon the entry or docketing of a judgment or
12 decree, or upon attachment, garnishment, execution, or a similar process, whether before, upon, or
13 after judgment or decree and whether before or upon levy. It does not include liens that under
14 applicable law are given a special priority over other liens which are prior in time.
15 (2) A lien obtainable by legal or equitable proceedings could become superior to the rights
16 of a transferee or a purchaser could obtain rights superior to the rights of a transferee, within the
17 meaning of subsection (b) of this section, if the consequences would follow only from the lien or
18 purchase itself, or from the lien or purchase followed by any step wholly within the control of the
19 lienholder or purchaser, with or without the aid of ministerial action by public officials. That lien
20 could not become superior and that purchase could not create superior rights for the purpose of
21 subsection (b) of this section through any acts subsequent to the obtaining of the lien or subsequent
22 to the purchase which require the agreement or concurrence of any third party or which require any
23 further judicial action or ruling.
24 (d) A transfer of property for or on account of a new and contemporaneous consideration
25 which is deemed under subsection (b) of this section made or suffered after the transfer because of
26 delay in perfecting it does not by this become a transfer for or on account of an antecedent debt if
27 any acts required by the applicable law to be performed in order to perfect the transfer as against
28 liens or bona fide purchasers’ rights are performed within twenty-one (21) days or any period
29 expressly allowed by the law, whichever is less. A transfer to secure a future loan, if the loan is
30 actually made, or a transfer, which becomes security for a future loan, shall have the same effect
31 as a transfer for or on account of a new and contemporaneous consideration.
32 (e) If any lien deemed voidable under subdivision (a)(2) of this section has been dissolved
33 by the furnishing of a bond or other obligation, the surety on which has been indemnified directly
34 or indirectly by the transfer of or the creation of a lien upon any property of an insurer before the
LC002933/SUB A - Page 49 of 126
1 filing of a petition under this chapter which results in a liquidation order, the indemnifying transfer
2 or lien shall also be deemed voidable.
3 (f) The property affected by any lien deemed voidable under subsections (a) and (e) of this
4 section shall be discharged from the lien, and that property and any of the indemnifying property
5 transferred to or for the benefit of a surety shall pass to the liquidator, except that the court may on
6 due notice order any lien preserved for the benefit of the estate and the court may direct that
7 conveyance executed as may be proper or adequate to evidence the title of the liquidator.
8 (g) The superior court for the county of Providence shall have summary jurisdiction of any
9 proceeding by the liquidator to hear and determine the rights of any parties under this section.
10 Reasonable notice of any hearing in the proceeding shall be given to all parties in interest, including
11 the obligee of a releasing bond or other similar obligation. Where an order is entered for the
12 recovery of indemnifying property in kind or for the avoidance of an indemnifying lien the court,
13 upon application of any party in interest, shall in the same proceeding ascertain the value of the
14 property or lien, and if the value is less than the amount for which the property is indemnity or than
15 the amount of the lien, the transferee or lienholder may elect to retain the property or lien upon
16 payment of its value, as ascertained by the court, to the liquidator, within any reasonable times as
17 the court shall fix.
18 (h) The liability of the surety under a releasing bond or other similar obligation shall be
19 discharged to the extent of the value of the indemnifying property recovered or the indemnifying
20 lien nullified and avoided by the liquidator, or where the property is retained under subsection (g)
21 of this section to the extent of the amount paid to the liquidator.
22 (i) If a creditor has been preferred, and afterward in good faith gives the insurer further
23 credit without security of any kind for property which becomes a part of the insurer’s estate, the
24 amount of the new credit remaining unpaid at the time of the petition may be set off against the
25 preference which would be recoverable from him or her.
26 (j) If an insurer, directly or indirectly, within one year before the filing of a successful
27 petition for liquidation under this chapter, or at any time in contemplation of a proceeding to
28 liquidate it, pays money or transfers property to an attorney at law for services rendered or to be
29 rendered, the transactions may be examined by the court on its own motion or shall be examined
30 by the court on petition of the liquidator and shall be held valid only to the extent of a reasonable
31 amount to be determined by the court, and the excess may be recovered by the liquidator for the
32 benefits of the estate; provided, that where the attorney is in a position of influence in the insurer
33 or an affiliate of the insurer, payment of any money or the transfer of any property to the attorney
34 at law for services rendered or to be rendered shall be governed by the provision of subdivision
LC002933/SUB A - Page 50 of 126
1 (a)(2)(iv) of this section.
2 (k)(1) Every officer, manager, employee, shareholder, member, subscriber, attorney, or any
3 other person acting on behalf of the insurer who knowingly participates in giving any preference
4 when he or she has reasonable cause to believe the insurer is or is about to become insolvent at the
5 time of the preference shall be personally liable to the liquidator for the amount of the preference.
6 It is permissible to infer that there is a reasonable cause to believe this if the transfer was made
7 within four (4) months before the date of filing of this successful petition for liquidation.
8 (2) Every person receiving any property from the insurer or the benefit of the property as
9 a preference voidable under subsection (a) of this section shall be personally liable for it and shall
10 be bound to account to the liquidator.
11 (3) Nothing in this subsection shall prejudice any other claim by the liquidator against any
12 person.

14 and Sickness Insurance Policies" is hereby amended to read as follows:

21 not be denied because of race, color, or creed, nor shall any insurer make or permit any unfair
22 discrimination against particular individuals or persons licensed under chapters 29, 30, 35 35.1 and
23 37 of title 5.

8 hereby amended to read as follows:
9 16-7-22. Determination of average daily membership.
10 Each community shall be paid pursuant to the provisions of § 16-7-17 an amount based
11 upon the following provisions:
12 (1) On or before September 1 of each year the average daily membership of each city and
13 town for the reference year shall be determined by the commissioner of elementary and secondary
14 education from data supplied by the school committee in each community in the following manner:
15 The aggregate number of days of membership of all pupils enrolled full time in grade twelve (12)
16 and below, except that pupils below grade one who are not full time shall be counted on a full-time
17 equivalent basis: (i) Increased by the aggregate number of days of membership of pupils residing
18 in the particular city or town whose tuition in schools approved by the department of elementary
19 and secondary education in other cities and towns is paid by the particular city or town; and (ii)
20 Decreased by the aggregate number of days of membership of nonresident pupils enrolled in the
21 public schools of the particular city or town and further decreased by the aggregate number of days
22 of membership equal to the number of group home beds calculated for the purposes of
23 reimbursement pursuant to § 16-64-1.1; and (iii) Decreased further, in the case of a city or town
24 that is a member of a regional school district during the first year of operation of the regional school
25 district by the aggregate number of days of membership of pupils residing in the city or town who
26 would have attended the public schools in the regional school district if the regional school district
27 had been operating during the previous year, divided by the number of days during which the
28 schools were officially in session during the reference year. The resulting figures shall be the
29 average daily membership for the city or town for the reference year. For purposes of calculating
30 the permanent foundation education aid as described in §§ 16-7.2-3(a)(1) and 16-7.2-3(a)(2), the
31 average daily membership for school districts shall exclude charter school and state school students,
32 and beginning in school year 2014-2015, include an estimate to ensure that districts converting
33 from a half-day to a full-day kindergarten program pursuant to § 16-99-4 are credited on a full-time
34 basis beginning in the first year of enrollment and are funded notwithstanding the transition plan
LC002933/SUB A - Page 92 of 126
1 pursuant to § 16-7.2-7.
2 (2) The average daily membership of pupils attending public schools shall apply for the
3 purposes of determining the percentage of the state’s share under the provisions of §§ 16-7-16(3),
4 16-7-16(10), 16-7-18, 16-7-19, 16-7-20, 16-7-21, and 16-7.2-4.
5 (3) In the case of regional school districts, the aggregate number of days of membership by
6 which each city or town is decreased in subsection (1)(iii) of this section, divided by the number of
7 days during which the schools attended by the pupils were officially in session, shall determine the
8 average daily membership for the regional school district during the first year of operation. After
9 the first year of operation, the average daily membership of each regional school district, except
10 the Chariho regional high school district, shall be determined by the commissioner of elementary
11 and secondary education from data supplied by the school committee of each regional school
12 district for the reference year in the manner provided in subsection (1) of this section.
13 (4) For all fiscal years beginning after June 30, 2024, notwithstanding subsection (1)(ii)
14 above, the decrease for group home beds shall not apply to residential facility “beds” located or
15 associated with the CRAFT program pursuant to § 16-64-1.1.

12 apprentice training program.
13 (2) The program standards contain the equal opportunity pledge prescribed in 29 C.F.R §
14 30.3(c) and, when applicable, an affirmative action plan in accordance with 29 C.F.R. § 30.4, a
15 selection method authorized in 29 C.F.R § 30.10, or similar requirements expressed in a state plan

2 time, place, and conditions of the duty performed by the member that resulted in the alleged
3 disability and that the alleged disability was not the result of the willful negligence or misconduct
4 on the part of the member, and was not the result of age or length of service. The application shall
5 be made within eighteen (18) months of the alleged accident from which the injury has resulted in
6 the member’s present disability and shall be accompanied by an accident report and a physician’s
7 report certifying to the disability. If the member was able to return to his or her employment and
8 subsequently reinjures or aggravates the same injury or illness, the member shall make another
9 application within eighteen (18) months of the reinjury or aggravation that shall be accompanied
10 by a physician’s report certifying to the reinjury or aggravation causing the disability. If a medical
11 examination made by three (3) physicians engaged by the retirement board, and other investigations
12 as the board may make, confirms the statements made by the member, the board may grant the
13 member an accidental disability retirement allowance.
14 (b) For the purposes of subsection (a), “aggravation” shall mean an intervening work-
15 related trauma that independently contributes to a member’s original injury or illness that amounts
16 to more than the natural progression of the preexisting disease or condition and is not the result of
17 age or length of service. The intervening independent trauma causing the aggravation must be an
18 identifiable event or series of work-related events that are the proximate cause of the member’s
19 present condition of disability.
20 (c) “Occupational cancer,” as used in this section, means a cancer arising out of
21 employment as a firefighter, due to injury or illness due to exposures to smoke, fumes, or
22 carcinogenic, poisonous, toxic, or chemical substances while in the performance of active duty in
23 the fire department.
24 (d) For purposes of subsection (a), “reinjury” shall mean a recurrence of the original work-
25 related injury or illness from a specific ascertainable event. The specific event must be the
26 proximate cause of the member’s present condition of disability.
27 (e) Any firefighter, including one employed by the state, or a municipal firefighter
28 employed by a municipality that participates in the optional retirement for police officers and
29 firefighters as provided in this chapter, who is unable to perform his or her duties in the fire
30 department by reason of a disabling occupational cancer (as defined in §§ 45-19.1-2 and 45-19.1-
31 4) that develops or manifests itself during a period while the firefighter is in the service of the
32 department, and any retired member of the fire force of any city or town who develops occupational
33 cancer (as defined in §§ 45-19.1-2 and 45-19.1-4), is entitled to receive an occupational cancer
34 disability and he or she is entitled to all of the benefits provided for in this chapter, chapters 19,
LC002933/SUB A - Page 123 of 126
1 19.1, and 21 of this title, and chapter 10 of title 36 if the firefighter is employed by the state.
2 (f) Any police officer or firefighter as defined in §§ 45-19-1(b) and (c) who is unable to
3 perform their duties by reason of post-traumatic stress injury/PTSD as set forth in § 45-19-1(a)(2)
4 is entitled to receive an accidental disability retirement allowance and the police officer or
5 firefighter is entitled to all of the benefits provided for in this chapter (including the presumption
6 set forth in subsection (a)(2) of this section § 45-19-1(a)(2)), chapters 19, 19.1, and 21 of this title,
7 and chapter 10 of title 36 if the firefighter is employed by the state.
8 (g) In the event that any party is aggrieved by the determination of the retirement board
9 pursuant to § 45-19-1, for an injury or illness occurring on or after July 1, 2011, the party may
10 submit an appeal to the Rhode Island workers’ compensation court. The appellant shall file a notice
11 of appeal with the retirement board and with the workers’ compensation court within twenty (20)
12 days of the entry of the retirement board’s decision and shall serve a copy of the notice of appeal
13 upon the opposing party.
14 (h) Within twenty (20) days of the receipt of the notice of appeal, the retirement board shall
15 transmit the entire record of proceedings before it, together with its order, to the workers’
16 compensation court.
17 (i) In the event that a party files a notice of appeal to the workers’ compensation court, the
18 order of the retirement board shall be stayed pending further action by the court pursuant to the
19 provisions of § 28-35-20.
20 (j) Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the court shall assign the matter to a judge and
21 shall issue a notice at the time advising the parties of the judge to whom the case has been assigned
22 and the date for pretrial conference in accordance with § 28-35-20.
23 (k) All proceedings filed with the workers’ compensation court pursuant to this section
24 shall be de novo and shall be subject to the provisions of chapters 29 — 38 of title 28 for all case
25 management procedures and dispute resolution processes, as provided under the rules of the
26 workers’ compensation court. The workers’ compensation court shall enter a pretrial order in
27 accordance with § 28-35-20(c) that grants or denies, in whole or in part, the relief sought by the
28 petitioner. The pretrial order shall be effective upon entry and any payments ordered by it shall be
29 paid within fourteen (14) days of the entry of the order. Provided, however, that in the event that
30 the retirement board files a claim for trial of the pretrial order entered by the court, the order of the
31 court shall be stayed until a final order or decree is entered by the court. If after trial and the entry
32 of a final decree the court sustains the findings and orders entered in the pretrial order, the
33 retirement board shall reimburse the municipality all benefits paid by it from the time the pretrial
34 order was entered until the time the final decree is entered by the court. Where the matter has been
LC002933/SUB A - Page 124 of 126
1 heard and decided by the workers’ compensation court, the court shall retain jurisdiction to review
2 any prior orders or decrees entered by it. The petitions to review shall be filed directly with the
3 workers’ compensation court and shall be subject to the case management and dispute resolution
4 procedures set forth in chapters 29 — 38 of title 28 (“Labor and Labor Relations”).
5 (l) If the court determines that a member qualifies for accidental disability retirement, the
6 member shall receive a retirement allowance equal to sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66⅔%) of
7 the rate of the member’s compensation at the date of the member’s retirement, subject to the
8 provisions of § 45-21-31.
9 (m) If the court determines that a member does not qualify for accidental disability
10 retirement, and after all appeals have been exhausted by the member (i.e., appeals to the workers’
11 compensation appellate division and the Rhode Island supreme court), said member shall have
12 twenty (20) days within which to either:
13 (1) File an application for ordinary disability retirement pursuant to § 45-21.2-7; however,
14 if the member does not have the requisite time on the job to file such application, then the
15 participating municipality shall continue to consider the member injured on duty pursuant to § 45-
16 19-1 until such time that the member has the necessary time on the job to file the application for an
17 ordinary disability retirement; or
18 (2) File an application for a service retirement pursuant to § 45-21.2-5; or
19 (3) Return to duty provided the member has received medical clearance to perform those
20 duties.
21 Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit the member from making an agreement with the
22 member’s participating municipality as to what options and benefits the member may be entitled
23 to in lieu of the options and benefits set forth in this subsection. In addition, nothing in this
24 subsection shall prohibit the member’s bargaining unit and participating municipality from entering
25 into a collective bargaining agreement that addresses the issues in this subsection.

IN GENERAL ASSEMBLY
JANUARY SESSION, A.D. 2025
____________
A N A C T
RELATING TO STATUTES AND STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION
Introduced By: Representative Christopher R. Blazejewski
Date Introduced: June 04, 2025
Referred To: House Judiciary
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 ARTICLE I--STATUTORY REENACTMENT
2 SECTION 1. It is the express intention of the General Assembly to reenact the entirety of
3 Title 25, chapters 1 through 18.9 of Title 27, and chapters 1 through 46 of Title 42 of the General
4 Laws of Rhode Island, including every chapter and section therein, and any chapters and sections
5 thereof not included in this act may be, and are hereby, reenacted as if fully set forth herein.
6 SECTION 2. Sections 27-1-46 and 27-1-47 of the General Laws in Chapter 27-1 entitled
7 "Domestic Insurance Companies" are hereby amended to read as follows:
8 27-1-46. Information security program.
9 (a) Commensurate with the size and complexity of an insurer, the nature and scope of an
10 insurer’s activities, including its use of third-party service providers, and the sensitivity of the
11 nonpublic information used by the insurer or in the insurer’s possession, custody, or control, each
12 domestic insurance company shall develop, implement, and maintain a comprehensive written
13 information security program, based on the insurer’s risk assessment and that contains
14 administrative, technical, and physical safeguards for the protection of nonpublic information and
15 the insurer’s information system. For purposes of this chapter, “information security program”
16 means the administrative, technical, and physical safeguards that an insurer uses to access, collect,
17 distribute, process, protect, store, use, transmit, dispose of, or otherwise handle, nonpublic
18 information. “Publicly available information” means any information that a licensee has a

1 reasonable basis to believe is lawfully made available to the general public from: federal, state, or
2 local government records; widely distributed media; or disclosures to the general public that are
3 required to be made by federal, state, or local law. “Nonpublic information” means information
4 that is not publicly available information and is:
5 (1) Business-related information of a licensee, the tampering with which, or unauthorized
6 disclosure, access, or use of which, would cause a material adverse impact to the business,
7 operations, or security of the licensee;
8 (2) Any information concerning a consumer which, because of name, number, personal
9 mark, or other identifier, can be used to identify such consumer, in combination with any one or
10 more of the following data elements:
11 (i) Social security number;
12 (ii) Driver’s license number or non-driver identification card number;
13 (iii) Account number, credit, or debit card number;
14 (iv) Any security code, access code, or password that would permit access to a consumer’s
15 financial account; or
16 (v) Biometric records;
17 (3) Any information or data, except age or gender, in any form or medium created by or
18 derived from a healthcare provider or a consumer and that relates to:
19 (i) The past, present, or future physical, mental, behavioral health, or medical condition of
20 any consumer or a member of the consumer’s family;
21 (ii) The provision of health care to any consumer; or
22 (iii) Payment for the provision of health care to any consumer.
23 (b) Objectives of information security program. An insurer’s information security
24 program shall be designed to:
25 (1) Protect the security and confidentiality of nonpublic information and the security of the
26 information system;
27 (2) Protect against any threats or hazards to the security or integrity of nonpublic
28 information and the information system;
29 (3) Protect against unauthorized access to or use of nonpublic information, and minimize
30 the likelihood of harm to any consumer. For purposes of this section, “consumer” means an
31 individual, including, but not limited to, applicants, policyholders, insureds, beneficiaries,
32 claimants, and certificate holders, who is a resident of this state and whose nonpublic information
33 is in an insurer’s possession, custody, or control; and
34 (4) Define and periodically reevaluate a schedule for retention of nonpublic information
LC002933/SUB A - Page 2 of 126

1 and a mechanism for its destruction when no longer needed.
2 (c) Risk assessment. The insurer shall:
3 (1) Designate one or more employees, an affiliate, or an outside vendor designated to act
4 on behalf of the insurer who is responsible for the information security program;
5 (2) Identify reasonably foreseeable internal or external threats that could result in
6 unauthorized access, transmission, disclosure, misuse, alteration, or destruction of nonpublic
7 information, including the security of information systems and nonpublic information that are
8 accessible to, or held by, third-party service providers. “Third-party service providers” means a
9 person, not otherwise defined as a licensee, that contracts with a licensee to maintain, process, store,
10 or otherwise is permitted access to nonpublic information through its provision of services to the
11 licensee. Third-party service providers does not include licensed insurance producers;
12 (3) Assess the likelihood and potential damage of these threats, taking into consideration
13 the sensitivity of the nonpublic information;
14 (4) Assess the sufficiency of policies, procedures, information systems, and other
15 safeguards in place to manage these threats, including consideration of threats in each relevant area
16 of the insurer’s operations, including:
17 (i) Employee training and management;
18 (ii) Information systems, including network and software design, as well as information
19 classification, governance, processing, storage, transmission, and disposal; and
20 (iii) Detecting, preventing, and responding to attacks, intrusions, or other systems failures;
21 and
22 (5) Implement information safeguards to manage the threats identified in its ongoing
23 assessment, and no less than annually, assess the effectiveness of the safeguards’ key controls,
24 systems, and procedures.
25 (d) Risk management. Based on its risk assessment, the insurer shall:
26 (1) Design its information security program to mitigate the identified risks, commensurate
27 with the size and complexity of the insurer’s activities, including its use of third-party service
28 providers, and the sensitivity of the nonpublic information used by the insurer or in the insurer’s
29 possession, custody, or control;
30 (2) Determine which security measures listed below are appropriate and implement such
31 security measures:
32 (i) Place access controls on information systems, including controls to authenticate and
33 permit access only to authorized individuals to protect against the unauthorized acquisition of
34 nonpublic information. “Authorized individual” means an individual known to and screened by the
LC002933/SUB A - Page 3 of 126

1 insurer, and determined to be necessary and appropriate to have access to the nonpublic information
2 held by the insurer, and the insurer’s information systems;
3 (ii) Identify and manage the data, personnel, devices, systems, and facilities that enable the
4 organization to achieve business purposes in accordance with their relative importance to business
5 objectives and the organization’s risk strategy;
6 (iii) Restrict access at physical locations containing nonpublic information only to
7 authorized individuals;
8 (iv) Protect, by encryption or other appropriate means, all nonpublic information while
9 being transmitted over an external network and all nonpublic information stored on a laptop
10 computer or other portable computing or storage device or media;
11 (v) Adopt secure development practices for in-house developed applications utilized by the
12 insurer and procedures for evaluating, assessing, or testing the security of externally developed
13 applications utilized by the insurer;
14 (vi) Modify the information system in accordance with the insurer’s information security
15 program;
16 (vii) Utilize effective controls, which may include multi-factor authentication procedures
17 for any individual accessing nonpublic information;
18 (viii) Regularly test and monitor systems and procedures to detect actual and attempted
19 attacks on, or intrusions into, information systems;
20 (ix) Include audit trails within the information security program designed to detect and
21 respond to cybersecurity events and designed to reconstruct material financial transactions
22 sufficient to support normal operations and obligations of the insurer;
23 (x) Implement measures to protect against destruction, loss, or damage of nonpublic
24 information due to environmental hazards, such as fire and water damage or other catastrophes or
25 technological failures; and
26 (xi) Develop, implement, and maintain procedures for the secure disposal of nonpublic
27 information in any format;
28 (3) Include cybersecurity risks in the insurer’s enterprise risk management process;
29 (4) Stay informed regarding emerging threats or vulnerabilities and utilize reasonable
30 security measures when sharing information relative to the character of the sharing and the type of
31 information shared; and
32 (5) Provide its personnel with cybersecurity awareness training that is updated as necessary
33 to reflect risks identified by the insurer in the risk assessment.
34 (e) Oversight by board of directors. If the insurer has a board of directors, the board or
LC002933/SUB A - Page 4 of 126

1 an appropriate committee of the board shall, at a minimum:
2 (1) Require the insurer’s executive management or its designees to develop, implement,
3 and maintain the insurer’s information security program;
4 (2) Require the insurer’s executive management or its designees to report in writing at least
5 annually, the following information:
6 (i) The overall status of the information security program and the insurer’s compliance with
7 this chapter; and
8 (ii) Material matters related to the information security program, addressing issues such as
9 risk assessment, risk management and control decisions, third-party service provider arrangements,
10 results of testing, cybersecurity events or violations and management’s responses thereto, or
11 recommendations for changes in the information security program; and
12 (3) If executive management delegates any of its responsibilities pursuant to this section,
13 it shall oversee the development, implementation, and maintenance of the insurer’s information
14 security program prepared by the designee(s) and shall receive a report from the designee(s)
15 complying with the requirements of the report to the board of directors.
16 (f) Oversight of third-party service provider arrangements.
17 (1) An insurer shall exercise due diligence in selecting its third-party service provider; and
18 (2) An insurer shall take reasonable steps to request a third-party service provider to
19 implement appropriate administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect and secure the
20 information systems and nonpublic information that are accessible to, or held by, the third-party
21 service provider.
22 (g) Program adjustments. The insurer shall monitor, evaluate, and adjust, as appropriate,
23 the information security program consistent with any relevant changes in technology, the sensitivity
24 of its nonpublic information, internal or external threats to information, and the insurer’s own
25 changing business arrangements, such as mergers and acquisitions, alliances and joint ventures,
26 outsourcing arrangements, and changes to information systems.
27 (h) Incident response plan.
28 (1) As part of its information security program, each insurer shall establish a written
29 incident response plan designed to promptly respond to, and recover from, any cybersecurity event
30 that compromises the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of nonpublic information in its
31 possession, the insurer’s information systems, or the continuing functionality of any aspect of the
32 insurer’s business or operations.
33 (2) Such incident response plan shall address the following areas:
34 (i) The internal process for responding to a cybersecurity event;
LC002933/SUB A - Page 5 of 126

1 (ii) The goals of the incident response plan;
2 (iii) The definition of clear roles, responsibilities, and levels of decision-making authority;
3 (iv) External and internal communications and information sharing;
4 (v) Identification of requirements for the remediation of any identified weaknesses in
5 information systems and associated controls;
6 (vi) Documentation and reporting regarding cybersecurity events and related incident
7 response activities; and
8 (vii) The evaluation and revision as necessary of the incident response plan following a
9 cybersecurity event.
10 (3) If the insurer learns that a cybersecurity event has or may have occurred, the insurer, or
11 an outside vendor and/or service provider designated to act on behalf of the insurer, shall conduct
12 a prompt investigation. For purposes of this section, “cybersecurity event” means an event resulting
13 in unauthorized access to, disruption or misuse of an information system or nonpublic information
14 stored on such information system. This does not include the unauthorized acquisition of encrypted
15 nonpublic information if the encryption, process, or key is not also acquired, released, or used
16 without authorization. This also does not include an event with regard to which the insurer has
17 determined that the nonpublic information accessed by an unauthorized person has not been used
18 or released and has been returned or destroyed.
19 (i) During the investigation, the insurer, or an outside vendor and/or service provider
20 designated to act on behalf of the insurer, shall, at a minimum, determine as much of the following
21 information as possible:
22 (A) Whether a cybersecurity event has occurred;
23 (B) Assess the nature and scope of the cybersecurity event;
24 (C) Identify any nonpublic information that may have been involved in the cybersecurity
25 event; and
26 (D) Perform or oversee reasonable measures to restore the security of the information
27 systems compromised in the cybersecurity event in order to prevent further unauthorized
28 acquisition, release, or use of nonpublic information in the insurer’s possession, custody, or control.
29 (ii) If the insurer learns that a cybersecurity event has or may have occurred in a system
30 maintained by a third-party service provider, and it has or may have impacted the insurer’s
31 nonpublic information, the insurer shall make reasonable efforts to complete the steps set forth in
32 subsection (a) subsection (h)(3)(i) of this section or make reasonable efforts to confirm and
33 document that the third-party service provider has completed those steps.
34 (iii) The insurer shall maintain records concerning all cybersecurity events for a period of
LC002933/SUB A - Page 6 of 126

1 at least five (5) years from the date of the cybersecurity event. The insurer shall produce those
2 records upon demand of the commissioner pursuant to chapter 13.1 of this title or other statutory
3 authority.
4 (i) Annually, each insurer domiciled in this state shall submit to the commissioner a written
5 statement by April 15 certifying that the insurer is in compliance with the requirements set forth in
6 this section. Each insurer shall maintain for examination by the department all records, schedules,
7 and data supporting this certificate for a period of five (5) years. To the extent an insurer has

15 ARTICLED VII.
16 RULES AND OPERATING PROCEDURES: RULEMAKING FUNCTIONS OF THE
17 COMMISSION AND OPTING OUT OF UNIFORM STANDARDS
18 (1) Rulemaking authority. The commission shall promulgate reasonable rules, including
19 uniform standards, and operating procedures in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the
20 purposes of this compact. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the commission exercises its
21 rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this act, or the powers
22 granted hereunder, then such an action by the commission shall be invalid and have no force and
23 effect.
24 (2) Rulemaking procedure. Rules and operating procedures shall be made pursuant to a
25 rulemaking process that conforms to the Model State Administrative Procedure Act of 1981 as
26 amended, as may be appropriate to the operations of the commission. Before the commission adopts
27 a uniform standard, the commission shall give written notice to the relevant state legislative
28 committee(s) in each compacting state responsible for insurance issues of its intention to adopt the
29 uniform standard. The commission in adopting a uniform standard shall consider fully all submitted
30 materials and issue a concise explanation of its decision.
31 (3) Effective date and opt out of a uniform standard. A uniform standard shall become
32 effective ninety (90) days after its promulgation by the commission or such later date as the
33 commission may determine; provided, however, that a compacting state may opt out of a uniform
34 standard as provided in this Article. “Opt out” shall be defined as any action by a compacting state
LC002933/SUB A - Page 19 of 126

1 to decline to adopt or participate in a promulgated uniform standard. All other rules and operating
2 procedures, and amendments thereto, shall become effective as of the date specified in each rule,
3 operating procedure or amendment.
4 (4) Opt out procedure. A compacting state may opt out of a uniform standard, either by
5 legislation or regulation duly promulgated by the insurance department under the Compacting
6 State’s Administrative Procedure Act. If a compacting state elects to opt out of a uniform standard
7 by regulation, it must: (a) give written notice to the commission no later than ten (10) business days
8 after the uniform standard is promulgated, or at the time the state becomes a compacting state; and
9 (b) find that the uniform standard does not provide reasonable protections to the citizens of the
10 state, given the conditions in the state. The commissioner shall make specific findings of fact and
11 conclusions of law, based on a preponderance of the evidence, detailing the conditions in the state
12 which warrant a departure from the uniform standard and determining that the uniform standard
13 would not reasonably protect the citizens of the state. The commissioner must consider and balance
14 the following factors and find that the conditions in the state and needs of the citizens of the state
15 outweigh: (i) the intent of the legislature to participate in, and the benefits of, an interstate
16 agreement to establish national uniform consumer protections for the products subject to this act;
17 and (ii) the presumption that a uniform standard adopted by the commission provides reasonable
18 protections to consumers of the relevant product.
19 Notwithstanding the foregoing, a compacting state, may, at the time of its enactment of this
20 compact, prospectively opt out of all uniform standards involving long-term care insurance
21 products by expressly providing for such opt out in the enacted compact, and such an opt out shall
22 not be treated as a material variance in the offer or acceptance of any state to participate in this
23 compact. Such an opt out shall be effective at the time of enactment of this compact by the
24 compacting state and shall apply to all existing uniform standards involving long-term care
25 insurance products and those subsequently promulgated.
26 (5) Effect of opt out. If a compacting state elects to opt out of a uniform standard, the
27 uniform standard shall remain applicable in the compacting state electing to opt out until such time
28 the opt out legislation is enacted into law or the regulation opting out becomes effective.
29 Once the opt out of a uniform standard by a compacting state becomes effective as provided
30 under the laws of that state, the uniform standard shall have no further force and effect in that state
31 unless and until the legislation or regulation implementing the opt out is repealed or otherwise
32 becomes ineffective under the laws of the state. If a compacting state opts out of a uniform standard
33 after the uniform standard has been made effective in that state, the opt out shall have the same
34 prospective effect as provided under Article XIV for withdrawals.
LC002933/SUB A - Page 20 of 126

1 (6) Stay of uniform standard. If a compacting state has formally initiated the process of
2 opting out of a uniform standard by regulation, and while the regulatory opt out is pending, the
3 compacting state may petition the commission, at least fifteen (15) days before the effective date
4 of the uniform standard, to stay the effectiveness of the uniform standard in that state. The
5 commission may grant a stay if it determines the regulatory opt out is being pursued in a reasonable
6 manner and there is a likelihood of success. If a stay is granted or extended by the commission, the
7 stay or extension thereof may postpone the effective date by up to ninety (90) days, unless
8 affirmatively extended by the commission; provided, a stay may not be permitted to remain in
9 effect for more than one (1) year unless the compacting state can show extraordinary circumstances
10 which warrant a continuance of the stay, including, but not limited to, the existence of a legal
11 challenge which prevents the compacting state from opting out. A stay may be terminated by the
12 commission upon notice that the rulemaking process has been terminated.
13 (7) Not later than thirty (30) days after a rule or operating procedure is promulgated any
14 person may file a petition for judicial review of the rule or operating procedure; provided, that the
15 filing of such a petition shall not stay or otherwise prevent the rule or operating procedure from
16 becoming effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substantial likelihood of success.
17 The court shall give deference to the actions of the commission consistent with applicable law and
18 shall not find the rule or operating procedure to be unlawful if the rule or operating procedure
19 represents a reasonable exercise of the commission’s authority.
20 ARTICLE VIII.
21 COMMISSION RECORDS AND ENFORCEMENT
22 (1) The commission shall promulgate rules establishing conditions and procedures for
23 public inspection and copying of its information and official records, except such information and
24 records involving the privacy of individuals and insurers’ trade secrets. The commission may
25 promulgate additional rules under which it may make available to federal and state agencies
26 including law enforcement agencies, records and information otherwise exempt from disclosure
27 and may enter into agreements with such agencies to receive or exchange information or records
28 subject to nondisclosure and confidentiality provisions.
29 (2) Except as to privileged records, data and information, the laws of any compacting state
30 pertaining to confidentiality or nondisclosure shall not relieve any compacting state commissioner
31 of the duty to disclose any relevant records, data or information to the commission; provided, that
32 disclosure to the commission shall not be deemed to waive or otherwise affect any confidentiality
33 requirement; and further provided, that, except as otherwise expressly provided in this act, the
34 commission shall not be subject to the compacting state’s laws pertaining to confidentiality and
LC002933/SUB A - Page 21 of 126

2 information of the commission shall remain confidential after such information is provided to any

4 (3) The commission shall monitor compacting states for compliance with duly adopted
5 bylaws, rules, including uniform standards, and operating procedures. The commission shall notify
6 any noncomplying compacting state in writing of its noncompliance with commission bylaws, rules
7 or operating procedures. If a noncomplying compacting state fails to remedy its noncompliance
8 within the time specified in the notice of noncompliance, the compacting state shall be deemed to
9 be in default as set forth in Article XIV.
10 (4) The commissioner of any state in which an insurer is authorized to do business, or is
11 conducting the business of insurance, shall continue to exercise his or her authority to oversee the
12 market regulation of the activities of the insurer in accordance with the provisions of the state’s
13 law. The commissioner’s enforcement of compliance with the compact is governed by the state
14 following provisions:
15 (a) With respect to the commissioner’s market regulation of a product or advertisement
16 that is approved or certified to the commission, the content of the product or advertisement shall
17 not constitute a violation of the provisions, standards or requirements of the compact except upon
18 a final order of the commission, issued at the request of a commissioner after prior notice to the
19 insurer and an opportunity for hearing before the commission.
20 (b) Before a commissioner may bring an action for violation of any provision, standard or
21 requirement of the compact relating to the content of an advertisement not approved or certified to
22 the commission, the commission, or an authorized commission officer or employee, must authorize
23 the section action. However, authorization pursuant to this paragraph does not require notice to the
24 insurer, opportunity for hearing or disclosure of requests for authorization or records of the
25 commission’s action on such requests.
26 ARTICLE IX.
27 DISPUTE RESOLUTION
28 The commission shall attempt, upon the request of a member, to resolve any disputes or
29 other issues that are subject to this compact and which may arise between two (2) or more
30 compacting states, or between compacting states and noncompacting states, and the commission
31 shall promulgate an operating procedure providing for resolution of such disputes.

34 (1) Insurers and third-party filers seeking to have a product approved by the commission
LC002933/SUB A - Page 22 of 126

1 shall file the product with, and pay applicable filing fees to, the commission. Nothing in this act
2 shall be construed to restrict or otherwise prevent an insurer from filing its product with the
3 insurance department in any state wherein the insurer is licensed to conduct the business of
4 insurance, and such filing shall be subject to the laws of the states where filed.
5 (2) The commission shall establish appropriate filing and review processes and procedures
6 pursuant to commission rules and operating procedures. Notwithstanding any provision herein to
7 the contrary, the commission shall promulgate rules to establish conditions and procedures under
8 which the commission will provide public access to product filing information. In establishing such
9 rules, the commission shall consider the interests of the public in having access to such information,
10 as well as protection of personal medical and financial information and trade secrets, that may be
11 contained in a product filing or supporting information.
12 (3) Any product approved by the commission may be sold or otherwise issued in those
13 compacting states for which the insurer is legally authorized to do business.
14 ARTICLE XI.
15 REVIEW OF COMMISSION DECISIONS REGARDING FILINGS
16 (1) Not later than thirty (30) days after the commission has given notice of a disapproved
17 product or advertisement filed with the commission, the insurer or third party filer whose filing was
18 disapproved may appeal the determination to a review panel appointed by the commission. The
19 commission shall promulgate rules to establish procedures for appointing such review panels and
20 provide for notice and hearing. An allegation that the commission, in disapproving a product or
21 advertisement filed with the commission, acted arbitrarily, capriciously, or in a manner that is an
22 abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with the law, is subject to judicial review in
23 accordance with Article III, Section 5.
24 (2) The commission shall have authority to monitor, review and reconsider products and
25 advertisement subsequent to their filing or approval upon a finding that the product does not meet
26 the relevant uniform standard. Where appropriate, the commission may withdraw or modify its
27 approval after proper notice and hearing, subject to the appeal process in section 1 above.
28 ARTICLE XII.
29 FINANCE
30 (1) The commission shall pay or provide for the payment of the reasonable expenses of its
31 establishment and organization. To fund the cost of its initial operations, the commission may
32 accept contributions and other forms of funding from the National Association of Insurance
33 Commissioners, compacting states and other sources. Contributions and other forms of funding
34 from other sources shall be of such a nature that the independence of the commission concerning
LC002933/SUB A - Page 23 of 126

1 the performance of its duties shall not be compromised.
2 (2) The commission shall collect a filing fee from each insurer and third party filer filing a

14 procedures of the commission shall be audited annually by an independent certified public
15 accountant. Upon the determination of the commission, but no less frequently than every three (3)
16 years, the review of the independent auditor shall include a management and performance audit of

18 compacting states, which shall include a report of the independent audit. The commission’s internal
19 accounts shall not be confidential and such materials may be shared with the commissioner of any

13 made by an applicant for insurance relative to insurable interest of the applicant in the insured, and

25 shall be subject to § 27-6-11, unless those filings are other otherwise exempt from those provisions
26 pursuant to another section of the insurance code.
27 (c) A filing submitted pursuant to subsection (a) of this section is considered to comply
28 with state law. However, if the commissioner of insurance determines that the filing is inadequate
29 or unfairly discriminatory, he/she shall issue a written order specifying in detail the provisions of
30 the insurance code the insurer has violated and the reasons the filing is inadequate or unfairly
31 discriminatory and stating a reasonable future date on which the filing is to be considered no longer
32 effective. An order by the commissioner pursuant to this subsection that is issued more than thirty
33 (30) days from the date on which the commissioner received the rate filing is prospective only and
34 does not affect any contract issued or made before the effective date of the order. For purposes of
LC002933/SUB A - Page 41 of 126

1 this act, “unfairly discriminatory” means a rate for a risk that is classified in whole or in part on the
2 basis of race, color, creed or national origin.
3 (d) No rate increase within the limitation specified in subsection (a) of this section may be
4 implemented with regard to an individual existing policy, unless the increase is applied at the time
5 of a renewal or conditional renewal of an existing policy and the insurer, at least thirty (30) days in
6 advance of the end of the insured’s policy period, mails or delivers to the named insured, at the
7 address shown in the policy, a written notice that clearly and conspicuously discloses its intention
8 to change the rate. A notice of renewal or conditional renewal that clearly and conspicuously
9 discloses the renewal premium applicable to the policy shall be deemed to be in compliance with
10 this subsection.
11 27-6-53. Use of credit rating.
12 (a) An insurer may use insurance scoring for rating and underwriting of homeowners’
13 insurance only under the following conditions:
14 (1) The insurer demonstrates the predictive nature of their insurance score to the insurance
15 division.
16 (2) An insurer shall, once every two (2) years if requested by an existing customer, obtain
17 an updated insurance score for the customer. If, after obtaining the insurance score, the customer
18 has improved his, her or its credit rating, the user of the information shall afford the customer any
19 decrease in rates that are available due to the improved rating. The user may not increase the rate
20 of an existing customer based solely on a worsening in the customer’s insurance score unless: (i)
21 the worsening is due to a bankruptcy, tax lien, garnishment, foreclosure or judgment; or (ii) if a
22 subsequent insurance score no sooner than six (6) months later confirms the worsening in score.
23 Should an existing customer’s score change as the result of an updated credit report, the decrease
24 or increase in rates must be done at renewal subject to conditions established herein.
25 (3) An insurer shall not decline insurance for a new customer based solely on an insurance
26 score, or absence of an insurance score; and an insurer shall not cancel, nonrenew or increase the
27 rate of an existing customer based solely on a worsening in a customer’s insurance score unless: (i)
28 the worsening is due to a bankruptcy, tax lien, garnishment, foreclosure or judgment; or (ii) if a
29 subsequent insurance score no sooner than six (6) months later confirms the worsening in score.
30 Should an existing customer’s score change as the result of an updated credit report, the decrease
31 or increase in rates must be done at renewal subject to conditions established herein.
32 (4) No insurer is obligated to obtain a current credit report or insurance score for an insured
33 if: the insured is in the most favorably-priced tier of the insurer, within a group of affiliated insures
34 insurers; or credit was not used for the insured when the policy was initially written. However, the
LC002933/SUB A - Page 42 of 126

1 insurer shall have the discretion to use credit for the insured upon renewal, if consistent with its
2 underwriting guidelines. The user may not increase the rate of an existing customer based solely
3 on a worsening in the customer’s insurance score unless: (i) the worsening is due to a bankruptcy,
4 tax lien, garnishment, foreclosure or judgment; or (ii) if a subsequent insurance score no sooner
5 than six (6) months later confirms the worsening in score. Should an existing customer’s score
6 change as the result of an updated credit report, the decrease or increase in rates must be done at
7 renewal subject to conditions established herein.
8 (5) If a credit bureau determines that disputed information is inaccurate or incorrect and
9 that information was used in determining an insurance score which resulted in a denial, cancellation
10 or nonrenewal of or higher premiums or less favorable policy terms for a consumer, the insurer
11 shall, within thirty (30) days of receiving notice of correction, reissue or re-rate the policy by
12 refunding the amount of the overpayment of premium based on the corrected insurance score
13 retroactive to the shorter of the last twelve (12) months of coverage or the actual period of coverage.
14 An “insurance score” as used in this section shall be defined as a number or rating that is derived
15 from an algorithm, computer application, model or other process that is based in whole or in part
16 on credit history.
17 (b) Agents shall be held harmless by insurers for all acts, efforts and disclosures in
18 obtaining an insurance score on the insurer’s behalf. The commissioner is authorized and
19 empowered to establish rules and regulations to carry out the provisions of this section and to fulfill
20 the goals of this section.
21 (c) Notwithstanding the above, an insurer authorized to do business in Rhode Island that
22 uses credit information to underwrite or rate risks, shall not use the following as a negative factor
23 in any insurance scoring methodology or in reviewing credit information for the purpose of
24 underwriting or rating a policy of personal insurance:
25 (1) Credit inquiries not initiated by the consumer or inquiries requested by the consumer
26 for his or her own credit information;
27 (2) Inquiries relating to insurance coverage, if so identified on a consumer’s credit report;
28 (3) Collection accounts with a medical industry code, if so identified on the consumer’s
29 credit report;
30 (4) Multiple lender inquiries, if coded by the consumer reporting agency on the consumer’s
31 credit report as being from the home mortgage industry and made within thirty (30) days of one
32 another, unless only one inquiry is considered;
33 (5) Multiple lender inquiries, if coded by the consumer reporting agency on the consumer’s
34 credit report as being from the automobile lending industry and made within thirty (30) days of one
LC002933/SUB A - Page 43 of 126

1 another, unless only one inquiry is considered.
2 (d) No consumer reporting agency shall provide or sell data or lists that include any
3 information that in whole or in part was submitted in conjunction with an insurance inquiry about
4 a consumer’s credit information or a request for a credit report or insurance score. Such information
5 includes, but is not limited to, the expiration dates of an insurance policy or any other information
6 that may identify time periods during which a consumer’s insurance may expire and the terms and
7 conditions of the consumer’s insurance coverage.
8 (e) The restrictions provided in subsection (d) of this section do not apply to data or lists
9 the consumer reporting agency supplies to the insurance [agent/producer] from whom information
10 was received, the insurer on whose behalf such [agent/producer] acted, or such insurer’s affiliates
11 or holding companies.
12 (f) Nothing in this section shall be construed to restrict any insurer from being able to obtain
13 a claims history report or a motor vehicle report.

32 SECTION 13. Section 27-14.3-32 of the General Laws in Chapter 27-14.3 entitled
33 "Insurers’ Rehabilitation and Liquidation Act" is hereby amended to read as follows:
34 27-14.3-32. Voidable preferences and liens.
LC002933/SUB A - Page 47 of 126

1 (a)(1) A preference is a transfer of any of the property of an insurer to or for the benefit of
2 a creditor, for or on account of an antecedent debt, made or suffered by the insurer within one year
3 before the filing of a successful petition for liquidation under this chapter, the effect of which
4 transfer may be to enable the creditor to obtain a greater percentage of this debt than another
5 creditor of the same class would receive. If a liquidation order is entered while the insurer is already
6 subject to a rehabilitation order, then the transfers shall be deemed preferences if made or suffered
7 within one year before the filing of the successful petition for rehabilitation, or within two (2) years
8 before the filing of the successful petition for liquidation, whichever time is shorter.
9 (2) Any preference may be avoided by the liquidator if:
10 (i) The insurer was insolvent at the time of the transfer;
11 (ii) The transfer was made within four (4) months before the filing of the petition;
12 (iii) The creditor receiving it or to be benefited by it or his or her agent acting with reference
13 to it had, at the time when the transfer was made, reasonable cause to believe that the insurer was
14 insolvent or was about to become insolvent; or
15 (iv) The creditor receiving it was an officer, or any employee or attorney or other person
16 who was in fact in a position of comparable influence in the insurer to an officer whether or not he
17 or she held the petition position, or any shareholder holding directly or indirectly more than five
18 percent (5%) of any class of any equity security issued by the insurer, or any other person, firm,
19 corporation, association, or aggregation of persons with whom the insurer did not deal at arm’s
20 length.
21 (3) Where the preference is voidable, the liquidator may recover the property or, if it has
22 been converted, its value from any person who has received or converted the property; provided,
23 that where a bona fide purchaser or lienor has given less than fair equivalent value, he or she shall
24 have a lien upon the property to the extent of the consideration actually given by him or her. Where
25 a preference by way of lien or security title is voidable, the court may on due notice order the lien
26 or title preserved for the benefit of the estate, in the event the lien or title shall pass to the liquidator.
27 (4) Notwithstanding subsection (a)(2) of this section, or any other provision of this chapter,
28 no receiver or any other person shall avoid any preference arising under or in connection with any
29 pledge, security, credit, collateral, loan, advances, reimbursement or guarantee agreement or
30 arrangement or any similar agreement, arrangement, or other credit enhancement to which a federal
31 home loan bank, as defined in § 27-14.3-5, is a party.
32 (b)(1) A transfer of property other than real property shall be deemed made or suffered
33 when it becomes so far perfected that no subsequent lien obtainable by legal or equitable
34 proceedings on a simple contract could become superior to the rights of the transferee.
LC002933/SUB A - Page 48 of 126

1 (2) A transfer of real property shall be deemed made or suffered when it becomes so far
2 perfected that no subsequent bona fide purchaser from the insurer could obtain rights superior to
3 the rights of the transferee.
4 (3) A transfer which creates an equitable lien shall not be deemed perfected if there are
5 available means by which a legal lien could be created.
6 (4) A transfer not perfected prior to the filing of a petition for liquidation shall be deemed
7 made immediately before the filing of the successful petition.
8 (5) The provisions of this subsection apply whether or not there are or were creditors who
9 might have obtained liens or persons who might have become bona fide purchasers.
10 (c)(1) A lien obtainable by legal or equitable proceedings upon a simple contract is one
11 arising in the ordinary course of the proceedings upon the entry or docketing of a judgment or
12 decree, or upon attachment, garnishment, execution, or a similar process, whether before, upon, or
13 after judgment or decree and whether before or upon levy. It does not include liens that under
14 applicable law are given a special priority over other liens which are prior in time.
15 (2) A lien obtainable by legal or equitable proceedings could become superior to the rights
16 of a transferee or a purchaser could obtain rights superior to the rights of a transferee, within the
17 meaning of subsection (b) of this section, if the consequences would follow only from the lien or
18 purchase itself, or from the lien or purchase followed by any step wholly within the control of the
19 lienholder or purchaser, with or without the aid of ministerial action by public officials. That lien
20 could not become superior and that purchase could not create superior rights for the purpose of
21 subsection (b) of this section through any acts subsequent to the obtaining of the lien or subsequent
22 to the purchase which require the agreement or concurrence of any third party or which require any
23 further judicial action or ruling.
24 (d) A transfer of property for or on account of a new and contemporaneous consideration
25 which is deemed under subsection (b) of this section made or suffered after the transfer because of
26 delay in perfecting it does not by this become a transfer for or on account of an antecedent debt if
27 any acts required by the applicable law to be performed in order to perfect the transfer as against
28 liens or bona fide purchasers’ rights are performed within twenty-one (21) days or any period
29 expressly allowed by the law, whichever is less. A transfer to secure a future loan, if the loan is
30 actually made, or a transfer, which becomes security for a future loan, shall have the same effect
31 as a transfer for or on account of a new and contemporaneous consideration.
32 (e) If any lien deemed voidable under subdivision (a)(2) of this section has been dissolved
33 by the furnishing of a bond or other obligation, the surety on which has been indemnified directly
34 or indirectly by the transfer of or the creation of a lien upon any property of an insurer before the
LC002933/SUB A - Page 49 of 126

1 filing of a petition under this chapter which results in a liquidation order, the indemnifying transfer
2 or lien shall also be deemed voidable.
3 (f) The property affected by any lien deemed voidable under subsections (a) and (e) of this
4 section shall be discharged from the lien, and that property and any of the indemnifying property
5 transferred to or for the benefit of a surety shall pass to the liquidator, except that the court may on
6 due notice order any lien preserved for the benefit of the estate and the court may direct that
7 conveyance executed as may be proper or adequate to evidence the title of the liquidator.
8 (g) The superior court for the county of Providence shall have summary jurisdiction of any
9 proceeding by the liquidator to hear and determine the rights of any parties under this section.
10 Reasonable notice of any hearing in the proceeding shall be given to all parties in interest, including
11 the obligee of a releasing bond or other similar obligation. Where an order is entered for the
12 recovery of indemnifying property in kind or for the avoidance of an indemnifying lien the court,
13 upon application of any party in interest, shall in the same proceeding ascertain the value of the
14 property or lien, and if the value is less than the amount for which the property is indemnity or than
15 the amount of the lien, the transferee or lienholder may elect to retain the property or lien upon
16 payment of its value, as ascertained by the court, to the liquidator, within any reasonable times as
17 the court shall fix.
18 (h) The liability of the surety under a releasing bond or other similar obligation shall be
19 discharged to the extent of the value of the indemnifying property recovered or the indemnifying
20 lien nullified and avoided by the liquidator, or where the property is retained under subsection (g)
21 of this section to the extent of the amount paid to the liquidator.
22 (i) If a creditor has been preferred, and afterward in good faith gives the insurer further
23 credit without security of any kind for property which becomes a part of the insurer’s estate, the
24 amount of the new credit remaining unpaid at the time of the petition may be set off against the
25 preference which would be recoverable from him or her.
26 (j) If an insurer, directly or indirectly, within one year before the filing of a successful
27 petition for liquidation under this chapter, or at any time in contemplation of a proceeding to
28 liquidate it, pays money or transfers property to an attorney at law for services rendered or to be
29 rendered, the transactions may be examined by the court on its own motion or shall be examined
30 by the court on petition of the liquidator and shall be held valid only to the extent of a reasonable
31 amount to be determined by the court, and the excess may be recovered by the liquidator for the
32 benefits of the estate; provided, that where the attorney is in a position of influence in the insurer
33 or an affiliate of the insurer, payment of any money or the transfer of any property to the attorney
34 at law for services rendered or to be rendered shall be governed by the provision of subdivision
LC002933/SUB A - Page 50 of 126

1 (a)(2)(iv) of this section.
2 (k)(1) Every officer, manager, employee, shareholder, member, subscriber, attorney, or any
3 other person acting on behalf of the insurer who knowingly participates in giving any preference
4 when he or she has reasonable cause to believe the insurer is or is about to become insolvent at the
5 time of the preference shall be personally liable to the liquidator for the amount of the preference.
6 It is permissible to infer that there is a reasonable cause to believe this if the transfer was made
7 within four (4) months before the date of filing of this successful petition for liquidation.
8 (2) Every person receiving any property from the insurer or the benefit of the property as
9 a preference voidable under subsection (a) of this section shall be personally liable for it and shall
10 be bound to account to the liquidator.
11 (3) Nothing in this subsection shall prejudice any other claim by the liquidator against any
12 person.
13 SECTION 14. Section 27-18-25 of the General Laws in Chapter 27-18 entitled "Accident
14 and Sickness Insurance Policies" is hereby amended to read as follows:

19 provisions of chapters 29, 30, 35 35.1 and 37 of title 5, reimbursement under the insurance policy,
20 certificate, or service contract shall be based upon a determination of medical necessity and shall
21 not be denied because of race, color, or creed, nor shall any insurer make or permit any unfair
22 discrimination against particular individuals or persons licensed under chapters 29, 30, 35 35.1 and
23 37 of title 5.

9 section only if the issuing agency, organization, or association makes copies of the material
10 available to the public. An agency may not incorporate any material by reference unless the material

31 45-21.2-9. Retirement for accidental disability.
32 (a) Any member in active service, regardless of length of service, is entitled to an accidental
33 disability retirement allowance. Application for the allowance is made by the member or on the
34 member’s behalf, stating that the member is physically or mentally incapacitated for further service
LC002933/SUB A - Page 122 of 126

1 as the result of an injury or illness sustained while in the performance of duty and certifying to the
2 time, place, and conditions of the duty performed by the member that resulted in the alleged
3 disability and that the alleged disability was not the result of the willful negligence or misconduct
4 on the part of the member, and was not the result of age or length of service. The application shall
5 be made within eighteen (18) months of the alleged accident from which the injury has resulted in
6 the member’s present disability and shall be accompanied by an accident report and a physician’s
7 report certifying to the disability. If the member was able to return to his or her employment and
8 subsequently reinjures or aggravates the same injury or illness, the member shall make another
9 application within eighteen (18) months of the reinjury or aggravation that shall be accompanied
10 by a physician’s report certifying to the reinjury or aggravation causing the disability. If a medical
11 examination made by three (3) physicians engaged by the retirement board, and other investigations
12 as the board may make, confirms the statements made by the member, the board may grant the
13 member an accidental disability retirement allowance.
14 (b) For the purposes of subsection (a), “aggravation” shall mean an intervening work-
15 related trauma that independently contributes to a member’s original injury or illness that amounts
16 to more than the natural progression of the preexisting disease or condition and is not the result of
17 age or length of service. The intervening independent trauma causing the aggravation must be an
18 identifiable event or series of work-related events that are the proximate cause of the member’s
19 present condition of disability.
20 (c) “Occupational cancer,” as used in this section, means a cancer arising out of
21 employment as a firefighter, due to injury or illness due to exposures to smoke, fumes, or
22 carcinogenic, poisonous, toxic, or chemical substances while in the performance of active duty in
23 the fire department.
24 (d) For purposes of subsection (a), “reinjury” shall mean a recurrence of the original work-
25 related injury or illness from a specific ascertainable event. The specific event must be the
26 proximate cause of the member’s present condition of disability.
27 (e) Any firefighter, including one employed by the state, or a municipal firefighter
28 employed by a municipality that participates in the optional retirement for police officers and
29 firefighters as provided in this chapter, who is unable to perform his or her duties in the fire
30 department by reason of a disabling occupational cancer (as defined in §§ 45-19.1-2 and 45-19.1-
31 4) that develops or manifests itself during a period while the firefighter is in the service of the
32 department, and any retired member of the fire force of any city or town who develops occupational
33 cancer (as defined in §§ 45-19.1-2 and 45-19.1-4), is entitled to receive an occupational cancer
34 disability and he or she is entitled to all of the benefits provided for in this chapter, chapters 19,
LC002933/SUB A - Page 123 of 126

1 19.1, and 21 of this title, and chapter 10 of title 36 if the firefighter is employed by the state.
2 (f) Any police officer or firefighter as defined in §§ 45-19-1(b) and (c) who is unable to
3 perform their duties by reason of post-traumatic stress injury/PTSD as set forth in § 45-19-1(a)(2)
4 is entitled to receive an accidental disability retirement allowance and the police officer or
5 firefighter is entitled to all of the benefits provided for in this chapter (including the presumption
6 set forth in subsection (a)(2) of this section § 45-19-1(a)(2)), chapters 19, 19.1, and 21 of this title,
7 and chapter 10 of title 36 if the firefighter is employed by the state.
8 (g) In the event that any party is aggrieved by the determination of the retirement board
9 pursuant to § 45-19-1, for an injury or illness occurring on or after July 1, 2011, the party may
10 submit an appeal to the Rhode Island workers’ compensation court. The appellant shall file a notice
11 of appeal with the retirement board and with the workers’ compensation court within twenty (20)
12 days of the entry of the retirement board’s decision and shall serve a copy of the notice of appeal
13 upon the opposing party.
14 (h) Within twenty (20) days of the receipt of the notice of appeal, the retirement board shall
15 transmit the entire record of proceedings before it, together with its order, to the workers’
16 compensation court.
17 (i) In the event that a party files a notice of appeal to the workers’ compensation court, the
18 order of the retirement board shall be stayed pending further action by the court pursuant to the
19 provisions of § 28-35-20.
20 (j) Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the court shall assign the matter to a judge and
21 shall issue a notice at the time advising the parties of the judge to whom the case has been assigned
22 and the date for pretrial conference in accordance with § 28-35-20.
23 (k) All proceedings filed with the workers’ compensation court pursuant to this section
24 shall be de novo and shall be subject to the provisions of chapters 29 — 38 of title 28 for all case
25 management procedures and dispute resolution processes, as provided under the rules of the
26 workers’ compensation court. The workers’ compensation court shall enter a pretrial order in
27 accordance with § 28-35-20(c) that grants or denies, in whole or in part, the relief sought by the
28 petitioner. The pretrial order shall be effective upon entry and any payments ordered by it shall be
29 paid within fourteen (14) days of the entry of the order. Provided, however, that in the event that
30 the retirement board files a claim for trial of the pretrial order entered by the court, the order of the
31 court shall be stayed until a final order or decree is entered by the court. If after trial and the entry
32 of a final decree the court sustains the findings and orders entered in the pretrial order, the
33 retirement board shall reimburse the municipality all benefits paid by it from the time the pretrial
34 order was entered until the time the final decree is entered by the court. Where the matter has been
LC002933/SUB A - Page 124 of 126

1 heard and decided by the workers’ compensation court, the court shall retain jurisdiction to review
2 any prior orders or decrees entered by it. The petitions to review shall be filed directly with the
3 workers’ compensation court and shall be subject to the case management and dispute resolution
4 procedures set forth in chapters 29 — 38 of title 28 (“Labor and Labor Relations”).
5 (l) If the court determines that a member qualifies for accidental disability retirement, the
6 member shall receive a retirement allowance equal to sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66⅔%) of
7 the rate of the member’s compensation at the date of the member’s retirement, subject to the
8 provisions of § 45-21-31.
9 (m) If the court determines that a member does not qualify for accidental disability
10 retirement, and after all appeals have been exhausted by the member (i.e., appeals to the workers’
11 compensation appellate division and the Rhode Island supreme court), said member shall have
12 twenty (20) days within which to either:
13 (1) File an application for ordinary disability retirement pursuant to § 45-21.2-7; however,
14 if the member does not have the requisite time on the job to file such application, then the
15 participating municipality shall continue to consider the member injured on duty pursuant to § 45-
16 19-1 until such time that the member has the necessary time on the job to file the application for an
17 ordinary disability retirement; or
18 (2) File an application for a service retirement pursuant to § 45-21.2-5; or
19 (3) Return to duty provided the member has received medical clearance to perform those
20 duties.
21 Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit the member from making an agreement with the
22 member’s participating municipality as to what options and benefits the member may be entitled
23 to in lieu of the options and benefits set forth in this subsection. In addition, nothing in this
24 subsection shall prohibit the member’s bargaining unit and participating municipality from entering
25 into a collective bargaining agreement that addresses the issues in this subsection.
