14 (2) “Private entity data” means any data purchased from private entities or involving wage,
15 address, or other eligibility-related data collected by a private entity, such as data reported by
16 employers to a private entity.
17 (3) "Public assistance reporting information system" or "PARIS" means a federal-state
18 partnership that facilitates the sharing of data between states to identify individuals who may be
1 receiving benefits in multiple states.
2 (4) “Public data sources” means any data collected, maintained, or controlled by a state or
3 federal government entity or agency, including, but not limited to, SWICA, PARIS, and other state-
4 administered databases.

9 (7) “Termination” shall mean a removal from Medicaid enrollment as a result of a decision

11 (8) “Termination decision” shall mean a decision of whether or not to terminate, including
12 decisions to not terminate. It shall include a decision to request information from an individual
13 when the failure to respond within a set timeframe will remove the individual from enrollment in

15 request from enrollment in Medicaid shall not count as an additional termination decision, but a
16 decision of whether or not to proceed with removing the individual from enrollment in Medicaid
17 after they do respond in any manner shall count as an additional termination decision, even if the
18 response is deemed insufficient.
19 40-23-3. Eligibility determination based on state data only.
20 (a) Eligibility criteria. The eligibility for Medicaid benefits in Rhode Island shall be
21 determined exclusively by the use of the following state-controlled data sources:

23 information.
24 (2) PARIS data, including information about applicants who may be receiving benefits
25 from other states.
26 (3) Other state-maintained databases as determined by the Rhode Island executive office
27 of health and human services.
28 (b) Prohibition on private entity data. No private entity data may be used for any part of
29 the Medicaid eligibility determination process, including post-eligibility verification. Any
30 termination where private entity data was utilized for any part of the decision to terminate shall not
31 be valid.
32 (c) Retroactive reinstatement. Any individuals terminated from Medicaid utilizing private
33 entity data prior to the effective date of this act shall be retroactively reinstated within ten (10) days
34 of the effective date of this act, unless the executive office of health and human services determines
LC000288 - Page 2 of 4
1 that the decision to terminate was correct using only state data sources within the ten (10) days. If
2 the decision to terminate is determined to be correct, terminated individuals shall have a right to
3 appeal the termination to the executive office of health and human services and/or the superior
4 court and shall receive written notice of their rights. The executive office of health and human
5 services shall not impose a time limit on the right of appeal.

7 the decision to terminate was made by a human being employed by the executive office of health
8 and human services or the department of human services. No terminations from Medicaid shall be
9 valid if, on the day when the decision to terminate was made, the employee making the decision to
10 terminate made more than fifty (50) termination decisions. No termination from Medicaid shall be
11 valid if the decision to terminate was made by a computer program. If the decision to terminate was
12 recommended by a computer program, the burden of proof shall fall on the state to demonstrate
13 that the employee certifying the termination made a good faith effort to independently review the
14 case.
15 SECTION 2. This act shall take effect upon passage.
