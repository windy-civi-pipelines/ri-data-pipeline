14 (4) “Sale at Retail” means sale of a consumer commodity to the ultimate customer.
15 (5) “Total price” of a consumer commodity means the full purchase price of a consumer
16 commodity without regard to units of weight, measure, or count.
17 (6) “Ultimate customer” is a person who purchases a product other than for resale.
18 (7) “Unit price” of a consumer commodity means the retail price of a consumer commodity

1 expressed in terms of the retail price of the commodity per the unit of weight, measure, or count,
2 as the director designates, computed to the nearest whole cent or fraction thereof as the director
3 designates.
4 (8) “Electronic shelving label” means any remote-controlled digital display used to indicate
5 the retail, unit, and/or total price to the ultimate consumer.
6 6-31-3. Means of disclosure.
7 (a) Persons subject to the requirements of § 6-31-2 shall disclose the unit price and total
8 price to consumers in one or more of the following appropriate ways:
9 (1) If the consumer commodity is so located that it is not conspicuously visible to the

13 (2) By attachment of a stamp, tag, or label directly adjacent to the consumer commodity,
14 on the shelf on which the commodity is displayed, or by stamping or affixing the price information
15 on the commodity itself; provided, however, that upon each commodity shall be stamped or affixed
16 the total price of the commodity in arabic numerals if and when a computerized system is used; and
17 provided, further, that an electronic shelving label alone shall not satisfy the provisions of this

20 (b) If any portion of this section is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
21 unlawful, such finding shall not affect any other portion of this section not specifically so found.
