3 27-18-38. Diabetes treatment.
4 (a) Every individual or group health insurance contract, plan, or policy delivered, issued
5 for delivery or renewed in this state which provides medical coverage that includes coverage for
6 physician services in a physician’s office, and every policy which provides major medical or similar
7 comprehensive-type coverage, except for supplemental policies which only provide coverage for

11 monitors and blood glucose monitors for the legally blind, test strips for glucose monitors and/or
12 visual reading, insulin, injection aids, cartridges for the legally blind, syringes, insulin pumps and
13 appurtenances to the pumps, insulin infusion devices, and oral agents for controlling blood sugar
14 and therapeutic/molded shoes for the prevention of amputation.
15 (b) Upon the approval of new or improved diabetes equipment and supplies by the Food
16 and Drug Administration, all policies governed by this section shall guarantee coverage of new
17 diabetes equipment and supplies when medically appropriate and prescribed by a physician. These
18 policies shall also include coverage, when medically necessary, for diabetes self-management
19 education to ensure that persons with diabetes are instructed in the self-management and treatment

1 of their diabetes, including information on the nutritional management of diabetes. The coverage
2 for self-management education and education relating to medical nutrition therapy shall be limited
3 to medically necessary visits upon the diagnosis of diabetes, where a physician diagnoses a
4 significant change in the patient’s symptoms or conditions which necessitate changes in a patient’s
5 self-management, or where reeducation or refresher training is necessary. This education when
6 medically necessary and prescribed by a physician, may be provided only by the physician or, upon
7 his or her referral to an appropriately licensed and certified health care provider and may be
8 conducted in group settings. Coverage for self-management education and education relating to
9 medical nutrition therapy shall also include home visits when medically necessary.
10 (c) Benefit plans offered by an insurer may impose co-payment and/or deductibles for the
11 benefits mandated by this chapter; however, in no instance shall the co-payment or deductible
12 amount be greater than the co-payment or deductible amount imposed for other supplies, equipment
13 or physician office visits. Benefits for services under this section shall be reimbursed in accordance
14 with the respective principles and mechanisms of reimbursement for each insurer, hospital, or
15 medical service corporation, or health maintenance organization.

19 supply lasting thirty (30) days, or per item when an item is intended to be used for longer than thirty
20 (30) days. Coverage for such equipment and supplies shall not be subject to any annual deductible.

22 met their plan's deductible would result in health savings account ineligibility under 26 U.S.C. §
23 223, then the cap would only apply to that specific item of equipment or supply after the covered
24 person has met their plan's deductible.
