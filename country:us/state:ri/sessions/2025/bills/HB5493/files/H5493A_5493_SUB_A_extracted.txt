Referred To: House Environment and Natural Resources
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1 Title 23 of the General Laws entitled "HEALTH AND SAFETY" is hereby
2 amended by adding thereto the following chapter:
3 CHAPTER 27.5
4 BUILDING DECARBONIZATION ACT OF 2025
5 23-27.5-1. Definitions.
6 As used in this chapter:
7 (1) “Benchmarking information” means information generated by the benchmarking tool
8 as herein defined, including information about the physical property and its operational
9 characteristics. The information shall include, but need not be limited to:
10 (i) Property address;
11 (ii) Primary use type;
12 (iii) Gross floor area;
13 (iv) Annual energy use;
14 (v) Source energy use intensity (EUI); site EUI, weather normalized source EUI, and
15 weather normalized site EUI;
16 (vi) Annual greenhouse gas emissions; and
17 (vii) Compliance or noncompliance with this statute.
18 (2) “Benchmarking tool” means ENERGY STAR portfolio manager, the internet-based
19 tool developed and maintained by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) to track
1 and assess the relative energy performance of buildings nationwide. Should ENERGY STAR
2 Portfolio Manager become unavailable for any reporting year(s), the reporting obligations herein
3 shall be suspended until such time it is again available or a comparable alternative is designated by
4 the office of energy resources ("OER").
5 (3) “Campus” means two (2) or more buildings that are served by shared utility services
6 and predominantly used for health care, research or higher education purposes.
7 (4) “Covered property” means all residential and non-residential buildings and campuses
8 containing twenty-five thousand (25,000) or more gross square feet defined herein and identified
9 by the relevant municipal tax assessor's database.
10 (5) “Dwelling unit” means a single residential unit consisting of one or more rooms,
11 occupied or arranged to be occupied as a residential unit separate from all other residential units
12 within a building, and used primarily for residential purposes and not primarily for professional or
13 commercial purposes.
14 (6) “Energy” means electricity, natural gas, steam, hot or chilled water, heating oil, or other
15 product for use in a building, or renewable electricity generation, for purposes of providing heating,
16 cooling, lighting, water heating, or for powering or fueling other end-uses in the building and
17 related facilities.
18 (7) “ENERGY STAR” means the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency program related
19 to improving energy efficiency in buildings and products.
20 (8) “Gross square feet” means the gross floor area of the property as defined by the U.S.
21 EPA portfolio manager.
22 (9) “Owner” means:
23 (i) An individual or entity designated in the records of the local municipal tax assessor as
24 the owner of a covered property;
25 (ii) An agent authorized by law to act on behalf of the owner of a covered property;
26 (iii) In the case of a condominium, the person or persons authorized by law to act on behalf
27 of the condominium association or its board of directors, managers or trustees; and/or
28 (iv) In the case of a cooperative, the person or persons authorized by law to act on behalf
29 of the cooperative.
30 (10) “Site energy” means the annual amount of all the energy each property consumes
31 onsite, regardless of the source. It not only includes energy purchased from a utility or in bulk, but
32 also renewable energy generated and consumed onsite such as from solar or wind (excess
33 renewable energy generated onsite is excluded from site energy use). Site energy can be used to
34 understand how the energy use for an individual property has changed over time.
LC001267/SUB A - Page 2 of 6
1 (11) “Source energy” means the total amount of raw fuel that is required to operate the
2 property. Source EUI ("energy use intensity") is source energy divided by the property's gross floor
3 area. In addition to what the property consumes onsite, source energy includes losses that take place
4 during generation, transmission, and distribution of the energy, thereby enabling a complete
5 assessment of energy consumption resulting from building operations. Source energy shall be used
6 to understand the complete energy impact of each property and compare the energy performance
7 across covered properties in the program.
8 (12) "Tenant" means a person or entity leasing, occupying or holding over possession of a
9 covered property or municipal property.
10 (13) "Utility" means an entity that distributes, supplies, or transmits energy to covered
11 properties.
12 23-27.5-2. Establishment.
13 There is hereby established a building energy reporting program for covered properties.
14 The office of energy resources ("OER") shall be responsible for reporting this information to the
15 public in order to provide transparency to the marketplace.
16 23-27.5-3. Benchmarking required for covered properties.
17 (a) Owners of covered properties shall input annual energy use from January 1 through

23 hundred ninety-nine (49,999) gross square feet, no later than May 15, 2029, and by every May 15
24 thereafter;
25 (3) Following the receipt of a certificate of occupancy, a new covered property that has not
26 yet accumulated twelve (12) months of energy use data by the first applicable reporting deadline
27 shall comply with building energy benchmarking reporting requirements herein beginning May 15
28 following the first full calendar year of building occupancy.
29 23-27.5-4. Notification of covered properties.

12 benchmarked;
13 (2) A demolition permit for the entire property was issued and demolition work
14 commenced during the calendar year; or

1 report building-specific energy data on their behalf to the OER. Such authorization shall not remove
2 the obligation of property owners to comply with reporting requirements.
3 23-27.5-8. Municipal implementation of building energy benchmarking
4 requirements.
