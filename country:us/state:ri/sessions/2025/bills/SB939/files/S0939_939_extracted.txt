FOR PACKAGING AND PAPER ACT
Introduced By: Senator Jacob Bissaillon
Date Introduced: April 04, 2025
Referred To: Senate Environment & Agriculture
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Title 23 of the General Laws entitled "HEALTH AND SAFETY" is hereby
2 amended by adding thereto the following chapter:
3 CHAPTER 19.19
4 EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY FOR PACKAGING AND PAPER ACT
5 23-19.19-1. Legislative intent.
6 (a) This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Extended Producer Responsibility
7 For Packaging and Paper Act."
8 (b) The legislature finds that valuable resources are wasted when products are disposed
9 instead of recycled or reused and that state and local policy have created a municipal recycling
10 system that lacks coordination, adequate funding, and accountability. Product producers have a
11 responsibility to correct these shortcomings by funding municipal recycling programs; improving
12 those programs; and coordinating their planning, performance, and effectiveness. Producer
13 responsibility is in the public interest of the state and furthers environmental objectives, including
14 the establishment of a circular economy, preserving resources, and reducing carbon and other
15 emissions associated with primary production.

26 services for covered materials. As this information is critical to developing a plan, service providers
27 shall respond to data requests from the third-party organization contracted for this work or be
28 subject to enforcement action under § 23-19.19-13. The third party, organization, department, and

7 to:
8 (1) The material throughput at processing facilities providing recycling services to covered
9 entities and the facilities' capacity for processing material;

11 sorters);
12 (3) Composition of tons received and composition of tons processed and sold;
13 (4) Tip fees charged for processing; and
14 (5) Data on contamination.
15 (e) Additional data. The scope of the baseline assessment may include:
16 (1) The market conditions and opportunities for the use of recycled covered materials in
17 the state and region and issues with access to markets for recycled covered materials;

11 through a combination of an alternative collection program and the commingled systems described
12 in this section.
13 (c) The producer responsibility organization shall draw on the findings of the baseline
14 assessment and consult with the advisory board, producers submitting individual program plans,

4 (a) There is hereby created in the office of the general treasurer the extended producer
5 responsibility for packaging and paper administrative fund, referred to in this section as the "fund."

32 23-19.19-18. No obligation to provide covered services.
33 Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a private service provider is not required to

RELATING TO HEALTH AND SAFETY -- EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY
FOR PACKAGING AND PAPER ACT
Introduced By: Senator Jacob Bissaillon
Date Introduced: April 04, 2025
Referred To: Senate Environment & Agriculture
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Title 23 of the General Laws entitled "HEALTH AND SAFETY" is hereby
2 amended by adding thereto the following chapter:

6 (a) This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Extended Producer Responsibility
7 For Packaging and Paper Act."
8 (b) The legislature finds that valuable resources are wasted when products are disposed
9 instead of recycled or reused and that state and local policy have created a municipal recycling
10 system that lacks coordination, adequate funding, and accountability. Product producers have a
11 responsibility to correct these shortcomings by funding municipal recycling programs; improving
12 those programs; and coordinating their planning, performance, and effectiveness. Producer
13 responsibility is in the public interest of the state and furthers environmental objectives, including
14 the establishment of a circular economy, preserving resources, and reducing carbon and other
15 emissions associated with primary production.

22 convenience for covered entities, at a minimum, wherever collection services for mixed municipal
23 solid waste are available.

10 systems described in this section to meet performance targets for any material type that is managed
11 through a combination of an alternative collection program and the commingled systems described
12 in this section.
13 (c) The producer responsibility organization shall draw on the findings of the baseline
14 assessment and consult with the advisory board, producers submitting individual program plans,
15 service providers, and other interested parties to develop or amend the recyclable or compostable
16 covered materials lists and shall review any requests by interested parties for addition or removal
17 of covered materials from the lists created under this section.

32 23-19.19-18. No obligation to provide covered services.
33 Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a private service provider is not required to
