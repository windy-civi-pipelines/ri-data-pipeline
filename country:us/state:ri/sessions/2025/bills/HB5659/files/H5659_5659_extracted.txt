11 reader.
12 (c) A state law enforcement agency shall adopt, via rulemaking procedures pursuant to
13 chapter 35 of title 42, its policies and procedures relating to the operation of an automated license
14 plate reader system prior to engaging in any of the following acts:

3 about such passersby or pedestrians through the usage of facial, voice, iris, or other software;
4 (4) In the absence of a judicial warrant, utilizing any photographs, records or images
5 produced through the implementation of the automated license plate reader for the purpose of
6 identifying potentially associated vehicles;

18 shall immediately confirm visually that the license plate on the vehicle matches the image of the
19 license plate displayed on the automated license plate reader and that the license plate number

5 data identified a stolen vehicle or license plate, a warrant for the arrest of the owner of the vehicle,
6 or any other basis for pursuing the owner or operator of a motor vehicle based on an identification
7 generated in accordance with § 12-5.3-3(a);
8 (3) The census tract in which any stationary or fixed location automated license plate reader

23 unless and until such time as approval is obtained in accordance with this chapter.
24 12-5.3-6. Remedies and penalties.
