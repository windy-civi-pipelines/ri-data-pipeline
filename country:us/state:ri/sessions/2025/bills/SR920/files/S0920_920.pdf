PROCLAIMING APRIL OF 2025, TO BE "PARKINSON'S AWARENESS MONTH" IN THE
STATE OF RHODE ISLAND
Introduced By: Senator Jessica de la Cruz
Date Introduced: March 28, 2025
Referred To: Placed on the Senate Consent Calendar
1 WHEREAS, Parkinson’s Disease is a chronic, progressive neurological disease and is the
2 second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States, second only to Alzheimer’s
3 disease; and
4 WHEREAS, According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Parkinson’s is
5 the 14th leading cause of death in the United States; and
6 WHEREAS, Approximately one million people in the United States are currently living
7 with Parkinson's Disease. Every six minutes, there is a new Parkinson's Disease diagnosis, and
8 each year there are nearly 90,000 new diagnoses of Parkinson's Disease which represents a 50
9 percent increase from previous years. In Rhode Island, one to two thousand people suffer from
10 Parkinson's Disease; and
11 WHEREAS, Approximately five to ten percent of Parkinson's Disease diagnoses occur
12 before the age of 50, with the onset of Parkinson's Disease commonly occurring at the age of 60
13 and older; and
14 WHEREAS, Although research suggests Parkinson’s results from a combination of
15 genetic and environmental factors, the exact cause and progression of the disease is still unknown
16 and there is no objective test or biomarker with which to diagnose the disease; and
17 WHEREAS, Symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease vary from person to person and can
18 include tremors, slowness, difficulty with balance, swallowing, chewing, speaking, rigidity,
19 constipation, skin problems, cognitive problems, dementia, and mood disorders such as

1 depression and anxiety; and
2 WHEREAS, Currently there is no known cure or drug to slow or halt the progression of
3 Parkinson’s Disease, and available treatments are limited in their ability to address the medical
4 needs of patients; and
5 WHEREAS, Increased efforts and awareness are desperately needed to help expedite
6 research efforts for better treatments, and ultimately a cure, as well as creating enhanced
7 programs and services to help those impacted by Parkinson’s Disease to improve their quality of
8 life until a cure is found; now, therefore be it
9 RESOLVED, That this Senate of the State of Rhode Island hereby proclaims April of
10 2025, to be "Parkinson’s Awareness Month" in the State of Rhode Island; and be it further
11 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
12 transmit a duly certified copy of this resolution to the American Parkinson Disease Association,
13 Rhode Island Chapter.
