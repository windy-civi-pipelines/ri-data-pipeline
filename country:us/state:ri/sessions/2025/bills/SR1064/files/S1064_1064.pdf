Date Introduced: May 09, 2025
Referred To: Placed on the Senate Consent Calendar
1 WHEREAS, Once again, Brown University is continuing its trailblazing path when it
2 comes to women’s athletics. The Brown Bears once again added to their stellar tradition of
3 excellence in women’s athletics that has included having the first woman to play Division I
4 Baseball and the first female football division coach, by becoming the first college program to
5 win three consecutive Collegiate Rugby National 7’s Championships in a row; and
6 WHEREAS, The current dominant streak began for the Brown Women’s Rugby Team in
7 2023 when they shut out Navy to win their first national title, which was followed up in 2024,
8 when they defeated Army 12-5 to repeat as champions; and
9 WHEREAS, Most recently, Brown began its march for a three-peat when they trounced
10 Adrian College in the first round. Brown continued its superb play in the round of when they
11 easily defeated Navy by the score of 24-7, to set up a final-four match-up with Penn State. After a
12 hard-fought first half that ended in a tied score of 7-7, the Brown Bears kicked things into high
13 gear and put on a sterling performance in the second half to defeat Penn State 19-7 and to
14 advance to the national championship game; and
15 WHEREAS, In the Championship Final, the Brown Bears once again faced Army for the
16 title after falling behind early, roared back to sweep away the Black Knights to secure a 19-7
17 victory and their third national title in row. The most recent championship gives the Bears head
18 coach, the winningest coach in women’s college rugby history, her fifth national title, with the
19 first two coming at Life University. The Bears benefitted in their title run by the outstanding play

1 provided by All-tournament Team Members Akilah Cathey, the Tournament MVP, and Nikki
2 Lynch; and
3 WHEREAS, Winning a national title in any team sport is an incredible achievement that
4 would not be possible unless every member of the team gave their all and placed team needs
5 ahead of individual aspirations. The Brown University Women’s Rugby Team has those qualities
6 in abundance as they were led all season by the outstanding play and important contributions
