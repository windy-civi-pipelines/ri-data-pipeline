2 amended by adding thereto the following sections:
3 20-4-15. Commercial dock space set aside for use by commercial seafood industry.

15 funding of the LASA (RI Local Agriculture and Seafood Act) program and/or the commercial dock
16 space preservation fund to ensure that applications for renovations to, and applications for new,
17 commercial dock space are reviewed for inclusion of a set aside or a preference for dock space for
18 commercial fishers in order to assure the long-term economic prosperity of Rhode Island’s seafood
19 industry.
1 (d) The DEM shall determine the need for dock space for commercial fishers in the area of
2 the commercial dock space, including the historical need of commercial fishers for space in the
3 area being developed or renovated and shall make a determination of whether space should be set
4 aside or given a preference for use by the commercial fishing industry.
5 (e) The CRMC shall implement the DEM determinations for any Rhode Island commercial
6 dock space within CRMC jurisdiction.
7 (f) The DEM shall promulgate rules and regulations necessary for the administration of
8 this section which shall include commercial fishing activity requirements in order to obtain use of
9 the commercial dock space set aside for the seafood industry pursuant to this section.
