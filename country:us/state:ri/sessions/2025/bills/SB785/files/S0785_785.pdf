RELATING TO EDUCATION -- BILINGUAL, DUAL LANGUAGE AND WORLD
LANGUAGE TEACHERS INVESTMENT ACT
Introduced By: Senators Vargas, Lawson, Mack, DiPalma, Zurier, McKenney, and
Acosta
Date Introduced: March 14, 2025
Referred To: Senate Finance
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Findings of fact.
2 (1) The demographic divide in which there are less bilingual, dual language and world
3 language teachers and more multilingual students is of growing public concern.
4 (2) Currently, multilingual students comprise twenty-seven percent (27%) of students in
5 Rhode Island’s urban core student population and sixteen percent (16%) of Rhode Island’s
6 statewide student population (Rhode Island Kids Count, 2024).
7 (3) Only two percent (2%) of multilingual learners are enrolled in dual language programs
8 and comprise a large portion of urban core and urban ring school students.
9 (5) A common explanation of why the demographic divide is so concerning is that
10 multilingual students benefit most from instruction from teachers that are certified in bilingual, dual
11 language and world language.
12 (6) More students benefiting from dual language instruction may, in turn, translate into
13 better academic outcomes such as student motivation, improved interest in academics, consistent
14 attendance, and grades.
15 (7) Bilingual, dual language and world language teachers represent excellent role models
16 and provide a continuous source of inspiration for not only multilingual students, but all students.
17 (8) Linguistic separation and isolation can be countered through significant investment in
18 bilingual, dual language and world language teachers that will deliver academic content through

1 multiple languages.
2 (9) Students learn important societal lessons through the example of cooperative interracial
3 and interethnic relationships among teachers.
4 (10) It is in the best interest of the state, its residents, and its students to develop and support
5 certified bilingual, dual language and world language teachers. The Rhode Island Blueprint for a
6 Multilingual Learner Success (2021) calls for a nimble system that "Secures and allocates human
7 and fiscal resources to support high-quality core instruction to meet the diverse needs of MLLs,
8 including professional learning opportunities for all teachers and administrators."
9 (11) Support for increased preparation and training of bilingual, dual language and world
10 language teachers can successfully be leveraged by providing direct financial support to public
11 institutions of higher education in Rhode Island working to increase the number of certified
12 bilingual, dual language and world language teachers.
