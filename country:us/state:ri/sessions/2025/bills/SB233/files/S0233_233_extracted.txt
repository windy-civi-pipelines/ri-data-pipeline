4 the curricula shall be made available to the public, subject to copyright considerations.
5 (3) The commissioner shall direct all local education agencies (“LEAs”) to select one of
6 the identified high-quality curricula and materials by the time of their next adoption cycle, but in
7 any case, no later than June 30, 2023, for mathematics and English language arts, and no later than
8 June 30, 2025, for science and technology. LEAs shall select curriculum and materials that are
9 responsive to the LEA’s cultural and linguistic needs, and support culturally responsive practices.
10 LEAs shall implement the high-quality curricula and materials at the start of the school year that
11 immediately follows the selection. If an LEA is unable to implement the high-quality curricula and
12 materials fully due to financial hardship, the commissioner may grant the LEA an extension of
13 time, provided that the LEA demonstrates continued efforts to complete the implementation.
14 (4) The commissioner shall institute a waiver process for LEAs that would like to use a
15 curriculum other than any identified by the commissioner pursuant to this section. Part of that
16 process may include, but is not limited to, asking the LEA to:
17 (i) Develop local curriculum goals;
18 (ii) Communicate the rationale for selecting the proposed curriculum over any of the
19 curricula identified by the commissioner; and
20 (iii) Engage a third-party reviewer that has a proven track record of curriculum audits to
21 review the proposed curriculum to ensure it aligns with state standards, establishes the scope and
22 sequence of instruction, is of high quality, is culturally relevant, and to discuss any other strengths
23 and weaknesses.
24 (5) Waiver determinations made pursuant to subsection (a)(4) of this section shall be
25 appealable to the board of education.
26 (6) Any LEA that has at least seventy-five percent (75%) of its students meeting
27 expectations on state assessments and also has no student subgroup identified for targeted
28 assistance under Rhode Island’s accountability process may select and use curricula and materials
29 other than any identified by the commissioner pursuant to this section for that subject area, only;
30 provided, however, that if the LEA no longer has at least seventy-five percent (75%) of its students
31 meeting expectations on state assessments, or if any student subgroup is identified for targeted
32 assistance under Rhode Island’s accountability process, the LEA must select and implement one of
33 the curricula identified by the commissioner pursuant to this section.
34 (7) LEAs shall develop and execute a curriculum implementation plan that includes
LC000380 - Page 5 of 8

1 professional development to ensure that all teachers and administrators are prepared to implement
2 the new curriculum with the necessary skill and knowledge.
3 (8) The council shall develop procedures for updating the identification of curricula and
4 materials pursuant to this section by no later than September 1, 2021. The procedures shall include
5 a requirement that the council review and evaluate the identified curricula and materials regularly
6 to ensure that the high quality of the curricula and materials is maintained. The review cycle shall
7 begin in 2025, with subsequent reviews taking place in 2029, 2033, and every four (4) years
8 thereafter.
9 (b) On or before December 1, 2020, and annually thereafter on or before December 1, the
10 commissioner shall report to the governor, president of the senate, and the speaker of the house,
11 regarding the progress toward fulfilling the requirements of this section, including, but not limited
12 to, the high-quality curricula and materials identified, selected, and implemented by LEAs pursuant
13 to this section.
14 (c) The state shall establish a professional development fund to provide professional
15 learning to LEAs that elect to use prioritized curricula and materials in mathematics and English
16 language arts as identified by the commissioner.
17 (d) For the purposes of this section, “local education agencies” (“LEAs”) shall include all
18 of the following within the state of Rhode Island:
19 (1) Public school districts;
20 (2) Regional school districts;
21 (3) State-operated schools;

25 (a) Once local education agencies (“LEAs”) select high-quality curriculum and materials
26 pursuant to § 16-22-32, the department of elementary and secondary education (the “department”)
27 shall identify an LEA assistance partner from within the department to provide any and all support
28 requested by the LEA or individual schools within the LEA regarding access to, implementation
29 of, and professional development for the curriculum and materials.
30 (b) The LEA assistance partner shall meet with teachers, principals, administrators, or other
31 school officials of the LEA to which they are assigned at a school within the LEA on a regular
32 basis, which shall be no less frequently than every three (3) months, to discuss the progress toward

3 population being served;

6 using the same curriculum and materials.
7 (c) The LEA assistance partner shall tour all schools within its assigned LEA with at least
8 one teacher and the principal or assistant principal:
9 (1) To observe challenges teachers are facing while implementing the curriculum and
10 materials;
11 (2) To discuss with the teacher and principal or assistant principal ideas to help resolve
12 those challenges; and
13 (3) To answer any questions regarding the curriculum or implementation thereof.
14 (d) The LEA assistance partner shall have follow-up meetings at schools within their
15 assigned LEA as often as requested by an individual school or the entire LEA to ensure all educators
16 are comfortable implementing the curriculum effectively.
17 (e) The LEA assistance partner shall report to the department no less frequently than every
18 three (3) months regarding the status of curriculum implementation at the schools within their
19 assigned LEA.
