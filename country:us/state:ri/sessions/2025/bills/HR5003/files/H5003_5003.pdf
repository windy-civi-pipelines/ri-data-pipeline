1 WHEREAS, It is with deep sadness that this House has learned of the passing of Timothy
2 R. "Tim" Phillips, beloved son of the Honorable Robert Phillips of Woonsocket, an esteemed
3 member of the Rhode Island House of Representatives, and his wife, Nancy Phillips; and
4 WHEREAS, Timothy was born on November 26, 1982, in Ware, Massachusetts, along
5 with his twin brother Matthew, with whom he shared a special lifelong bond that only twins can
6 understand and know; and
7 WHEREAS, Tim was raised in East Woonsocket where he attended Woonsocket's local
8 schools and lived the past twenty-five years in Bellingham, Massachusetts. Timothy was a very
9 active youngster who was very involved with the Cub Scouts Pack 6 and later the Boy Scouts
10 Troop 6. A graduate of the New England Institute of Technology, where he specialized in
11 automotive service and repair, had a thriving career working at the Sears Tire Center at Warwick
12 Mall, Acura of Boston and Boch Honda on the Automile in Norwood. Most recently, he had been
13 a valued employee at Town Faire Tire in Milford, Massachusetts, where he was widely admired
14 for his tireless work and diligence in performing his responsibilities; and
15 WHEREAS, Tim loved everything related to cars during his entire life. He enjoyed four-
16 wheel driving, following NASCAR, and enjoyed working on and fixing the cars of his family
17 members and many friends. In addition to cars, Tim enjoyed listening to all types of music, from
18 the oldies to hard rock, and had a passion for fishing, both saltwater and freshwater. Wherever
19 there was a body of water, Tim was ready to cast a line to catch some fish; and
20 WHEREAS, Most important in Tim's life was always his son, Devin, born in 2003.

1 Timothy was a devoted father who always put his son first in his life. Tim's passing is a tragedy
2 but the memories of his love, loyalty, friendship, and the laughter and joy he brought into people's
3 lives every day will live forever in the hearts and minds of his family and many friends; and;
4 WHEREAS, Timothy Phillips leaves behind his son, Devin Phillips, his parents, the
5 Honorable Robert Phillips and Nancy Phillips, and his twin brother Matt Phillips. He also leaves
6 behind Devin's mother, Brittany Eldridge, as well as his nephew, Skylar Ryan, and his
7 grandmother Margaret Ottman. He was the grandson of the late Richard Phillips, Sr., and Virginia
8 Phillips; now, therefore be it
9 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
10 expresses its condolences to the Phillips Family on the passing of Timothy R. Phillips; and be it
11 further
12 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
13 transmit a duly certified copy of this resolution to the Honorable Robert Phillips, his wife Nancy
14 Phillips and the Phillips Family.
