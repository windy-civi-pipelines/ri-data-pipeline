13 international hydroelectric power to New England load centers that will benefit the state of Rhode
14 Island and its ratepayers, and such solicitations may be issued by the New England States
15 Committee on Electricity or the electric or natural gas distribution company to further the purposes
16 of this chapter;
17 (2) Participate in the development and issuance of state, regional, or multistate competitive
18 solicitation(s) for the development and construction of regional electric-transmission projects that

1 would allow for the reliable transmission of eligible renewable energy resources, including offshore
2 wind, as defined by § 39-26-5(a), to New England load centers that will benefit the state of Rhode
3 Island and its ratepayers, and the solicitations may be issued by the New England States Committee
4 on Electricity or the electric or natural gas distribution company to further the purposes of this
