It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Section 9-19-34.1 of the General Laws in Chapter 9-19 entitled "Evidence"

6 maintenance organization, professional service corporation providing health care services under
7 chapter 5.1 of title 7, dentist, or dental hygienist based upon professional negligence, the defendant
8 may introduce evidence of any amount payable as a benefit to the plaintiff as a result of the personal
9 injury pursuant to any state income disability or workers’ compensation act, any health, sickness
10 or income disability insurance, accident insurance that provides health benefits or income disability
11 coverage, and any contract or agreement of any group, organization, partnership, or corporation to

13 Where the defendant elects to introduce such evidence, the plaintiff may introduce evidence of any
14 amount which the plaintiff has paid or contributed to secure his or her right to any insurance benefits
15 concerning which the defendant has introduced evidence. When such evidence is introduced, the
16 jury shall be instructed to reduce the award for damages by a sum equal to the difference between
17 the total benefits received and the total amount paid to secure the benefits by the plaintiff or the
18 court may ascertain the sum by special interrogatory and reduce the award for damages after

2 benefit against the judgment shall be foreclosed and the plaintiff shall have no legal obligation to
3 reimburse the payor.
4 SECTION 2. This act shall take effect upon passage.
