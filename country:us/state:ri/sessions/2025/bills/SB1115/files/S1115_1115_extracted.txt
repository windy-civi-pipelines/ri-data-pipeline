17 or distribution of raw materials, such as alteration of stock for the convenience of a customer; are
18 excluded from this definition;
19 (ii) For the purposes of this section and §§ 44-4-10 and 44-5-38, the term “manufacturer’s
20 inventory,” or any similar term, means and includes the manufacturer’s raw materials, the

28 in this state consists of transforming raw materials into a finished product for trade through any or
29 all of the operations described in paragraph (i) of this subdivision. A person will be deemed to be
30 principally engaged if the gross receipts that person derived from the manufacturing operations in

32 fifty percent (50%) of the total gross receipts that person derived from all the business activities in

LC002960 - Page 4 of 16
1 products manufactured by the manufacturer in this state, even though the manufacturer’s store or
2 other selling place may be at a different location from the location of the manufacturer’s

9 revised from time to time, but eliminating as manufacturers those persons, who, because of their
10 limited type of manufacturing activities, are classified in the manual as falling within the trade
11 rather than an industrial classification of manufacturers. Among those thus eliminated, and
12 accordingly also excluded as manufacturers within the meaning of this paragraph, are persons
13 primarily engaged in selling, to the general public, products produced on the premises from which
14 they are sold, such as neighborhood bakeries, candy stores, ice cream parlors, shade shops, and
15 custom tailors, except, that a person who manufactures bakery products for sale primarily for home

25 reconstructed, erected, installed, or acquired in furtherance of federal or state requirements or

29 management; provided, that any grant of the exemption by the director of environmental
30 management in excess of ten (10) years is approved by the city or town in which the property is

33 processing; furthermore, it applies only to water or air pollution control properties and facilities
34 placed in operation for the first time after April 13, 1970;

11 equipment is used for the manufacturing processes, research and development, or quality assurance.
12 In the instances where machinery and equipment is used in both manufacturing and/or research and
13 development and/or quality assurance activities and non-manufacturing activities, the assessment
14 on machinery and equipment is prorated by applying the percentage of usage of the equipment for
15 the manufacturing, research and development, and quality-assurance activity to the value of the
16 machinery and equipment for purposes of taxation, and the portion of the value used for
17 manufacturing, research and development, and quality assurance is exempt from taxation. The
18 burden of demonstrating this percentage usage of machinery and equipment for manufacturing and
19 for research and development and/or quality assurance of its manufactured products rests with the
20 manufacturer; and
21 (iii) Machinery and equipment described in §§ 44-18-30(7) and 44-18-30(22) that was
22 purchased after July 1, 1997; provided that the city or town council of the city or town in which the

24 from taxation. For purposes of this subsection, city councils and town councils of any municipality
25 may, by ordinance, wholly or partially exempt from taxation the machinery and equipment
26 discussed in this subsection for the period of time established in the ordinance and may, by
27 ordinance, establish the procedures for taxpayers to avail themselves of the benefit of any
28 exemption permitted under this section; provided, that the ordinance does not apply to any
29 machinery or equipment of a business, subsidiary, or any affiliated business that locates or relocates
30 from a city or town in this state to another city or town in the state;
31 (23) Precious metal bullion, meaning any elementary metal that has been put through a
32 process of melting or refining, and that is in a state or condition that its value depends upon its
33 content and not its form. The term does not include fabricated precious metal that has been
34 processed or manufactured for some one or more specific and customary industrial, professional,
LC002960 - Page 6 of 16
1 or artistic uses;

18 are generated primarily by the same taxpayer and where the personal property is located at, in, or
19 adjacent to a generating facility of the taxpayer. The taxpayer may, but need not, procure an order
20 from the director of the department of environmental management certifying that the tangible
21 personal property has this function, which order effects a conclusive presumption that the tangible
22 personal property qualifies for the exemption under this subdivision. If any information relating to
23 secret processes or methods of manufacture, production, or treatment is disclosed to the department
24 of environmental management only to procure an order, and is a “trade secret” as defined in § 28-

12 In the instances where machinery and equipment is used in both manufacturing and/or research and
13 development and/or quality assurance activities and non-manufacturing activities, the assessment
14 on machinery and equipment is prorated by applying the percentage of usage of the equipment for
15 the manufacturing, research and development, and quality-assurance activity to the value of the
16 machinery and equipment for purposes of taxation, and the portion of the value used for
17 manufacturing, research and development, and quality assurance is exempt from taxation. The
18 burden of demonstrating this percentage usage of machinery and equipment for manufacturing and
19 for research and development and/or quality assurance of its manufactured products rests with the
20 manufacturer; and
21 (iii) Machinery and equipment described in §§ 44-18-30(7) and 44-18-30(22) that was
22 purchased after July 1, 1997; provided that the city or town council of the city or town in which the
23 machinery and equipment is located adopts an ordinance exempting the machinery and equipment
24 from taxation. For purposes of this subsection, city councils and town councils of any municipality
25 may, by ordinance, wholly or partially exempt from taxation the machinery and equipment
26 discussed in this subsection for the period of time established in the ordinance and may, by
27 ordinance, establish the procedures for taxpayers to avail themselves of the benefit of any
28 exemption permitted under this section; provided, that the ordinance does not apply to any
29 machinery or equipment of a business, subsidiary, or any affiliated business that locates or relocates
30 from a city or town in this state to another city or town in the state;
31 (23) Precious metal bullion, meaning any elementary metal that has been put through a

19 adjacent to a generating facility of the taxpayer. The taxpayer may, but need not, procure an order
20 from the director of the department of environmental management certifying that the tangible
