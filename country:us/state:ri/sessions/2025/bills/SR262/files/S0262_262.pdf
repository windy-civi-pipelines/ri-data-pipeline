Date Introduced: February 13, 2025
Referred To: Senate Finance
1 WHEREAS, Domestic abuse and sexual violence are public health issues of epidemic
2 proportions in Rhode Island and throughout the United States, affecting approximately one in
3 four women and one in seven men, with rates comparable or even higher among the LGBTQ+
4 population; and
5 WHEREAS, The absence of safe, secure, affordable housing is one of the largest barriers
6 for individuals who are experiencing abuse to flee from a dangerous situation; and
7 WHEREAS, The development of affordable housing in Rhode Island continues to lag
8 behind the need for such resources; and
9 WHEREAS, The development of programs that provide safe, affordable, confidential
10 housing to victims of abuse while joined with supportive services are still scarce, even at the
11 national level; and
12 WHEREAS, Sojourner House in Rhode Island has developed a robust permanent
13 supportive housing program that provides critical, life-saving interventions to families who have
14 experienced abuse, and provides them with the support to rebuild their lives, including over 150
15 units that are available in 33 cities and towns statewide; and
16 WHEREAS, Sojourner House serves almost 2,000 unduplicated clients a year throughout
17 their programs, but the demand for services far exceeds their ability to meet the need; and
18 WHEREAS, Sojourner House brings in approximately $10,000,000 in federal grants to
19 support its work and these grants require local matching funds; and

1 WHERAS, Sojourner House seeks a partnership with the State of Rhode Island to secure
2 matching funds for federal grants, ensuring continued support for permanent housing for abuse
3 victims in Rhode Island; now, therefore be it
4 RESOLVED, That there is hereby appropriated, out of any money in the treasury not
5 otherwise appropriated for the fiscal year 2025-2026, the sum of five hundred thousand dollars
6 ($500,000) to support Sojourner Houseâ€™s permanent supportive housing development program,
7 including, but not limited to, the acquisition and rehabilitation of residential buildings that will
8 provide safe, secure housing to individuals and families who are fleeing from dangerous
9 situations to rebuild their lives; and the state controller is hereby authorized and directed to draw
10 his orders upon the general treasurer for payment of said sum, or so much thereof as may be from
11 time to time be required, upon receipt of properly authenticated vouchers.
