Date Introduced: February 11, 2025
Referred To: Recommended for Immediate Consideration
1 WHEREAS, It is with sadness that this Senate has learned of the passing of Marie T.
2 Nesselbush, the beloved wife of Donald Nesselbush, whom she had married twice, and the wife
3 of the late Steven Viti; and
4 WHEREAS, Blessed with a large family, Mrs. Nesselbush was the cherished mother of
5 our former colleague, the Honorable Donna Nesselbush and her wife, Kelly Carse, and her sons,
6 Carl, Gerald and his wife, Laurie, the late Thomas Nesselbush, grandchildren, Lindsey
7 Nesselbush Owen, Cory Nesselbush, Kelli Nesselbush, and Jaime Nesselbush, and five great-
8 grandchildren; and
9 WHEREAS, Marie Nesselbush was born in Buffalo, New York, the daughter of
10 Genevieve and the late Frank Springer, the sister of the late Lorraine Kruzel, and the aunt to
11 many nieces and nephews including, Michael Kruzel and his wife, Leondra, Susan Kruzel
12 Alessandra and her husband, Craig, Tim Kruzel and his wife, Lori, Kathy Kruzel Smith and her
13 husband, Kevin, and many great nieces and nephews; and
14 WHEREAS, In her early 20s, Mrs. Nesselbush was crowned a “beauty queen” and had
15 been employed as a secretary for many years before retiring. She resided in Wappingers Falls and
16 Baldwinsville, New York, and later returned to Buffalo until she moved to Steere House, to be
17 near her daughter; and
18 WHEREAS, Mrs. Nesselbush was a longtime resident of Steere House, and had earned
19 the honor of being the longest reigning resident in the home’s history, and the intriguing

1 Williams and Carmen Garcia, as well as Costella and Akua, who had all provided her with loving
2 and tender care; and
3 WHEREAS, An avid Buffalo Bills fan, Mrs. Nesselbush happily lived to see her beloved
4 team win their playoff game, and was surrounded by her loving family at her passing; and
5 WHEREAS, Marie Nesselbush was “an elegant woman who lit up the room” with a true
6 zest for life. She loved red wine, a good cigarette, and a fun party, and could “bang out a mean
7 jitterbug”, and she is dearly missed by all who were a part of her glorious life; now, therefore be
8 it
9 RESOLVED, That this Senate of the State of Rhode Island hereby expresses its deepest
10 sympathy on the passing of Marie T. Nesselbush; and be it further
11 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
