23 insurance market, as defined in chapter 50 of title 27, in accordance with the following:
24 (1) The analysis shall forecast the likely rate increases required to effect the changes
25 recommended pursuant to the preceding subsection (g) in the direct-pay market and small-employer

27 current products.
28 (2) The analysis shall include examining the impact of merging the individual and small-
29 employer markets on premiums charged to individuals and small-employer groups.
30 (3) The analysis shall include examining the impact on rates in each of the individual and
31 small-employer health insurance markets and the number of insureds in the context of possible
32 changes to the rating guidelines used for small-employer groups, including: community rating

3 merged market.
4 (5) The analysis shall include assessment of possible reinsurance mechanisms and/or
5 federal high-risk pool structures and funding to support the health insurance market in Rhode Island
6 by reducing the risk of adverse selection and the incremental insurance premiums charged for this
7 risk, and/or by making health insurance affordable for a selected at-risk population.
8 (6) The health insurance commissioner shall work with an insurance market merger task
9 force to assist with the analysis. The task force shall be chaired by the health insurance
10 commissioner and shall include, but not be limited to, representatives of the general assembly, the
11 business community, small-employer carriers as defined in § 27-50-3, carriers offering coverage in

16 data shall be subject to state and federal laws and regulations governing confidentiality of health
17 care and proprietary information.
18 (8) The task force shall meet as necessary and include its findings in the annual report, and
19 the commissioner shall include the information in the annual presentation before the house and

21 (h) To establish and convene a workgroup representing healthcare providers and health
22 insurers for the purpose of coordinating the development of processes, guidelines, and standards to
23 streamline healthcare administration that are to be adopted by payors and providers of healthcare
24 services operating in the state. This workgroup shall include representatives with expertise who
25 would contribute to the streamlining of healthcare administration and who are selected from
26 hospitals, physician practices, community behavioral health organizations, each health insurer, and
27 other affected entities. The workgroup shall also include at least one designee each from the Rhode
28 Island Medical Society, Rhode Island Council of Community Mental Health Organizations, the

31 commissioner, the office of the health insurance commissioner shall submit such recommendations
32 to the health and human services committees of the Rhode Island house of representatives and the
33 Rhode Island senate prior to the implementation of any such recommendations and subsequently
34 shall submit a report to the general assembly by June 30, 2024. The report shall include the
LC000456 - Page 13 of 22
1 recommendations the commissioner may implement, with supporting rationale. The workgroup
2 shall consider and make recommendations for:
3 (1) Establishing a consistent standard for electronic eligibility and coverage verification.

6 consistent with the standards adopted by nationally recognized organizations, such as the Centers
7 for Medicare & Medicaid Services;
8 (ii) Enable providers and payors to exchange eligibility requests and responses on a system-
9 to-system basis or using a payor-supported web browser;
10 (iii) Provide reasonably detailed information on a consumer’s eligibility for healthcare
11 coverage; scope of benefits; limitations and exclusions provided under that coverage; cost-sharing
12 requirements for specific services at the specific time of the inquiry; current deductible amounts;
13 accumulated or limited benefits; out-of-pocket maximums; any maximum policy amounts; and
14 other information required for the provider to collect the patient’s portion of the bill;
15 (iv) Reflect the necessary limitations imposed on payors by the originator of the eligibility
16 and benefits information;
17 (v) Recommend a standard or common process to protect all providers from the costs of
18 services to patients who are ineligible for insurance coverage in circumstances where a payor
19 provides eligibility verification based on best information available to the payor at the date of the
20 request of eligibility.
21 (2) Developing implementation guidelines and promoting adoption of the guidelines for:
22 (i) The use of the National Correct Coding Initiative code-edit policy by payors and
23 providers in the state;
24 (ii) Publishing any variations from codes and mutually exclusive codes by payors in a
25 manner that makes for simple retrieval and implementation by providers;
26 (iii) Use of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act standard group codes,
27 reason codes, and remark codes by payors in electronic remittances sent to providers;
28 (iv) Uniformity in the processing of claims by payors; and the processing of corrections to
29 claims by providers and payors;
30 (v) A standard payor-denial review process for providers when they request a
31 reconsideration of a denial of a claim that results from differences in clinical edits where no single,
32 common-standards body or process exists and multiple conflicting sources are in use by payors and
33 providers.
34 (vi) Nothing in this section, nor in the guidelines developed, shall inhibit an individual
LC000456 - Page 14 of 22
1 payor’s ability to employ, and not disclose to providers, temporary code edits for the purpose of
2 detecting and deterring fraudulent billing activities. The guidelines shall require that each payor
3 disclose to the provider its adjudication decision on a claim that was denied or adjusted based on
4 the application of such edits and that the provider have access to the payor’s review and appeal
5 process to challenge the payor’s adjudication decision.
6 (vii) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to modify the rights or obligations of
7 payors or providers with respect to procedures relating to the investigation, reporting, appeal, or
8 prosecution under applicable law of potentially fraudulent billing activities.
9 (3) Developing and promoting widespread adoption by payors and providers of guidelines
10 to:
11 (i) Ensure payors do not automatically deny claims for services when extenuating
12 circumstances make it impossible for the provider to obtain a preauthorization before services are
13 performed or notify a payor within an appropriate standardized timeline of a patient’s admission;
14 (ii) Require payors to use common and consistent processes and time frames when
15 responding to provider requests for medical management approvals. Whenever possible, such time
16 frames shall be consistent with those established by leading national organizations and be based
17 upon the acuity of the patient’s need for care or treatment. For the purposes of this section, medical
18 management includes prior authorization of services, preauthorization of services, precertification
19 of services, post-service review, medical-necessity review, and benefits advisory;
20 (iii) Develop, maintain, and promote widespread adoption of a single, common website
21 where providers can obtain payors’ preauthorization, benefits advisory, and preadmission
22 requirements;
23 (iv) Establish guidelines for payors to develop and maintain a website that providers can
24 use to request a preauthorization, including a prospective clinical necessity review; receive an
25 authorization number; and transmit an admission notification;
26 (v) Develop and implement the use of programs that implement selective prior
27 authorization requirements, based on stratification of healthcare providers’ performance and
28 adherence to evidence-based medicine with the input of contracted healthcare providers and/or
29 provider organizations. Such criteria shall be transparent and easily accessible to contracted
30 providers. Such selective prior authorization programs shall be available when healthcare providers
31 participate directly with the insurer in risk-based payment contracts and may be available to
32 providers who do not participate in risk-based contracts;
33 (vi) Require the review of medical services, including behavioral health services, and
34 prescription drugs, subject to prior authorization on at least an annual basis, with the input of
LC000456 - Page 15 of 22
1 contracted healthcare providers and/or provider organizations. Any changes to the list of medical
2 services, including behavioral health services, and prescription drugs requiring prior authorization,
3 shall be shared via provider-accessible websites;
4 (vii) Improve communication channels between health plans, healthcare providers, and
5 patients by:
6 (A) Requiring transparency and easy accessibility of prior authorization requirements,
7 criteria, rationale, and program changes to contracted healthcare providers and patients/health plan
8 enrollees which may be satisfied by posting to provider-accessible and member-accessible
9 websites; and
10 (B) Supporting:
11 (I) Timely submission by healthcare providers of the complete information necessary to
12 make a prior authorization determination, as early in the process as possible; and
13 (II) Timely notification of prior authorization determinations by health plans to impacted
14 health plan enrollees, and healthcare providers, including, but not limited to, ordering providers,
15 and/or rendering providers, and dispensing pharmacists which may be satisfied by posting to
16 provider-accessible websites or similar electronic portals or services;
17 (viii) Increase and strengthen continuity of patient care by:
18 (A) Defining protections for continuity of care during a transition period for patients
19 undergoing an active course of treatment, when there is a formulary or treatment coverage change
20 or change of health plan that may disrupt their current course of treatment and when the treating
21 physician determines that a transition may place the patient at risk; and for prescription medication
22 by allowing a grace period of coverage to allow consideration of referred health plan options or
23 establishment of medical necessity of the current course of treatment;
24 (B) Requiring continuity of care for medical services, including behavioral health services,
25 and prescription medications for patients on appropriate, chronic, stable therapy through
26 minimizing repetitive prior authorization requirements; and which for prescription medication shall
27 be allowed only on an annual review, with exception for labeled limitation, to establish continued
28 benefit of treatment; and
29 (C) Requiring communication between healthcare providers, health plans, and patients to
30 facilitate continuity of care and minimize disruptions in needed treatment which may be satisfied
31 by posting to provider-accessible websites or similar electronic portals or services;
32 (D) Continuity of care for formulary or drug coverage shall distinguish between FDA
33 designated interchangeable products and proprietary or marketed versions of a medication;
34 (ix) Encourage healthcare providers and/or provider organizations and health plans to

33 Rhode Island senate prior to the implementation of any such recommendations and subsequently
34 shall submit a report to the general assembly by June 30, 2024. The report shall include the
LC000456 - Page 13 of 22

1 recommendations the commissioner may implement, with supporting rationale. The workgroup
2 shall consider and make recommendations for:
3 (1) Establishing a consistent standard for electronic eligibility and coverage verification.

6 consistent with the standards adopted by nationally recognized organizations, such as the Centers
7 for Medicare & Medicaid Services;
8 (ii) Enable providers and payors to exchange eligibility requests and responses on a system-
9 to-system basis or using a payor-supported web browser;

11 coverage; scope of benefits; limitations and exclusions provided under that coverage; cost-sharing
12 requirements for specific services at the specific time of the inquiry; current deductible amounts;
13 accumulated or limited benefits; out-of-pocket maximums; any maximum policy amounts; and
14 other information required for the provider to collect the patient’s portion of the bill;
15 (iv) Reflect the necessary limitations imposed on payors by the originator of the eligibility
16 and benefits information;
17 (v) Recommend a standard or common process to protect all providers from the costs of
18 services to patients who are ineligible for insurance coverage in circumstances where a payor
19 provides eligibility verification based on best information available to the payor at the date of the
20 request of eligibility.
21 (2) Developing implementation guidelines and promoting adoption of the guidelines for:
22 (i) The use of the National Correct Coding Initiative code-edit policy by payors and

25 manner that makes for simple retrieval and implementation by providers;
26 (iii) Use of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act standard group codes,
27 reason codes, and remark codes by payors in electronic remittances sent to providers;
28 (iv) Uniformity in the processing of claims by payors; and the processing of corrections to
29 claims by providers and payors;
30 (v) A standard payor-denial review process for providers when they request a
31 reconsideration of a denial of a claim that results from differences in clinical edits where no single,
32 common-standards body or process exists and multiple conflicting sources are in use by payors and
33 providers.
34 (vi) Nothing in this section, nor in the guidelines developed, shall inhibit an individual
LC000456 - Page 14 of 22

1 payor’s ability to employ, and not disclose to providers, temporary code edits for the purpose of
2 detecting and deterring fraudulent billing activities. The guidelines shall require that each payor

4 the application of such edits and that the provider have access to the payor’s review and appeal
5 process to challenge the payor’s adjudication decision.
6 (vii) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to modify the rights or obligations of
7 payors or providers with respect to procedures relating to the investigation, reporting, appeal, or
8 prosecution under applicable law of potentially fraudulent billing activities.
9 (3) Developing and promoting widespread adoption by payors and providers of guidelines
10 to:

12 circumstances make it impossible for the provider to obtain a preauthorization before services are
13 performed or notify a payor within an appropriate standardized timeline of a patient’s admission;
14 (ii) Require payors to use common and consistent processes and time frames when
15 responding to provider requests for medical management approvals. Whenever possible, such time
16 frames shall be consistent with those established by leading national organizations and be based
17 upon the acuity of the patient’s need for care or treatment. For the purposes of this section, medical
18 management includes prior authorization of services, preauthorization of services, precertification
19 of services, post-service review, medical-necessity review, and benefits advisory;
20 (iii) Develop, maintain, and promote widespread adoption of a single, common website
21 where providers can obtain payors’ preauthorization, benefits advisory, and preadmission
22 requirements;
23 (iv) Establish guidelines for payors to develop and maintain a website that providers can
24 use to request a preauthorization, including a prospective clinical necessity review; receive an
25 authorization number; and transmit an admission notification;
26 (v) Develop and implement the use of programs that implement selective prior
27 authorization requirements, based on stratification of healthcare providers’ performance and
28 adherence to evidence-based medicine with the input of contracted healthcare providers and/or
29 provider organizations. Such criteria shall be transparent and easily accessible to contracted
30 providers. Such selective prior authorization programs shall be available when healthcare providers
31 participate directly with the insurer in risk-based payment contracts and may be available to
32 providers who do not participate in risk-based contracts;
33 (vi) Require the review of medical services, including behavioral health services, and
34 prescription drugs, subject to prior authorization on at least an annual basis, with the input of
LC000456 - Page 15 of 22

1 contracted healthcare providers and/or provider organizations. Any changes to the list of medical
2 services, including behavioral health services, and prescription drugs requiring prior authorization,
3 shall be shared via provider-accessible websites;
4 (vii) Improve communication channels between health plans, healthcare providers, and
5 patients by:
6 (A) Requiring transparency and easy accessibility of prior authorization requirements,
7 criteria, rationale, and program changes to contracted healthcare providers and patients/health plan
8 enrollees which may be satisfied by posting to provider-accessible and member-accessible
9 websites; and
10 (B) Supporting:
11 (I) Timely submission by healthcare providers of the complete information necessary to
12 make a prior authorization determination, as early in the process as possible; and
13 (II) Timely notification of prior authorization determinations by health plans to impacted
14 health plan enrollees, and healthcare providers, including, but not limited to, ordering providers,
15 and/or rendering providers, and dispensing pharmacists which may be satisfied by posting to
16 provider-accessible websites or similar electronic portals or services;
17 (viii) Increase and strengthen continuity of patient care by:
18 (A) Defining protections for continuity of care during a transition period for patients
19 undergoing an active course of treatment, when there is a formulary or treatment coverage change
20 or change of health plan that may disrupt their current course of treatment and when the treating
21 physician determines that a transition may place the patient at risk; and for prescription medication
22 by allowing a grace period of coverage to allow consideration of referred health plan options or
23 establishment of medical necessity of the current course of treatment;
24 (B) Requiring continuity of care for medical services, including behavioral health services,
25 and prescription medications for patients on appropriate, chronic, stable therapy through
26 minimizing repetitive prior authorization requirements; and which for prescription medication shall
27 be allowed only on an annual review, with exception for labeled limitation, to establish continued
28 benefit of treatment; and
29 (C) Requiring communication between healthcare providers, health plans, and patients to
30 facilitate continuity of care and minimize disruptions in needed treatment which may be satisfied
31 by posting to provider-accessible websites or similar electronic portals or services;
32 (D) Continuity of care for formulary or drug coverage shall distinguish between FDA
33 designated interchangeable products and proprietary or marketed versions of a medication;
34 (ix) Encourage healthcare providers and/or provider organizations and health plans to
