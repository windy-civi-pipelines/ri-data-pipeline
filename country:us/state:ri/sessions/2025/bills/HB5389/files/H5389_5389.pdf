13 section.
14 (b) For FY 2007, the department shall dedicate one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000)
15 from funds appropriated to support progressive support and intervention and SALT visits to support
16 the Rhode Island Consortium for Instructional Leadership and Training. This consortium is
17 engaged in training school leaders to be more effective instructional leaders in the standards based
18 instruction environment.
19 (c) The director of revenue shall appoint a fiscal overseer if a school or school district is
