2 is hereby amended by adding thereto the following chapter:
3 CHAPTER 65.4
4 RESIDENTIAL CONTRACTOR LICENSING
5 5-65.4-1. Short title and purpose.
6 This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Rhode Island residential contractor
7 licensing law" to safeguard the public health, the purpose of this chapter is to establish a licensing
8 program and minimum standards for contractors supervising or performing structural work in
9 residences of one to four (4) family dwelling units.
10 5-65.4-2. Definitions.
11 Unless specified otherwise, the definitions of ยง 5-65-1 shall apply to this chapter. As used
12 in this chapter:
13 (1) "Board" means the contractors' registration and licensing board established in chapter
14 65 of title 5.
15 (2) "Residential structure" means a building consisting of one to four (4) family dwelling
16 units.
17 (3) "Structurally remodeling" means work performed by a contractor identified by the
18 board as impacting components that support a building's safety or integrity, and any other work

1 identified by the board that requires permits and/or inspections under the state building code.
2 (4) "Supervising construction" means the performance, management, guidance or oversight
3 of the physical development of structures.
4 5-65.4-3. Licensing.
5 (a) In addition to the provisions of chapter 65 of title 5, the contractors' registration and
6 licensing board is authorized to establish a program to license contractors that supervise the
7 construction of new residential structures, or structurally remodel existing residential structures, to
8 ensure persons performing such are properly qualified to conduct the work. As determined by the
9 contractors' registration and licensing board, contractors only performing nonstructural home
10 improvement work shall remain subject exclusively to the registration system in chapter 65 of title
11 5.
12 (b) The license program shall not create an unreasonable barrier to entry nor inhibit trade
13 or competition, but shall be designed to advance consumer protection by establishing a standard of
14 competency and enhance ongoing adherence to building standards and codes through continuing
15 education, code competency demonstrations, or industry training programing. The board may
16 create a reasonable license pathway or substantive evidence standard to issue licenses to contractors
17 registered prior to January 1, 2026, but it shall not be a grandfathering based solely on registration
18 status prior to January 1, 2026.
19 (c) The board may adopt, for licenses granted under this chapter, any policy or procedure
20 applicable to registrations under chapter 65 of title 5 that does not conflict with the provisions of
21 this chapter; provided, however, that any penalties issued pursuant to this chapter shall be
22 determined by the board and the state building office shall assist the board with the administration
23 of such penalties.
24 (d) On or before January 1, 2026, the contractors' registration and licensing board shall
25 promulgate regulations to establish a licensing program for:
26 (i) Supervising construction of new residential structures; and
27 (ii) Structurally remodeling of existing residential structures.
28 (e) Beginning on January 1, 2027, no person shall supervise the construction of a new
29 residential structure or structurally remodel an existing residential structure without proper
30 licensure from the contractors' registration and licensing board. A license issued by the board to a
31 contractor under this chapter shall serve to fulfill the contractor registration requirements of chapter
32 65 of title 5.
33 (f) Pursuant to board regulations, all persons seeking to be licensed as a new residential
34 structure construction supervisor or residential construction remodeler as defined herein shall
