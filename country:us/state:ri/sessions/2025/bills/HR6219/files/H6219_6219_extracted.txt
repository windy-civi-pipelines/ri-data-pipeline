YEAR OF THE SNAKE" ON APRIL 14-16, 2025
Introduced By: Representatives Slater, Shekarchi, Blazejewski, Diaz, Chippendale,
Morales, Kennedy, Ajello, Cortvriend, and Bennett
Date Introduced: April 10, 2025
Referred To: House read and passed
1 WHEREAS, One of the most important and popular of Cambodian holidays, ushering in
2 the New Year, is Choul Chnam Thmey, which literally means "Enter the New Year." It occurs
3 from April 14th through the 16th and marks the end of the harvesting season; and
4 WHEREAS, Each Cambodian year is popularly known by one of the 12 animals of the
5 Zodiac. These names provide a ready reference because each is used only once in 12 years. This
6 year, 2025, will be celebrated as "The Year of the Snake"; and
7 WHEREAS, The holiday celebration is a three-day event that begins on New Year’s Day.
8 Moha Sangkran is the first day of the event and symbolizes the ending of one year and beginning
9 anew. Cambodians traditionally clean and decorate their homes and prepare food for the New
10 Year inauguration and to welcome the "New Angels at every single home"; and
11 WHEREAS, Day two of the Cambodian New Year's celebration is Wanabot. It is a time
12 to offer gifts to one's parents, grandparents, and elders, and to contribute to charity and help those
13 less fortunate; and
14 WHEREAS, The third day of the New Year's celebration is called Thhnay Leung Sakk,
15 which means the year "starts to be counted from this day." People generally go to temple in the
16 morning and end the day with the "Pithi Srang Preah" where they cleanse the Buddha statues and
17 their monks, elders, parents, and grandparents as an act of contrition to apologize for any
18 transgressions done to them; and
19 WHEREAS, The Cambodian New Year's holiday is rich with tradition and a perfectly
1 wonderful time for men and women, both young and old, to come together and celebrate; now,
2 therefore, be it
3 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
4 recognizes the celebration of the Cambodian New Year and the "Year of the Snake" on April 14-
5 16, 2025; and be it further
6 RESOLVED, That this House hereby wishes to extend its deepest respect and
7 appreciation to the Rhode Island Cambodian community for all that it has contributed to the rich
8 diversity of Rhode Island culture; and be it further
9 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
10 transmit a duly certified copy of this resolution to Suonriaksmay Keo, President of the
11 Cambodian Society of Rhode Island, Inc.
