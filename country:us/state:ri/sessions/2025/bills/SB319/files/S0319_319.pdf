33 CHAPTER 16-91
34 School and Youth Programs Concussion Act
LC001566 - Page 4 of 7

1 16-91-1. Findings of fact.
2 The general assembly hereby finds and declares: (1) Concussions are one of the most
3 commonly reported injuries in children and adolescents who participate in sports and recreational
4 activities. A concussion is caused by a blow or motion to the head or body that causes the brain to
5 move rapidly inside the skull. The risk of catastrophic injuries or death is significant when a
6 concussion or head injury is not properly evaluated and managed.
7 (2) Concussions are a type of brain injury that can range from mild to severe and can disrupt
8 the way the brain normally works. Concussions can occur in any organized or unorganized sport
9 or recreational activity and can result from a fall or from players colliding with each other, the
10 ground, or with obstacles. Concussions occur with or without loss of consciousness, but the vast
11 majority occurs without loss of consciousness.
12 (3) Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of a head injury leaves the young
13 athlete especially vulnerable to greater injury and even death. The general assembly also recognizes
14 that, despite having generally recognized return-to-play standards for concussion and head injury,
15 some affected youth athletes are prematurely returned to play resulting in actual or potential
16 physical injury or death to youth athletes in the state of Rhode Island.
17 (4) Concussions can occur in any sport or recreational activity, furthermore, symptoms of
18 concussions may manifest themselves after the injury during school hours and in the classroom
19 setting. All school nurses, coaches, parents, and athletes shall be advised of the signs and symptoms
20 of concussions as well as the protocol for treatment.
21 16-91-2. Definitions.
22 For the purpose of this section, the term “youth sports programs” means any program
23 organized for recreational and/or athletic competition purposes by any school district or by any
24 school participating in Rhode Island Interscholastic League Competition, and whose participants
25 are nineteen (19) years of age or younger.
26 16-91-3. School district’s guidelines to be developed and implemented.
27 (a) The department of education and the department of health shall work in concert with
28 the Rhode Island Interscholastic League to develop and promulgate guidelines to inform and
29 educate coaches, teachers, school nurses, youth athletes, and their parents and/or guardians of the
30 nature and risk of concussion and head injury, including continuing to play after concussion or head
31 injury. A concussion and head injury information sheet shall be signed and returned by the youth
32 athlete and the athlete’s parent and/or guardian prior to the youth athlete’s return to practice or
33 competition.
34 (b) School districts are required to use training materials made available by the United
LC001566 - Page 5 of 7

1 States Center for Disease Control and Prevention entitled “Heads Up: Concussion in the High
2 School Sports/Concussion in Youth Sports” and any updates or amendments thereto, or training
3 materials substantively and substantially similar thereto. The department of education shall post
4 training materials made available by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the Rhode
5 Island Interscholastic League on its website. All coaches and volunteers involved in a youth sport
6 or activity covered by this chapter must complete a training course and a refresher course annually
7 thereafter in concussions and traumatic brain injuries. All school nurses must complete a training
8 course and an annual refresher course in concussions and traumatic brain injuries. Teachers and
9 teachers’ aides are strongly encouraged to complete the training course in concussions and
10 traumatic brain injuries. Training may consist of videos, classes, and any other generally accepted
11 mode and medium of providing information.
12 (c) School districts are encouraged to have all student athletes perform baseline
13 neuropsychological testing, computerized or otherwise. Parents and/or guardians shall be provided
14 with information as to the risk of concussion and/or traumatic brain injuries prior to the start of
15 every sport season and they shall sign an acknowledgement as to their receipt of such information.
16 (d) A youth athlete, who is suspected of sustaining a concussion or head injury in a practice
17 or game, shall be removed from competition at that time.
18 (e) A youth athlete, who has been removed from play, may not return to play until the
19 athlete is evaluated by a licensed physician who may consult with an athletic trainer, all of whom
20 shall be trained in the evaluation and management of concussions. The athlete must receive written
21 clearance to return to play from that licensed physician.
22 (f) All school districts are encouraged to have an athletic trainer, or similarly trained
23 person, at all recreational and athletic events addressed by this statute.
24 16-91-4. All other youth sports program.
25 All other youth sports programs not specifically addressed by this statute are encouraged
26 to follow the guidance set forth in this statute for all program participants who are age nineteen
27 (19) and younger.
28 SECTION 3. This act shall take effect on July 1, 2025.
