STATE OF RHODE ISLAND
Introduced By: Representatives Azzinaro, Shekarchi, Blazejewski, Chippendale,

Date Introduced: May 15, 2025
Referred To: House read and passed
1 WHEREAS, Armed Forces Day is celebrated each year on the third Saturday in May. It
2 was created on August 31, 1949, thanks to the efforts of President Harry S. Truman to create a
3 holiday in honor of all Americans serving in the Armed Forces, which include the United States
4 Army, the United States Navy, the United States Marine Corps, the United States Air Force, the
5 United States Coast Guard, and the United States Space Force; and
6 WHEREAS, As of 2023, there were more than 1.32 million active personnel and
7 approximately 766,044 reserve personnel serving our nation across the globe. These patriots serve
8 our nation with honor and bravery and often face hostile life-risking situations, and sacrifice
9 everyday to secure the very freedoms our citizens cherish. They serve in challenging climates and
10 their families are often required to frequently move and set up life in new communities,
11 sometimes at a momentâ€™s notice. Also, in some instances, a service member is separated from
12 their family for a lengthy period of time; and
13 WHEREAS, Armed Forces Day is enthusiastically celebrated each year across the nation
14 with parades, open houses, receptions, air shows, meet-and-greet opportunities, and educational
15 programs that allow all Americans to show their appreciation for our Armed Forces personnel and
16 everything they do daily to serve and protect our nation; now, therefore be it
17 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
18 heartily honors and celebrates "Armed Forces Day" on May 17th, 2025, and thanks each and
19 every member of the United States military for their service and for the sacrifices they make for

1 our nation; and be it further
2 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
3 transmit a duly certified copy of this resolution to the Rhode Island Adjutant General, Brigadier
4 General Andrew J. Chevalier.
