9 (2) Notwithstanding the terms, provisions, or conditions of any franchise or the terms or
10 provisions of any waiver, good cause shall exist for the purposes of a termination, cancellation, or
11 nonrenewal when:
12 (i) There is a failure by the new motor vehicle dealer to comply with a provision of the
13 franchise, which provision is both reasonable and of material significance to the franchise
14 relationship, provided that the dealer has been notified, in writing, of the failure within one hundred
15 eighty (180) days after the manufacturer, distributor or factory branch first acquired knowledge of
16 that failure;
17 (ii) If the failure by the new motor vehicle dealer, as provided in paragraph (i) of this
18 subdivision, relates to the performance of the new motor vehicle dealer in sales or service, then
19 good cause shall be defined as the failure of the new motor vehicle dealer to comply with reasonable
20 performance criteria established by the manufacturer, distributor or factory branch if the new motor
21 vehicle dealer was apprised by the manufacturer, distributor or factory branch, in writing, of that
22 failure; and:
23 (A) The notification stated that notice was provided of failure of performance pursuant to
24 paragraph (i) of this subdivision;
25 (B) The new motor vehicle dealer was afforded a reasonable opportunity, for a period of
26 not less than six (6) months, to comply with those criteria; and
27 (C) The new motor vehicle dealer did not demonstrate substantial progress towards
28 compliance with the manufacturer’s performance criteria during that period. ; and
29 (D) The performance criteria employed shall:
30 (I) Take into account the actual vehicle allocation offered to the dealer by the manufacturer,
31 distributor, or factory branch, as well as the dealer’s inventory levels relevant to achieve any
32 minimum performance standards to which the manufacturer, distributor, or factory branch holds
33 the dealer accountable; provided, however, the failure to provide allocation of any products or
34 vehicles, including by series, product line, or model, may not be considered a violation of this
LC001602 - Page 12 of 18

1 chapter if such failure is due to the dealer’s refusal or declination to accept product allocation
2 offered;
3 (II) Not be unfair, unreasonable, arbitrary or inequitable; and
4 (III) Consider the relevant and material local and state or regional criteria, including
5 prevailing economic conditions affecting the sales or service performance of a vehicle dealer.
6 (3) The manufacturer, distributor or factory branch shall have the burden of proof for
7 showing that the notice requirements have been complied with; that there was good cause for the
8 franchise termination; cancellation or nonrenewal; and that the manufacturer, distributor or factory
9 branch has acted in good faith.
10 (i) Notwithstanding the terms, provisions, or conditions of any franchise, prior to the
11 termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal of any franchise, the manufacturer, distributor or factory
12 branch shall furnish notification of the termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal to the new motor
13 vehicle dealer as follows:
14 (A) In the manner described in paragraph (ii) of this subdivision; and
15 (B) Not fewer than ninety (90) days prior to the effective date of the termination,
16 cancellation, or nonrenewal; or
17 (C) Not fewer than fifteen (15) days prior to the effective date of the termination,

19 (I) Insolvency of the new motor vehicle dealer, or the filing of any petition by, or against,
20 the new motor vehicle dealer under any bankruptcy or receivership law;
21 (II) Failure of the new motor vehicle dealer to conduct his customary sales and service
22 operations during his or her customary business hours for seven (7) consecutive business days;
23 (III) Final conviction of the new motor vehicle dealer, or any owner or operator of the
24 dealership, of a crime which is associated with or related to, the operation of the dealership;
25 (IV) Revocation of any license that the new motor vehicle dealer is required to have to
26 operate a dealership; or
27 (D) Not fewer than one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the effective date of the
28 termination or cancellation where the manufacturer, or distributor or factory branch is discontinuing
29 the sale of the product line.
30 (ii) Notification under this subsection shall be in writing, shall be by certified mail or
31 personally delivered to the new motor vehicle dealer, and shall contain:
32 (A) A statement of intention to terminate, cancel, or not to renew the franchise;
33 (B) A statement of the reasons for the termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal; and

3 notwithstanding the terms of any franchise whether entered into before or after the enactment of
4 this chapter or any of its provisions, the new motor vehicle dealer shall be allowed fair and
5 reasonable compensation by the manufacturer, distributor or factory branch for the following:
6 (A) The new motor vehicle dealer’s cost, less allowances paid by the manufacturer,
7 distributor or factory branch of each new, undamaged, unsold, and unaltered, except for dealer-
8 installed, manufacturer-, distributor- or factory branch-authorized accessories, motor vehicle,
9 regardless of model year purchased from the manufacturer, distributor or factory branch or another
10 dealer of the same line or make in the ordinary course of business within twenty-four (24) months
11 of termination, having five hundred (500) or fewer miles recorded on the odometer that is in the
12 new motor vehicle dealer’s inventory at the time of termination, nonrenewal, or cancellation.
13 (B) The new motor vehicle dealer’s cost of each new, unused, undamaged, and unsold part
14 or accessory that is in the current parts catalogue, or is identical to a part or accessory in the current
15 parts catalogue except for the number assigned to the part or accessory due to a change in the
16 number after the purchase of the part or accessory, and that is still in the original, resalable
17 merchandising package and in an unbroken lot, except that, in the case of sheet metal, a comparable
18 substitute for the original package may be used.
19 (C) The fair market value of each undamaged sign, normal wear and tear excepted, owned
20 by the dealer that bears a trademark or trade name used or claimed by the manufacturer, distributor
21 or factory branch that was purchased as a requirement of the manufacturer, distributor or factory
22 branch.
23 (D) The fair market value of all special tools, and automotive services equipment owned

LC001602 - Page 14 of 18

1 factory branch. If the inventory or other items are subject to a security interest, the manufacturer,
2 distributor or factory branch, wholesaler, or franchisor may make payment jointly to the dealer and
3 the holder of the security interest. In no event shall the payments be made later than ninety (90)
4 days of the effective date of the termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal.
5 (iv) In the event the termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal is involuntary and not
6 pursuant to subsection (3)(i)(C) of this section and:
7 (A) The new motor vehicle dealer is leasing the dealership facilities from a lessor other
8 than the manufacturer, distributor or factory branch, the manufacturer, distributor or factory branch
9 shall pay the new motor vehicle dealer a sum equivalent to the rent for the unexpired term of the
10 lease or (2) two year’s rent, whichever is less; or
11 (B) If the new motor vehicle dealer owns the facilities, the manufacturer, distributor or
12 factory branch shall pay the new motor vehicle dealer a sum equivalent to the reasonable rental
13 value of the facilities for two (2) years; if:
14 (I) The new motor vehicle dealer is unable to reasonably utilize the facilities for another
15 purpose;
16 (II) The new motor vehicle dealer, or the manufacturer, distributor or factory branch acting
17 as its agent, is unable to make arrangements for the cancellation or assumption of its lease
18 obligations by another party in the case of leased facilities, or is unable to sell dealer-owned
19 facilities; and
20 (III) Only to the extent those facilities were required as a condition of the franchise and
21 used to conduct sales and service operations related to the franchise product.
22 (v) In addition to any injunctive relief and any other damages allowable by this chapter, if
23 the manufacturer, distributor or factory branch is discontinuing the product line or fails to prove
24 that there was good cause for the termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal, or if the manufacturer,
25 distributor or factory branch fails to prove that the manufacturer, distributor or factory branch acted
26 in good faith, then the manufacturer, distributor or factory branch shall pay the new motor vehicle
27 dealer fair and reasonable compensation for the value of the dealership as an ongoing business.
28 In addition to the other compensation described in paragraphs (iii) and (iv) above and in
29 this section, the manufacturer, distributor or factory branch shall also reimburse the dealer for any
30 costs incurred for facility upgrades or alterations required by the manufacturer, distributor or
31 factory branch within two (2) years of the effective date of the termination.
32 (vi) If a manufacturer, distributor or factory branch is discontinuing the product line and

LC001602 - Page 15 of 18

1 (A) Authorize the dealer, at the dealer’s option, that remains a franchised dealer of the
2 manufacturer, distributor or factory branch regardless of the discontinuation of a product line, to
3 continue servicing and supplying parts (without prejudice to the right of the manufacturer,
4 distributor or factory branch to also authorize other franchised dealers to provide service and parts
5 for a discontinued product line), including services and parts pursuant to a warranty issued by the
6 manufacturer, distributor or factory branch for any goods or services marketed by the dealer
7 pursuant to the motor vehicle franchise for a period of not less than five (5) years from the effective
8 date of the termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal;
9 (B) Continue to reimburse the dealer that remains a franchised dealer of the manufacturer,
10 distributor or factory branch regardless of the discontinuation of a product line or another
11 franchised dealer of the manufacturer, distributor or factory branch in the area for warranty parts
12 and service in an amount, and on terms not less favorable than, those in effect prior to the
13 termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal;
14 (C) The manufacturer, distributor or factory branch shall continue to supply the dealer that
15 remains a franchised dealer of the manufacturer, distributor or factory branch regardless of the
16 discontinuation of a product line or another franchised dealer of the manufacturer, distributor or
17 factory branch in the area with replacement parts for any goods or services marketed by the dealer
18 pursuant to the franchise agreement for a period of not less than five (5) years from the effective
19 date of the termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal, at a price, and on terms not less favorable than,
20 those in effect prior to the termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal;
21 (vii) The requirements of this section do not apply to a termination, cancellation, or
22 nonrenewal due to the sale of the assets or stock of the motor vehicle dealer.
23 (D) To be entitled to facilities assistance from the manufacturer, distributor or factory
24 branch as described above, the dealer shall have the obligation to mitigate damages by listing the
25 dealership facilities for lease or sublease with a licensed real estate agent within thirty (30) days
26 after the effective date of the termination of the franchise and thereafter be reasonably cooperating
27 with such real estate agent in the performance of the agent’s duties and responsibilities. If the dealer
28 is able to lease or sublease the dealership facilities on terms that are consistent with local zoning
29 requirements to preserve the right to sell motor vehicles from the dealership facilities and the terms
30 of the dealer’s lease, the dealer shall be obligated to pay the manufacturer, distributor or factory
31 branch the net revenue received from such mitigation, but only following receipt of facilities
32 assistance payments pursuant to this chapter, and only up to the total amount of facilities assistance
33 payments that the dealer has received.
34 (e) It shall be deemed a violation of this chapter for a motor vehicle dealer:
LC001602 - Page 16 of 18

1 (1) To require a purchaser of a new motor vehicle, as a condition of the sale and delivery
2 thereof, to also purchase special features, equipment, parts, or accessories not desired or requested
3 by the purchaser. This prohibition shall not apply as to special features, equipment, parts, or
4 accessories that are already installed on the car before sale by the dealer.
5 (2) To represent and sell as a new motor vehicle any motor vehicle that is a used motor
6 vehicle.
7 (3) To resort to or use any false or misleading advertisement in connection with his or her
8 business as a motor vehicle dealer.
