9 employees’ retirement system of Rhode Island, the judicial retirement benefits trust, and the state
10 police retirement benefits trust, calculated by the system’s actuary on an aggregate basis, exceeds
11 eighty percent (80%) in which event the benefit adjustment will be reinstated for all members for

2 below, for all present and former members, active and retired members, and beneficiaries receiving

16 of retirement or the date on which the retiree reaches age fifty-five (55), whichever is later. In the
17 event the retirement board adjusts the actuarially assumed rate of return for the system, either
18 upward or downward, the subtrahend shall be adjusted either upward or downward in the same
19 amount.
20 (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (4)(7)(iii), the benefit adjustments under this section
21 for any plan year shall be suspended in their entirety unless the funded ratio of the employees’
22 retirement system of Rhode Island, the judicial retirement benefits trust, and the state police

24 percent (80%) in which event the benefit adjustment will be reinstated for all members for such
25 plan year.
26 In determining whether a funding level under this paragraph (4)(7)(ii) has been achieved,
27 the actuary shall calculate the funding percentage after taking into account the reinstatement of any
28 current or future benefit adjustment provided under this section.
29 (iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (4)(7)(ii), in each fifth plan year commencing after June
30 30, 2012, commencing with the plan year ending June 30, 2017, and subsequently at intervals of
31 five (5) plan years, a benefit adjustment shall be calculated and made in accordance with paragraph

LC002002 - Page 6 of 11

1 (iv) The provisions of this paragraph (j)(4)(7) shall become effective July 1, 2012, and shall
2 apply to any benefit adjustment not granted on or prior to June 30, 2012.

6 (5)(8) This subsection (5)(8) shall become effective for the period July 1, 2015 through
7 June 30, 2025.
8 (i)(A) As soon as administratively reasonable following the enactment into law of this
9 paragraph (5)(8)(i)(A), a one-time benefit adjustment shall be provided to members and/or
10 beneficiaries of members who retired on or before June 30, 2012, in the amount of two percent
11 (2%) of the lesser of either the member’s retirement allowance or the first twenty-five thousand
12 dollars ($25,000) of the member’s retirement allowance. This one-time benefit adjustment shall be
13 provided without regard to the retiree’s age or number of years since retirement.
14 (B) Notwithstanding the prior subsections of this section, for all present and former
15 members, active and retired members, and beneficiaries receiving any retirement, disability or
16 death allowance or benefit of any kind, the annual benefit adjustment provided in any calendar year
17 under this section for adjustments on and after January 1, 2016, and subject to subsection (5)(8)(ii)
18 below, shall be equal to (I) multiplied by (II):
19 (I) shall equal the sum of fifty percent (50%) of (1) plus fifty percent (50%) of (2) where:
20 (1) is equal to the percentage determined by subtracting five and one-half percent (5.5%)
21 (the “subtrahend”) from the five-year average investment return of the retirement system
22 determined as of the last day of the plan year preceding the calendar year in which the adjustment
23 is granted, said percentage not to exceed four percent (4%) and not to be less than zero percent
24 (0%). The “five-year average investment return” shall mean the average of the investment returns
25 of the most recent five (5) plan years as determined by the retirement board. In the event the
26 retirement board adjusts the actuarially assumed rate of return for the system, either upward or
27 downward, the subtrahend shall be adjusted either upward or downward in the same amount.
28 (2) is equal to the lesser of three percent (3%) or the percentage increase in the Consumer
29 Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) as published by the U.S. Department of Labor
30 Statistics determined as of September 30 of the prior calendar year.
31 In no event shall the sum of (1) plus (2) exceed three and one-half percent (3.5%) or be
32 less than zero percent (0%).
33 (II) is equal to the lesser of either the member’s retirement allowance or the first twenty-
34 five thousand eight hundred and fifty-five dollars ($25,855) of retirement allowance, such amount
LC002002 - Page 7 of 11

1 to be indexed annually in the same percentage as determined under subsection (5)(8)(i)(B)(I) above.
2 The benefit adjustments provided by this subsection (5)(8)(i)(B) shall be provided to all retirees
3 entitled to receive a benefit adjustment as of June 30, 2012, under the law then in effect, and for all
4 other retirees the benefit adjustments shall commence upon the third anniversary of the date of
5 retirement or the date on which the retiree reaches their Social Security retirement age, whichever
6 is later.
7 (ii) Except as provided in subsection (5)(8)(iii), the benefit adjustments under subsection
8 (5)(8)(i)(B) for any plan year shall be suspended in their entirety unless the funded ratio of the
9 employees’ retirement system of Rhode Island, the judicial retirement benefits trust, and the state
10 police retirement benefits trust, calculated by the system’s actuary on an aggregate basis, exceeds
11 eighty percent (80%) in which event the benefit adjustment will be reinstated for all members for
12 such plan year. Effective July 1, 2024, the funded ratio of the employees’ retirement system of
13 Rhode Island, the judicial retirement benefits trust, and the state police retirement benefits trust,
14 calculated by the system’s actuary on an aggregate basis, of exceeding eighty percent (80%) for the
15 benefit adjustment to be reinstated for all members for such plan year shall be replaced with
16 seventy-five percent (75%).
17 In determining whether a funding level under this subsection (5)(8)(ii) has been achieved,
18 the actuary shall calculate the funding percentage after taking into account the reinstatement of any
19 current or future benefit adjustment provided under this section.
20 (iii) Notwithstanding subsection (5)(8)(ii), in each fourth plan year commencing after June
21 30, 2012, commencing with the plan year ending June 30, 2016, and subsequently at intervals of
22 four plan years: (i) A benefit adjustment shall be calculated and made in accordance with paragraph
23 (5)(8)(i)(B) above; and (ii) Effective for members and/or beneficiaries of members who retired on
24 or before June 30, 2015, the dollar amount in subsection (5)(7)(i)(B)(II) of twenty-five thousand
25 eight hundred and fifty-five dollars ($25,855) shall be replaced with thirty-one thousand and
26 twenty-six dollars ($31,026) until the funded ratio of the employees’ retirement system of Rhode
27 Island, the judicial retirement benefits trust, and the state police retirement benefits trust, calculated
28 by the system’s actuary on an aggregate basis, exceeds eighty percent (80%). Effective July 1,
29 2024, the funded ratio of the employees’ retirement system of Rhode Island, the judicial retirement
30 benefits trust, and the state police retirement benefits trust, calculated by the system’s actuary on
31 an aggregate basis, of exceeding eighty percent (80%) shall be replaced with seventy-five percent
32 (75%).
33 (iv) Effective for members and/or beneficiaries of members who have retired on or before
34 July 1, 2015, a one-time stipend of five hundred dollars ($500) shall be payable within sixty (60)
LC002002 - Page 8 of 11

1 days following the enactment of the legislation implementing this provision, and a second one-time
2 stipend of five hundred dollars ($500) in the same month of the following year. These stipends
3 shall be payable to all retired members or beneficiaries receiving a benefit as of the applicable
4 payment date and shall not be considered cost of living adjustments under the prior provisions of
5 this section.
6 (9) This subsection (9) shall become effective July 1, 2025.
7 (i) Notwithstanding the prior paragraphs of this section, for all present and former
8 members, active and retired members, and beneficiaries receiving any retirement, disability or
9 death allowance or benefit of any kind, whether for or on behalf of a non-contributory member or
10 contributory member, the annual benefit adjustment provided in each calendar year shall be equal
11 to one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500). In each succeeding year, during the month of
12 January, the retirement allowance shall be increased by one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500),
13 to be continued during the lifetime of the member.
14 (6)(10) Any member with contributory service on or after July 1, 2012, who has completed
15 at least five (5) years of contributory service but who has not retired in accordance with (j)(1) above,
16 shall be eligible to retire upon the attainment of member’s Social Security retirement age as defined
17 in § 36-8-1(20).
18 (7)(11) In no event shall a member’s retirement allowance be less than the member’s
19 retirement allowance calculated as of June 30, 2012, based on the member’s years of total service
20 and whole salary as of June 30, 2012.
21 (k) In calculating the retirement benefit for any member, the term base salary as used in
22 subdivision (b)(3) and or average compensation as used in paragraph (j) shall not be affected by a
23 deferral of salary plan or a reduced salary plan implemented to avoid shutdowns or layoffs or to
24 effect cost savings. Basic salary shall remain for retirement calculation that which it would have
25 been but for the salary deferral or salary reduction due to a plan implemented to avoid shutdowns
26 or layoffs or to effect cost savings.
