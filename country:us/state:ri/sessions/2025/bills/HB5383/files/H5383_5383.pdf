RELATING TO ELECTIONS --PRIMARY ELECTION DATES
***
1 This act would require that the primary election date, typically the eighth Tuesday
2 preceding the biennial state elections, shall be held on the Wednesday following Labor Day, only
3 if the eighth Tuesday immediately follows Labor Day. Additionally, this act would no longer
4 mandate, but rather allow local boards to annually conduct a voter registration drive at each high
5 school within the city or town.
6 This act would take effect upon passage.
