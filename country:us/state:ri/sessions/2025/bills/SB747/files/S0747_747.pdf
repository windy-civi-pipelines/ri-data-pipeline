16 pursuant to a reduction in force or reorganization, if there is a teacher without tenure for whose
17 position the covered employee is currently certified or if there is a less qualified teacher with tenure
18 holding the same or similar position for which the covered employee is currently certified. No
19 teacher with tenure shall be displaced in accordance with the terms of a collective bargaining

1 agreement or otherwise by a more senior teacher with tenure unless the more senior teacher is
2 currently certified and is at least as qualified for the position as the junior teacher holding the
3 position.
4 (ii) The criteria for determining a qualified teacher under this subsection shall be subject
5 to the collective bargaining agreement; provided, however, that any such collectively bargained for
6 qualifications shall include, as the primary factors, indicators of job performance, including overall
7 ratings resulting from comprehensive evaluations and the best interests of the students in the school
8 or district.
9 (iii) A teacher meeting one of the following criteria and who has not received an
10 unsatisfactory performance evaluation in the school year immediately prior to the school year in
11 which a layoff is announced shall be exempted without regard to tenure:
12 (A) A teacher who graduated from an in-district secondary school if the district has higher
13 than the state percentage of high-needs students, as defined by the department;

17 with the lowest staff retention in the district;
18 (D) A teacher deemed by the department as a teacher of the year;
19 (E) A teacher who received the highest rating on a performance evaluation delivered in
20 either or both of the school years immediately prior to the school year in which a layoff is
21 announced; or
22 (F) A teacher with linguistic proficiency in relation to an in-district language or dialect.
23 For purposes of this subsection, linguistic proficiency means:

1 a teacher is assigned or, if the teacher is not assigned to a school, of the homes of the students
2 enrolled in the district.
3 (iv) Among the remaining teachers without tenure, no teacher shall be laid off pursuant to
4 a reduction in force or reorganization if there is a less qualified teacher without such status holding
5 the same or similar position for which the covered employee is currently certified.
6 (v) The school committee and the collective bargaining representative may negotiate for
7 seniority or length of service only as a tie-breaker in personnel actions under this subsection among
8 teachers whose qualifications are no different using the qualifications collectively bargained for in
9 accordance with this subsection.

11 governing body of schools on or before June 1 notifying the teacher that his or her employment for
