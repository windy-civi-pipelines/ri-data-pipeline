15 section.
16 (b) A pest control agent who is inspecting a dwelling unit for bed bugs may conduct an
17 initial visual and manual inspection of a tenant's bedding and upholstered furniture. The pest control
18 agent may inspect items other than bedding and upholstered furniture when the pest control agent
19 determines that such an inspection is necessary and reasonable.
20 (c) If a pest control agent finds bed bugs in a dwelling unit or in any contiguous dwelling

31 to contain bed bugs, the qualified inspector shall advise the tenant that the furniture, clothing,
32 equipment, or personal property should not be removed from the dwelling unit until a pest control
33 agent determines that a bed bug treatment has been completed; except that, if the determination that
34 any furniture, clothing, equipment, or personal property contains bed bugs is made by a pest control
LC000801 - Page 3 of 7

1 agent then the qualified inspector shall advise the tenant regarding the removal of the furniture,
2 clothing, equipment, or personal property. The tenant shall not dispose of personal property that
3 was determined to contain bed bugs in any common area where such disposal may risk the
4 infestation of other dwelling units.
5 (f)(1) Nothing in this section requires a landlord to provide a tenant with alternative lodging
6 or to pay to replace a tenant's personal property.
7 (2) Nothing in this section preempts or restricts the application of any state or federal law
8 concerning reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities.
9 23-104-6. Bed bugs -- Renting of dwelling units with bed bugs prohibited.
10 A landlord shall not offer for rent a dwelling unit that the landlord knows or reasonably
11 suspects to contain bed bugs. Upon request from a prospective tenant, a landlord shall disclose to
12 the prospective tenant whether, to the landlord's knowledge, the dwelling unit that the landlord is
13 offering for rent contained bed bugs within the previous eight (8) months. Upon request from a
14 tenant or a prospective tenant, a landlord shall disclose the last date, if any, on which a dwelling
15 unit being rented or offered for rent was inspected for, and found to be free of, bed bugs.

18 actual damages.

20 against a tenant who:
21 (1) Refuses to provide reasonable access to a dwelling unit; or
22 (2) Fails to comply with a reasonable request for inspection or treatment of a dwelling unit.
23 (c) If a court finds that a tenant has unreasonably failed to comply with one or more
24 requirements set forth in this chapter, the court may issue an order to carry out the provisions of
25 this chapter including:
26 (1) Granting the landlord access to the dwelling unit for the purposes set forth in this
27 chapter;
28 (2) Granting the landlord the right to engage in bed bug inspection and treatment measures

28 proof, insect proof, and watertight.
29 (f) Every owner or operator of a dwelling containing four (4) or more dwelling units shall
