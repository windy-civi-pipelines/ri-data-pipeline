4 Projects Fund. Notwithstanding any provision of general law, any unexpended and unencumbered
5 federal funds from the state fiscal recovery fund and capital projects fund shall be reappropriated
6 in the ensuing fiscal year and made available for the same purposes. However, any such

16 at risk can be remedied. In the event that any state fiscal recovery fund program underspends its
17 appropriation or receives program income as defined by U.S. Treasury and would put the state at

25 dollars ($1,000,000) or greater than twenty percent (20%) of its total appropriation, the governor’s
26 proposed reclassification shall go into effect thirty (30) days after its referral to the general

30 loan authority shall transfer to the state controller by June 30, 2026, the sum of two million nine
31 hundred thousand dollars ($2,900,000).

33 transfer the sum of four million dollars ($4,000,000) to the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Fund
34 by June 30, 2026.

2 transfer the sum of two million five hundred thousand dollars ($2,500,000) to the housing resources
3 and homelessness restricted receipt account by June 30, 2026.
4 SECTION 23. The general assembly makes the following findings:
5 (1) Federal disbursements play a significant role in the financial management of Rhode
6 Island’s overall budget and revenues;
7 (2) With pending federal legislative proposals, uncertainty exists regarding projected future
8 federal disbursements to Rhode Island;
9 (3) Potential federal tax actions, actions related to Medicare/Medicaid programs, and
10 actions related to grants could all pose significant state budget challenges in fiscal year 2026 and
11 thereafter;
12 (4) In order to be prepared to address these potential challenges, it is in the best interest of
13 the State to convene advisory working groups to inform any budget changes that may be
14 necessitated by federal actions; and
15 (5) It is further in the best interest of the State for the Office of Management and Budget,
16 in coordination with other state agencies, to develop options for consideration by the general
17 assembly;
18 Therefore, the general assembly respectfully requests the administration to convene an
19 advisory group, as set forth in Article 5, § 3, to assist in the review and analysis of federal tax
20 actions; to appoint an advisory group, as set forth in Article 8, § 8, to assist in the review and
21 analysis of federal actions related to Medicare/Medicaid; and to monitor the status of federal grants
22 and develop options for the general assembly to address federal funding changes, as set forth in
23 Article 3, § 7.
24 SECTION 24. This article shall take effect as of July 1, 2025, except as otherwise provided
25 herein.

3 SECTION 1. Chapter 16-57 of the General Laws entitled "Rhode Island Higher Education

5 amended by adding thereto the following sections:

15 (c) All contracts and agreements of whatsoever kind of the division of higher education
16 assistance are hereby assigned, transferred to, and assumed by the office of postsecondary
17 commissioner.
18 (d) Whenever in any general law, public law or rule or regulation reference is made to "the
19 division of higher education assistance", the reference shall be deemed to refer to and mean "the
20 office of postsecondary commissioner", which also may be referred to as the "office".
21 16-57-4.2. Tuition savings program fund.
22 There is hereby established a restricted receipt account in the general fund and housed in
23 the office of postsecondary commissioner to be known as the "tuition savings program fund". The
24 purpose of the fund is to receive and disburse scholarship funds pursuant to the provisions of this
25 chapter.
26 SECTION 2. Sections 16-57-2, 16-57-3, 16-57-4, 16-57-6.1, 16-57-7, 16-57-8, 16-57-9,
27 16-57-10 and 16-57-12 of the General Laws in Chapter 16-57 entitled "Rhode Island Higher
28 Education Assistance Act [See Title 16 Chapter 97 — The Rhode Island Board of Education Act]"
29 are hereby amended to read as follows:
30 16-57-2. Findings.

1 The purpose of this chapter is to authorize a system of financial assistance, consisting of
2 loan guaranties, savings programs, and other aids, for qualified students, parents, and others
3 responsible for paying the costs of education to enable them to obtain an education beyond the high
4 school level by attending public or private educational institutions. The general assembly has found
5 and declares that it is in the public interest and essential to the welfare and well being of the
6 inhabitants of the state and to the proper growth and development of the state to foster and provide
7 financial assistance to qualified students, parents, and others responsible for paying the costs of
8 education in order to help prospective students to obtain an education beyond the high school level.
9 The general assembly has found that many inhabitants of the state who are fully qualified to enroll
10 in appropriate educational institutions for furthering their education beyond the high school level
11 lack the financial means and are unable, without financial assistance as authorized under this
12 chapter, to pay the cost of their education, with a consequent irreparable loss to the state of valuable
13 talents vital to its welfare. The general assembly also recognizes that educational institutions for
14 higher education are in need of appropriate additional means to provide financial assistance to
15 qualified students, parents, and others responsible for paying the costs of education. The general
16 assembly has determined that the establishment of a proper system of financial assistance,
17 containing eligibility opportunities for students and residents of this state and other states serves a
18 public purpose and is fully consistent with the long established policy of the state to encourage,
19 promote, and assist the education of the people of the state. The general assembly further finds that
20 higher education financial assistance needs of Rhode Islanders will be better served by transferring
21 all of the functions and programs of the former Rhode Island higher education assistance authority
22 to and of the Rhode Island division of higher education assistance to the office of postsecondary
23 commissioner and the office of the general treasurer.

26 28-30-18. Additional benefits payable to retired judges and their surviving spouses or
27 domestic partners.
28 (a) All judges of the workers’ compensation court, or their surviving spouses or domestic
29 partners, who retire after January 1, 1970, and who receive a retirement allowance pursuant to the
30 provisions of this title, shall, on the first day of January next following the third anniversary date
31 of their retirement, receive a cost-of-living retirement adjustment in addition to his or her retirement
32 allowance in an amount equal to three percent (3%) of the original retirement allowance. In each
33 succeeding subsequent year during the month of January the retirement allowance shall be
34 increased an additional three percent (3%) of the original allowance, compounded annually from
Art3
RELATING TO GOVERNMENT REFORM AND REORGANIZATION
(Page -16-)

1 the year the cost-of-living adjustment was first payable to be continued during the lifetime of that
2 judge or his or her surviving spouse or domestic partner. For the purpose of that computation, credit
3 shall be given for a full calendar year regardless of the effective date of the retirement allowance.
4 (b) Any judge who retired prior to January 31, 1980, shall be deemed for the purpose of
5 this section to have retired on January 1, 1980.
6 (c) For judges not eligible to retire as of September 30, 2009, and not eligible upon passage
7 of this article, and for their beneficiaries, the cost-of-living adjustment described in subsection (a)
8 above shall only apply to the first thirty-five thousand dollars ($35,000) of retirement allowance,
9 indexed annually, and shall commence upon the third (3rd) anniversary of the date of retirement or

11 ($35,000) limit shall increase annually by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for
12 all Urban Consumers (CPI-U) as published by the United States Department of Labor Statistics
13 determined as of September 30 of the prior calendar year or three percent (3%), whichever is less.
14 The first thirty-five thousand dollars ($35,000), as indexed, of retirement allowance shall be
15 multiplied by the percentage of increase in the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers
16 (CPI-U) as published by the United States Department of Labor Statistics determined as of
17 September 30 of the prior calendar year or three percent (3%), whichever is less on the month
18 following the anniversary date of each succeeding year. For judges eligible to retire as of September
19 30, 2009, or eligible upon passage of this article, and for their beneficiaries, the provisions of this
20 subsection (c) shall not apply.

25 behalf of justices engaged on or prior to December 31, 1989, as a noncontributory justice or
26 engaged after December 31, 1989, as a contributory justice, the annual benefit adjustment provided
27 in any calendar year under this section shall be equal to (A) multiplied by (B) where (A) is equal
28 to the percentage determined by subtracting five and one-half percent (5.5%) (the “subtrahend”)
29 from the five-year average investment return of the retirement system determined as of the last day
30 of the plan year preceding the calendar year in which the adjustment is granted, said percentage not
31 to exceed four percent (4%) and not to be less than zero percent (0%), and (B) is equal to the lesser
32 of the justice’s retirement allowance or the first twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) of
33 retirement allowance, such twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) amount to be indexed annually
34 in the same percentage as determined under (d)(1)(A) above. The “five-year average investment

7 downward in the same amount.
8 (2) Except as provided in subsection (d)(3), the benefit adjustments under this section for
9 any plan year shall be suspended in their entirely unless the funded ratio of the employees’
10 retirement system of Rhode Island, the judicial retirement benefits trust, and the state police
11 retirement benefits trust, calculated by the system’s actuary on an aggregate basis, exceeds eighty
12 percent (80%) in which event the benefit adjustment will be reinstated for all justices for such plan
13 year.
14 In determining whether a funding level under this subsection (d)(2) has been achieved, the
15 actuary shall calculate the funding percentage after taking into account the reinstatement of any
16 current or future benefit adjustment provided under this section.
17 (3) Notwithstanding subsection (d)(2), in each fifth plan year commencing after June 30,
18 2012, commencing with the plan year ending June 30, 2017, and subsequently at intervals of five

21 retirement benefits trust, and the state police retirement benefits trust, calculated by the system’s
22 actuary on an aggregate basis, exceeds eighty percent (80%).
23 (4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the provisions of this subsection

29 of justices who retired on or before June 30, 2012, in the amount of two percent (2%) of the lesser
30 of either the justice’s retirement allowance or the first twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) of
31 the justice’s retirement allowance. This one-time benefit adjustment shall be provided without
32 regard to the retiree’s age or number of years since retirement.
33 (ii) Notwithstanding the prior subsections of this section, for all present and former justices,
34 active and retired justices, and beneficiaries receiving any retirement, disability or death allowance

8 (the “subtrahend”) from the five-year average investment return of the retirement system
9 determined as of the last day of the plan year preceding the calendar year in which the adjustment
10 is granted, said percentage not to exceed four percent (4%) and not to be less than zero percent
11 (0%). The “five-year average investment return” shall mean the average of the investment returns
12 of the most recent five (5) plan years as determined by the retirement board. In the event the
13 retirement board adjusts the actuarially assumed rate of return for the system, either upward or
14 downward, the subtrahend shall be adjusted either upward or downward in the same amount.
15 (II) Is equal to the lesser of three percent (3%) or the percentage increase in the Consumer
16 Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U) as published by the United States Department of
17 Labor Statistics determined as of September 30 of the prior calendar year. In no event shall the sum
18 of (I) plus (II) exceed three and one-half percent (3.5%) or be less than zero percent (0%).
19 (B) Is equal to the lesser of either the justice’s retirement allowance or the first twenty-five
20 thousand eight hundred and fifty-five dollars ($25,855) of retirement allowance, such amount to be

22 The benefit adjustments provided by this subsection (e)(1)(ii) shall be provided to all
23 retirees entitled to receive a benefit adjustment as of June 30, 2012, under the law then in effect,
24 and for all other retirees the benefit adjustments shall commence upon the third anniversary of the

29 employees’ retirement system of Rhode Island, the judicial retirement benefits trust, and the state
30 police retirement benefits trust, calculated by the system’s actuary on an aggregate basis, exceeds
31 eighty percent (80%) in which event the benefit adjustment will be reinstated for all justices for
32 such plan year. Effective July 1, 2024, the funded ratio of the employees’ retirement system of
33 Rhode Island, the judicial retirement benefits trust, and the state police retirement benefits trust,
34 calculated by the system’s actuary on an aggregate basis, of exceeding eighty percent (80%) for the

15 funded ratio of the employees’ retirement system of Rhode Island, the judicial retirement benefits
16 trust, and the state police retirement benefits trust, calculated by the system’s actuary on an
17 aggregate basis, of exceeding eighty percent (80%) shall be replaced with seventy-five percent
18 (75%).

3 WHEREAS, The Army Corps of Engineers expects to begin maintenance of the
4 Providence River and Harbor Shipping Channel in the fall of 2027, the total cost share of the non-
5 federal sponsor is required by August 2026; and
6 WHEREAS, The state share associated with this project is estimated to be thirty five
7 million dollars ($35.0 million), with six hundred and twenty thousand dollars ($620,000) derived
8 from the Coastal Resources Management Council Dredge Fund, financing from the issuance of
9 debt as described herein, and the remainder from other sources of capital funds. The total financing
10 obligation of the State of Rhode Island would be approximately twenty-three million dollars ($23.0

16 eleven million and six hundred thousand dollars ($11.6 million) of the total principal and interest
17 payments is expected to be financed from an increase in fees charged to marine operators to deposit
18 their dredged materials into CAD cells, with general revenue appropriations used to supplement
19 fee revenues. General revenue appropriations shall finance principal and interest payments in any
20 fiscal year that fee revenues are insufficient; and
21 RESOLVED, That this General Assembly hereby approves financing in an amount not to
22 exceed twenty-three million dollars ($23.0 million) for the provision of funds for the Confined
23 Aquatic Disposal Cells project, including two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) to pay costs of
24 financing; and be it further

30 year of its estimated completion date. If the motion picture production company does not expect to
31 complete its production within the same calendar year of its estimated completion date, it shall

Art5
RELATING TO TAXES AND FEES
(Page -32-)

1 activities, the applicant shall request a certificate of good standing from the Rhode Island division
2 of taxation. The certificates shall verify to the film office the motion picture production company’s
3 compliance with the requirements of § 44-31.2-2(11). The applicant shall properly prepare, sign,
4 and submit to the film office an application for final certification of the production and which must
5 include the certificate of good standing from the division of taxation. In addition, the application
6 shall contain such information and data as the film office determines is necessary for the proper
7 evaluation and administration, including, but not limited to, any information about the motion
8 picture production company, its investors, and information about the production previously granted
9 initial certification. The final application shall also contain a cost report and an “accountant’s
10 certification.” The film office and tax administrator may rely without independent investigation,
11 upon the accountant’s certification, in the form of an opinion, confirming the accuracy of the
12 information included in the cost report. Upon review of a duly completed and filed application, the
13 film office will make a determination pertaining to the final certification of the production. Within
14 ninety (90) days after the division of taxation’s receipt of the motion picture production company
15 final certification and cost report, the division of taxation shall issue a certification of the amount
16 of credit for which the motion picture production company qualifies under § 44-31.2-5. To claim
17 the tax credit, the division of taxation’s certification as to the amount of the tax credit shall be
18 attached to all state tax returns on which the credit is claimed.
19 (c) Final certification and credits. Upon determination that the motion picture production
20 company qualifies for final certification, the film office shall issue a letter to the production
21 company indicating “certificate of completion of a state-certified production.” A motion picture
22 production company is prohibited from using state funds, state loans, or state guaranteed loans to
23 qualify for the motion picture tax credit. All documents that are issued by the film office pursuant
24 to this section shall reference the identification number that was issued to the production as part of
25 its initial certification.
26 (d) The director of the Rhode Island council on the arts, in consultation as needed with the
27 tax administrator, shall promulgate such rules and regulations as are necessary to carry out the
28 intent and purposes of this chapter in accordance with the general guidelines provided herein for
29 the certification of the production and the resultant production credit.
30 (e) The tax administrator of the division of taxation, in consultation with the director of the
31 Rhode Island film and television office, shall promulgate the rules and regulations as are necessary
32 to carry out the intent and purposes of this chapter in accordance with the general guidelines for
33 the tax credit provided herein.
34 (f) Any motion picture production company applying for the credit shall be required to

2 SECTION 13. Sections 44-32-1, 44-32-2 and 44-32-3 of the General Laws in Chapter 44-
3 32 entitled "Elective Deduction for Research and Development Facilities" are hereby amended to
4 read as follows:
5 44-32-1. Elective deduction against allocated entire net income.
6 (a) General. Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, at the election of a taxpayer
7 who is subject to the income tax imposed by chapters 11 or 30 of this title, there shall be deducted
8 from the portion of its entire net income allocated within the state the items prescribed in subsection
9 (b) of this section, in lieu of depreciation or investment tax credit.
10 (b) One-year write-off of new research and development facilities.
11 (1) Expenditures paid or incurred during the taxable year for the construction,
12 reconstruction, erection or acquisition of any new, not used, property as described in subsection (c)
13 of this section, which is used or to be used for purposes of research and development in the
14 experimental or laboratory sense. The purposes are not deemed to include the ordinary testing or
15 inspection of materials or products for quality control, efficiency surveys, management studies,
16 consumer surveys, advertising, promotion, or research in connection with literary, historical, or
17 similar projects. The deduction shall be allowed only on condition that the entire net income for
18 the taxable year and all succeeding taxable years is computed without the deduction of any
19 expenditures and without any deduction for depreciation of the property, except to the extent that
20 its basis may be attributable to factors other than the expenditures, (expenditures and depreciation
21 deducted for federal income tax purposes shall be added to the entire net income allocated to Rhode
22 Island), or in case a deduction is allowable pursuant to this subdivision for only a part of the
23 expenditures, on condition that any deduction allowed for federal income tax purposes on account
24 of the expenditures or on account of depreciation of the property is proportionately reduced in
25 computing the entire net income for the taxable year and all succeeding taxable years. Concerning
26 property that is used or to be used for research and development only in part, or during only part of
27 its useful life, a proportionate part of the expenditures shall be deductible. If all or part of the
28 expenditures concerning any property has been deducted as provided in this section, and the
29 property is used for purposes other than research and development to a greater extent than originally
30 reported, the taxpayer shall report the use in its report for the first taxable year during which it
31 occurs, and the tax administrator may recompute the tax for the year or years for which the
32 deduction was allowed, and may assess any additional tax resulting from the recomputation as a
33 current tax, within three (3) years of the reporting of the change to the tax administrator. Any
34 change in use of the property in whole or in part from that, which originally qualified the property
Art5
RELATING TO TAXES AND FEES
(Page -34-)

1 for the deduction, requires a recomputation. The tax administrator has the authority to promulgate
2 regulations to prevent the avoidance of tax liability.
3 (2) The deduction shall be allowed only where an election for amortization of air or water
4 pollution control facilities has not been exercised in respect to the same property.
5 (3) The tax as a result of recomputation of a prior year’s deduction is due as an additional
6 tax for the year the property ceases to qualify.
7 (c) Property covered by deductions. The deductions shall be allowed only with respect to
8 tangible property which is new, not used, is depreciable pursuant to 26 U.S.C. § 167, was acquired
9 by purchase as defined in 26 U.S.C. § 179(d), has a situs in this state, and is used in the taxpayer’s
10 trade or business. For the taxable years beginning on or after July 1, 1974, a taxpayer is not allowed
11 a deduction under this section with respect to tangible property leased by it to any other person or
12 corporation or leased from any other person or corporation. For purposes of the preceding sentence,
13 any contract or agreement to lease or rent or for a license to use the property is considered a lease,
14 unless the contract or agreement is treated for federal income tax purposes as an installment
15 purchase rather than a lease. With respect to property that the taxpayer uses itself for purposes other
16 than leasing for part of a taxable year and leases for a part of a taxable year, the taxpayer shall be
17 allowed a deduction under this section in proportion to the part of the year it uses the property.
18 (d) Entire net income. “Entire net income”, as used in this section, means net income
19 allocated to this state.
20 (e) Carry-over of excess deductions. If the deductions allowable for any taxable year
21 pursuant to this section exceed the portion of the taxpayer’s entire net income allocated to this state
22 for that year, the excess may be carried over to the following taxable year or years, not to exceed
23 three (3) years, and may be deducted from the portion of the taxpayer’s entire net income allocated
24 to this state for that year or years.
25 (f) Gain or loss on sale or disposition of property. In any taxable year when property is sold
26 or disposed of before the end of its useful life, with respect to which a deduction has been allowed
27 pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the gain or loss on this entering into the computation of
28 federal taxable income is disregarded in computing the entire net income, and there is added to or
29 subtracted from the portion of the entire net income allocated within the state the gain or loss upon
30 the sale or other disposition. In computing the gain or loss, the basis of the property sold or disposed
31 of is adjusted to reflect the deduction allowed with respect to the property pursuant to subsection
32 (b) of this section; provided, that no loss is recognized for the purpose of this subsection with
33 respect to a sale or other disposition of property to a person whose acquisition of this property is
34 not a purchase as defined in 26 U.S.C. § 179(d).
Art5

(Page -35-)

1 (g) Investment credit not allowed on research and development property. No investment
2 credit under chapter 31 of this title shall be allowed on the research and development property for
3 which accelerated write-off is adopted under this section.
4 (h) Consolidated returns. The research and development deduction shall only be allowed
5 against the entire net income of the corporation included in a consolidated return and shall not be
6 allowed against the entire net income of other corporations that may join in the filing of a
7 consolidated state tax return.
8 (i) Sunset. No deductions shall be allowed under this section for tax years beginning on or
9 after January 1, 2026. Deductions allowed for tax years ending on or before December 31, 2025,
10 may be carried forward into tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2026, in accordance with
11 subsection (e) of this section.
12 44-32-2. Credit for research and development property acquired, constructed, or
13 reconstructed or erected after July 1, 1994.
14 (a) A taxpayer shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed by chapters 11, 17, or 30
15 of this title. The amount of the credit shall be ten percent (10%) of the cost or other basis for federal
16 income tax purposes of tangible personal property, and other tangible property, including buildings
17 and structural components of buildings, described in subsection (b) of this section; acquired,
18 constructed or reconstructed, or erected after July 1, 1994.
19 (b) A credit shall be allowed under this section with respect to tangible personal property
20 and other tangible property, including buildings and structural components of buildings which are:
21 depreciable pursuant to 26 U.S.C. § 167 or recovery property with respect to which a deduction is
22 allowable under 26 U.S.C. § 168, have a useful life of three (3) years or more, are acquired by
23 purchase as defined in 26 U.S.C. § 179(d), have a situs in this state and are used principally for
24 purposes of research and development in the experimental or laboratory sense which shall also
25 include property used by property and casualty insurance companies for research and development
26 into methods and ways of preventing or reducing losses from fire and other perils. The credit shall
27 be allowable in the year the property is first placed in service by the taxpayer, which is the year in
28 which, under the taxpayer’s depreciation practice, the period for depreciation with respect to the
29 property begins, or the year in which the property is placed in a condition or state of readiness and
30 availability for a specifically assigned function, whichever is earlier. These purposes shall not be
31 deemed to include the ordinary testing or inspection of materials or products for quality control,
32 efficiency surveys, management studies, consumer surveys, advertising, promotions, or research in
33 connection with literary, historical or similar projects.
34 (c) A taxpayer shall not be allowed a credit under this section with respect to any property
Art5
RELATING TO TAXES AND FEES
(Page -36-)

1 described in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, if a deduction is taken for the property under §
2 44-32-1.
3 (d) A taxpayer shall not be allowed a credit under this section with respect to tangible
4 personal property and other tangible property, including buildings and structural components of
5 buildings, which it leases to any other person or corporation. For purposes of the preceding
6 sentence, any contract or agreement to lease or rent or for a license to use the property is considered
7 a lease.
8 (e) The credit allowed under this section for any taxable year does not reduce the tax due
9 for that year, in the case of corporations, to less than the minimum fixed by § 44-11-2(e). If the
10 amount of credit allowable under this section for any taxable year is less than the amount of credit
11 available to the taxpayer, any amount of credit not credited in that taxable year may be carried over
12 to the following year or years, up to a maximum of seven (7) years, and may be credited against
13 the taxpayer’s tax for the following year or years. For purposes of chapter 30 of this title, if the
14 credit allowed under this section for any taxable year exceeds the taxpayer’s tax for that year, the
15 amount of credit not credited in that taxable year may be carried over to the following year or years,
16 up to a maximum of seven (7) years, and may be credited against the taxpayer’s tax for the
17 following year or years.
18 (f)(1) With respect to property which is depreciable pursuant to 26 U.S.C. § 167 and which
19 is disposed of or ceases to be in qualified use prior to the end of the taxable year in which the credit
20 is to be taken, the amount of the credit is that portion of the credit provided for in this section which
21 represents the ratio which the months of qualified use bear to the months of useful life. If property
22 on which credit has been taken is disposed of or ceases to be in qualified use prior to the end of its
23 useful life, the difference between the credit taken and the credit allowed for actual use must be
24 added back in the year of disposition. If the property is disposed of or ceases to be in qualified use
25 after it has been in qualified use for more than twelve (12) consecutive years, it is not necessary to
26 add back the credit as provided in this subdivision. The amount of credit allowed for actual use is
27 determined by multiplying the original credit by the ratio which the months of qualified use bear
28 to the months of useful life. For purposes of this subdivision, “useful life of property” is the same
29 as the taxpayer uses for depreciation purposes when computing his federal income tax liability.
30 (2) Except with respect to that property to which subdivision (3) of this subsection applies,
31 with respect to three (3) year property, as defined in 26 U.S.C. § 168(c), which is disposed of or
32 ceases to be in qualified use prior to the end of the taxable year in which the credit is to be taken,
33 the amount of the credit shall be that portion of the credit provided for in this section which
34 represents the ratio which the months of qualified use bear to thirty-six (36). If property on which
Art5
RELATING TO TAXES AND FEES
(Page -37-)

1 credit has been taken is disposed of or ceases to be in qualified use prior to the end of thirty-six
2 (36) months, the difference between the credit taken and the credit allowed for actual use must be
3 added back in the year of disposition. The amount of credit allowed for actual use is determined by
4 multiplying the original credit by the ratio that the months of qualified use bear to thirty-six (36).
5 (3) With respect to any recovery property to which 26 U.S.C. § 168 applies, which is a
6 building or a structural component of a building and which is disposed of or ceases to be in qualified
7 use prior to the end of the taxable year in which the credit is to be taken, the amount of the credit
8 is that portion of the credit provided for in this section which represents the ratio which the months
9 of qualified use bear to the total number of months over which the taxpayer chooses to deduct the
10 property under 26 U.S.C. § 168. If property on which credit has been taken is disposed of or ceases
11 to be in qualified use prior to the end of the period over which the taxpayer chooses to deduct the
12 property under 26 U.S.C. § 168, the difference between the credit taken and the credit allowed for
13 actual use must be added back in the year of disposition. If the property is disposed of or ceases to
14 be in qualified use after it has been in qualified use for more than twelve (12) consecutive years, it
15 is not necessary to add back the credit as provided in this subdivision. The amount of credit allowed
16 for actual use is determined by multiplying the original credit by the ratio that the months of
17 qualified use bear to the total number of months over which the taxpayer chooses to deduct the
18 property under 26 U.S.C. § 168.
19 (g) No deduction for research and development facilities under § 44-32-1 shall be allowed
20 for research and development property for which the credit is allowed under this section.
21 (h) No investment tax credit under § 44-31-1 shall be allowed for research and development
22 property for which the credit is allowed under this section.
23 (i) The investment tax credit allowed by § 44-31-1 shall be taken into account before the
24 credit allowed under this section.
25 (j) The credit allowed under this section only allowed against the tax of that corporation
26 included in a consolidated return that qualifies for the credit and not against the tax of other
27 corporations that may join in the filing of a consolidated return.
28 (k) In the event that the taxpayer is a partnership, joint venture or small business
29 corporation, the credit shall be divided in the same manner as income.
30 (l) Sunset. No credits shall be allowed under this section for tax years beginning on or after
31 January 1, 2026. Credits allowed for tax years ending on or before December 31, 2025, may be
32 carried forward into tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2026, in accordance with subsection
33 (e) of this section.

Art5
RELATING TO TAXES AND FEES
(Page -38-)

1 (a) A taxpayer shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed by chapters 11, 17 or 30
2 of this title. The amount of the credit shall be five percent (5%)(and in the case of amounts paid or
3 accrued after January 1, 1998, twenty-two and one-half percent (22.5%) for the first twenty-five
4 thousand dollars ($25,000) worth of credit and sixteen and nine-tenths percent (16.9%) for the
5 amount of credit above twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000)) of the excess, if any, of:
6 (1) The qualified research expenses for the taxable year, over

8 (b)(1) “Qualified research expenses” and “base period research expenses” have the same
9 meaning as defined in 26 U.S.C. § 41; provided, that the expenses have been incurred in this state
10 after July 1, 1994.
11 (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection, “qualified research
12 expenses” also includes amounts expended for research by property and casualty insurance
13 companies into methods and ways of preventing or reducing losses from fire and other perils.
14 (c) The credit allowed under this section for any taxable year shall not reduce the tax due
15 for that year by more than fifty percent (50%) of the tax liability that would be payable, and in the
16 case of corporations, to less than the minimum fixed by § 44-11-2(e). If the amount of credit
17 allowable under this section for any taxable year is less than the amount of credit available to the
18 taxpayer any amount of credit not credited in that taxable year may be carried over to the following
19 year or years, up to a maximum of seven (7) years, and may be credited against the taxpayer’s tax
20 for that year or years. For purposes of chapter 30 of this title, if the credit allowed under this section
21 for any taxable year exceeds the taxpayer’s tax for that year, the amount of credit not credited in
22 that taxable year may be carried over to the following year or years, up to a maximum of seven (7)
23 years, and may be credited against the taxpayer’s tax for that year or years. For purposes of
24 determining the order in which carry-overs are taken into consideration, the credit allowed by § 44-
25 32-2 is taken into account before the credit allowed under this section.
26 (d) For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2026, the credit allowed under this section
27 for any taxable year shall not reduce the tax due for that year by more than fifty percent (50%) of
28 the tax liability that would be payable, and in the case of corporations, to less than the minimum
29 fixed by § 44-11-2(e). If the amount of credit allowable under this section for any taxable year is
30 less than the amount of credit available to the taxpayer any amount of credit not credited in that
31 taxable year may be carried over to the following year or years, up to a maximum of fifteen (15)
32 years, and may be credited against the taxpayer’s tax for that year or years. For purposes of chapter
33 30 of this title, if the credit allowed under this section for any taxable year exceeds the taxpayer’s
34 tax for that year, the amount of credit not credited in that taxable year may be carried over to the
Art5
RELATING TO TAXES AND FEES
(Page -39-)

1 following year or years, up to a maximum of fifteen (15) years, and may be credited against the
2 taxpayer’s tax for that year or years. For purposes of determining the order in which carry-overs
3 are taken into consideration, the credit allowed by § 44-32-2 is taken into account before the credit
4 allowed under this section.
5 (d)(e) The investment tax credit allowed by § 44-31-1 shall be taken into account before
6 the credit allowed under this section.
7 (e)(f) The credit allowed under this section shall only be allowed against the tax of that
8 corporation included in a consolidated return that qualifies for the credit and not against the tax of
9 other corporations that may join in the filing of a consolidated return.
10 (f)(g) In the event the taxpayer is a partnership, joint venture or small business corporation,
11 the credit is divided in the same manner as income.

Art5
RELATING TO TAXES AND FEES
(Page -41-)

1 A financial institution includes any person or entity authorized or required to participate in a
2 financial institution data match system or program for child support enforcement purposes under
3 federal or state law.
4 (b) Financial institution data match system for state tax collection purposes.
5 (1) To assist the tax administrator in the collection of debts, the division shall develop and
6 operate a financial institution data match system for the purpose of identifying and seizing the non-
7 exempt assets of delinquent taxpayers as identified by the tax administrator. The tax administrator
8 is authorized to designate a third party to develop and operate this system. Any third party
9 designated by the tax administrator to develop and operate a financial data match system must keep
10 all information it obtains from both the division and the financial institution confidential, and any
11 employee, agent or representative of that third party is prohibited from disclosing that information
12 to anyone other than the division or the financial institution.
13 (2) Each financial institution doing business in the state shall, in conjunction with the tax
14 administrator or the tax administrator’s authorized designee, develop and operate a data match
15 system to facilitate the identification and seizure of non-exempt financial assets of delinquent
16 taxpayers identified by the tax administrator or the tax administrator’s authorized designee. If a
17 financial institution has a data match system developed or used to administer the child support
18 enforcement programs of this state, and if that system is approved by the tax administrator or the
19 tax administrator’s authorized designee, the financial institution may use that system to comply
20 with the provisions of this section.
21 (c) Each financial institution must provide identifying information at least each calendar
22 quarter to the division for each delinquent taxpayer identified by the division who or that maintains
23 an account at the institution. The identifying information must include the delinquent taxpayer’s
24 name, address, and social security number or other taxpayer identification number, and all account
25 numbers and balances in each account.
26 (d) A financial institution that complies with this section will not be liable under state law
27 to any person for the disclosure of information to the tax administrator or the tax administrator’s
28 authorized designee, or any other action taken in good faith to comply with this section.
29 (e) Both the financial institution furnishing a report to the tax administrator under this
30 section and the tax administrator’s authorized designee are prohibited from disclosing to the
31 delinquent taxpayer that the name of the delinquent taxpayer has been received from or furnished
32 to the tax administrator, unless authorized in writing by the tax administrator to do so. A violation
33 of this subsection will result in the imposition of a civil penalty equal to the greater of one thousand
34 dollars ($1,000) or the amount in the account of the person to whom the disclosure was made for
Art5
RELATING TO TAXES AND FEES
(Page -42-)

2 SECTION 18. Title 44 of the General Laws entitled "TAXATION" is hereby amended by
3 adding thereto the following chapter:
4 CHAPTER 72
5 NON-OWNER OCCUPIED PROPERTY TAX ACT
6 44-72-1. Short title.
7 This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Non-Owner Occupied Property Tax
8 Act".
9 44-72-2. Purpose.
10 (a) The state funds cities and towns pursuant to chapter 13 of title 45.
11 (b) There is a compelling state interest in protecting the tax base of its cities and towns.
12 (c) There are numerous non-owner occupied residential properties throughout the cities
13 and towns of Rhode Island assessed at values over one million dollars ($1,000,000).
14 (d) The existence of such properties within a city or town has an impact on the value of
15 real property within the cities and towns and the tax base within these cities and towns.
16 (e) Non-owner occupied properties sometimes place a greater demand on essential state,
17 city or town services such as police and fire protection than do occupied properties comparably
18 assessed for real estate tax purposes.
19 (f) The residents of non-owner occupied properties are not vested with a motive to maintain
20 such properties.
21 (g) The owners of non-owner occupied properties do not always contribute a fair share of
22 the costs of providing the foregoing essential state, city or town services financed in part by real
23 estate tax revenues, which revenues are solely based on the assessed value of properties.
24 (h) Some properties are deliberately left vacant by their owners in the hope that real estate
25 values will increase, thereby enabling the owners to sell these properties at a substantial profit
26 without making any of the necessary repairs or improvements to the property.
27 (i) The non-owner occupation of such property whether for profit speculation, tax benefit,
28 or any other purposes is the making use of that property and as such, is a privilege incident to the
29 ownership of the property.
30 (j) Owners of non-owner occupied properties must be encouraged to use the properties in
31 a positive manner to stop the spread of deterioration, to increase the stock of viable real estate
32 within a city or town, and to maintain real estate values within communities.
33 (k) Owners of non-owner occupied properties must be required, through a state’s power to
34 tax, to pay a fair share of the cost of providing certain essential state services to protect the public
Art5

(Page -55-)

1 The tax authorized by this chapter shall be measured by the assessed value of the real estate
2 at the rate of two dollars and fifty cents ($2.50) for each five hundred dollars ($500) or fractional
3 part of the assessed value in excess of one million dollars ($1,000,000). For tax years beginning on
4 or after July 1, 2027, the assessed value threshold of one million dollars ($1,000,000) provided
5 pursuant to this section shall be adjusted by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index
6 for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U) as published by the United States Department of Labor Statistics
7 determined as of September 30 of the prior calendar years. Said adjustment shall be compounded
8 annually and shall be rounded up to the nearest five-dollar ($5.00) increment. In no event shall the
9 assessed value threshold in any tax year be less than the prior tax year.
10 44-72-7. Returns.
11 (a) The tax imposed by this chapter shall be due and payable in four (4) equal installments.

14 be paid on or before March 15 of the taxable year, and the fourth installment shall be paid on or

16 (b) The tax administrator is authorized to adopt rules, pursuant to this chapter, relative to
17 the form of the return and the data that it shall contain for the correct computation of the imposed
18 tax. All returns shall be signed by the taxpayer or by its authorized representative, subject to the
19 pains and penalties of perjury. If a return shows an overpayment of the tax due, the tax administrator
20 shall refund or credit the overpayment to the taxpayer.
21 (c) The tax administrator, for good cause shown, may extend the time within which a
22 taxpayer is required to file a return. If the return is filed during the period of extension, no penalty
23 or late filing charge shall be imposed for failure to file the return at the time required by this chapter;
24 however, the taxpayer shall be liable for interest as prescribed in this chapter. Failure to file the
25 return during the period for the extension shall void the extension.
26 44-72-8. Set-off for delinquent payment of tax.
27 If a taxpayer shall fail to pay a tax within thirty (30) days of its due date, the tax
28 administrator may request any agency of state government making payments to the taxpayer to set-
29 off the amount of the delinquency against any payment due the taxpayer from the agency of state
30 government and remit the sum to the tax administrator. Upon receipt of the set-off request from the
31 tax administrator, any agency of state government is authorized and empowered to set-off the
32 amount of the delinquency against any payment or amounts due the taxpayer. The amount of set-
33 off shall be credited against the tax due from the taxpayer.

4 due, the tax administrator shall assess the tax upon the information as may be available, which shall
5 be payable upon demand and shall bear interest at the annual rate provided by § 44-1-7, from the
6 date when the tax should have been paid. If any part of the tax not paid is due to negligence or
7 intentional disregard of the provisions of this chapter, a penalty of ten percent (10%) of the amount
8 of the determination shall be added to the tax. The tax administrator shall collect the tax with
9 interest in the same manner and with the same powers as are prescribed for collection of taxes in
10 this title.
11 44-72-10. Claims for refund - Hearing upon denial.
12 (a) Any taxpayer subject to the provisions of this chapter, may file a claim for refund with
13 the tax administrator at any time within two (2) years after the tax has been paid. If the tax

15 interest from the date of overpayment.

22 of any tax or penalty imposed under the provisions of this chapter may apply to the tax
23 administrator, within thirty (30) days after the notice of the action is mailed to the taxpayer, for a
24 hearing relative to the tax or penalty. The tax administrator shall fix a time and place for the hearing
25 and shall so notify the taxpayer. Upon the hearing, the tax administrator shall correct manifest
26 errors, if any, disclosed at the hearing and thereupon assess and collect the amount lawfully due
27 together with any penalty or interest thereon.
28 44-72-12. Appeals.
29 (a) In any appeal from the imposition of the tax set forth in this chapter, the tax
30 administrator shall find in favor of an appellant who shows that the property assessed:
31 (1) Was actively occupied by the owner during the taxable year for more than six (6)
32 months; or
33 (2) Was exempt pursuant to the general laws or public laws from the imposition of the tax
34 set forth in this chapter.
Art5
RELATING TO TAXES AND FEES
(Page -57-)

1 (b) Appeals from administrative orders or decisions made pursuant to any provisions of
2 this chapter shall be to the sixth division district court pursuant to chapter 8 of title 8. The taxpayer’s
3 right to appeal under this section shall be expressly made conditional upon prepayment of all taxes,
4 interest, and penalties unless the taxpayer moves for and is granted an exemption from the
5 prepayment requirement pursuant to § 8-8-26. If the court, after appeal, holds that the taxpayer is
6 entitled to a refund, the taxpayer shall also be paid interest on the amount at the rate provided in §
7 44-1-7.1.
8 44-72-13. Taxpayer records.
9 Every taxpayer shall:

18 upon demand, at reasonable times during regular business hours.

21 procedures not inconsistent with state law and fiscal procedures as the administrator deems
22 necessary for the proper administration of this chapter and to carry out the provisions, policies, and
23 purposes of this chapter.
24 44-72-15. Severability.
25 If any provision of this chapter or the application of this chapter to any person or
26 circumstances is held invalid, that invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of the
27 chapter that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the
28 provisions of this chapter are declared to be severable. It is declared to be the legislative intent that
29 this chapter would have been adopted had those provisions not been included or that person,
30 circumstance, or time period been expressly excluded from its coverage.
31 SECTION 19. Sections 3, 4, 5, 12 and 16 through 18 shall take effect upon passage.

11 (other than with respect to the tax imposed under § 44-13-13), 14, 17, or 30 of this title, as
12 applicable, for the year of revocation, recapture, or adjustment, shall be increased by including the
13 total amount of the sales proceeds without proration.
14 (g) Credits allowed to partners, members, or owners that are exempt from taxation under
15 section 501(c)(3), section (c)(4) or section 501(c)(6) of the U.S. Code, and only said credits, shall
16 be fully refundable.
17 (h) Substantial rehabilitation of property that either:
18 (1) Is exempt from real property tax;
19 (2) Is a social club; or
20 (3) Consists of a single-family home or a property that contains less than three (3)
21 residential apartments or condominiums shall be ineligible for the tax credits authorized under this
22 chapter; provided, however, a scattered site development with five (5) or more residential units in
23 the aggregate (which may include single-family homes) shall be eligible for tax credit. In the event
24 a certified historic structure undergoes a substantial rehabilitation pursuant to this chapter and
25 within twenty-four (24) months after issuance of a certificate of completed work the property
26 becomes exempt from real property tax, the taxpayer’s tax for the year shall be increased by the
27 total amount of credit actually used against the tax.
28 (i) In the case of a corporation, this credit is only allowed against the tax of a corporation
29 included in a consolidated return that qualifies for the credit and not against the tax of other
30 corporations that may join in the filing of a consolidated tax return.
31 (j) For construction projects awarded a tax credit agreement on or after July 1, 2025, and
32 involving a budget of direct hard construction costs (as defined in § 44-33.6-2) in excess of ten
33 million dollars ($10,000,000) twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000), all construction workers

3 SECTION 1. Section 16-7-22 of the General Laws in Chapter 16-7 entitled "Foundation
4 Level School Support [See Title 16 Chapter 97 — The Rhode Island Board of Education Act]" is
5 hereby amended to read as follows:
6 16-7-22. Determination of average daily membership.
7 Each community shall be paid pursuant to the provisions of § 16-7-17 an amount based
8 upon the following provisions:
9 (1) On or before September 1 of each year the average daily membership of each city and
10 town for the reference year shall be determined by the commissioner of elementary and secondary
11 education from data supplied by the school committee in each community in the following manner:
12 The aggregate number of days of membership of all pupils enrolled full time in grade twelve (12)
13 and below, except that pupils below grade one who are not full time shall be counted on a full-time
14 equivalent basis: (i) Increased by the aggregate number of days of membership of pupils residing
15 in the particular city or town whose tuition in schools approved by the department of elementary
16 and secondary education in other cities and towns is paid by the particular city or town; and (ii)
17 Decreased by the aggregate number of days of membership of nonresident pupils enrolled in the
18 public schools of the particular city or town and further decreased by the aggregate number of days
19 of membership equal to the number of group home beds calculated for the purposes of
20 reimbursement pursuant to § 16-64-1.1; and (iii) Decreased further, in the case of a city or town
21 that is a member of a regional school district during the first year of operation of the regional school
22 district by the aggregate number of days of membership of pupils residing in the city or town who
23 would have attended the public schools in the regional school district if the regional school district
24 had been operating during the previous year, divided by the number of days during which the
25 schools were officially in session during the reference year. The resulting figures shall be the
26 average daily membership for the city or town for the reference year. For purposes of calculating
27 the permanent foundation education aid as described in § 16-7.2-3(1) and (2), the average daily
28 membership for school districts shall exclude charter school and state school students, and
29 beginning in school year 2014-2015, include an estimate to ensure that districts converting from a
30 half-day to a full-day kindergarten program pursuant to § 16-99-4 are credited on a full-time basis

1 beginning in the first year of enrollment and are funded notwithstanding the transition plan pursuant
2 to § 16-7.2-7.
3 (2) The average daily membership of pupils attending public schools shall apply for the
4 purposes of determining the percentage of the state’s share under the provisions of §§ 16-7-16(3),
5 16-7-16(10), 16-7-18, 16-7-19, 16-7-20, 16-7-21, and 16-7.2-4.
6 (3) In the case of regional school districts, the aggregate number of days of membership by
7 which each city or town is decreased in subsection (1)(iii) of this section, divided by the number of
8 days during which the schools attended by the pupils were officially in session, shall determine the
9 average daily membership for the regional school district during the first year of operation. After
10 the first year of operation, the average daily membership of each regional school district, except
11 the Chariho regional high school district, shall be determined by the commissioner of elementary
12 and secondary education from data supplied by the school committee of each regional school
13 district for the reference year in the manner provided in subsection (1) of this section.
14 (4) For all fiscal years beginning after June 30, 2024, notwithstanding subsection (1)(ii)
15 above, the decrease for group home beds shall not apply to residential facility “beds” located or
16 associated with the CRAFT program pursuant to § 16-64-1.1.
17 SECTION 2. Sections 16-7.2-3 and 16-7.2-5 of the General Laws in Chapter 16-7.2 entitled
18 "The Education Equity and Property Tax Relief Act" are hereby amended to read as follows:
19 16-7.2-3. Permanent foundation education aid established.
20 (a) Beginning in the 2012 fiscal year, the following foundation education-aid formula shall
21 take effect. The foundation education aid for each district shall be the sum of the core instruction
22 amount in subsection (a)(1) of this section and the amount to support high-need students in
23 subsection (a)(2) of this section, which shall be multiplied by the district state-share ratio calculated
24 pursuant to § 16-7.2-4 to determine the foundation aid.
25 (1) The core instruction amount shall be an amount equal to a statewide, per-pupil core
26 instruction amount as established by the department of elementary and secondary education,
27 derived from the average of northeast regional expenditure data for the states of Rhode Island,
28 Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New Hampshire from the National Center for Education Statistics
29 (NCES) that will adequately fund the student instructional needs as described in the basic education
30 program and multiplied by the district average daily membership as defined in § 16-7-22.
31 Expenditure data in the following categories: instruction and support services for students,
32 instruction, general administration, school administration, and other support services from the
33 National Public Education Financial Survey, as published by NCES, and enrollment data from the
34 Common Core of Data, also published by NCES, will be used when determining the core
Art7
RELATING TO EDUCATION
(Page -2-)

1 instruction amount. The core instruction amount will be updated annually. For the purpose of
2 calculating this formula, school districts’ resident average daily membership shall exclude charter
3 school and state-operated school students.
4 (2) The amount to support high-need students beyond the core instruction amount shall be
5 determined by:
6 (i) Multiplying a student success factor of forty percent (40%) by the core instruction per-
7 pupil amount described in subsection (a)(1) of this section and applying that amount for each
8 resident child whose family income is at or below one hundred eighty-five percent (185%) of
9 federal poverty guidelines, hereinafter referred to as “poverty status.” By October 1, 2022, as part
10 of its budget submission pursuant to § 35-3-4 relative to state fiscal year 2024 and thereafter, the
11 department of elementary and secondary education shall develop and utilize a poverty measure that
12 in the department’s assessment most accurately serves as a proxy for the poverty status referenced
13 in this subsection and does not rely on the administration of school nutrition programs. The
14 department shall utilize this measure in calculations pursuant to this subsection related to the
15 application of the student success factor, in calculations pursuant to § 16-7.2-4 related to the
16 calculation of the state share ratio, and in the formulation of estimates pursuant to subsection (b)
17 below. The department may also include any recommendations which seek to mitigate any
18 disruptions associated with the implementation of this new poverty measure or improve the
19 accuracy of its calculation. Beginning with the FY 2024 calculation, students whose family income
20 is at or below one hundred eighty-five percent (185%) of federal poverty guidelines will be
21 determined by participation in the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP). The number
22 of students directly certified through the department of human services shall be multiplied by a
23 factor of 1.6; and
24 (ii) Multiplying a multilingual learner (MLL) factor of twenty percent (20%) by the core
25 instruction per-pupil amount described in subsection (a)(1) of this section, applying that amount
26 for each resident child identified in the three lowest proficiency categories using widely adopted,
27 independent standards and assessments in accordance with subsection (f)(1) of this section and as
28 identified by the commissioner and defined by regulations of the council on elementary and
29 secondary education. Local education agencies shall report annually to the department of
30 elementary and secondary education by September 1, outlining the planned and prior year use of
31 all funding pursuant to this subsection to provide services to MLL students in accordance with
32 requirements set forth by the commissioner of elementary and secondary education. The
33 department shall review the use of funds to ensure consistency with established best practices.
34 (b) The department of elementary and secondary education shall provide an estimate of the
Art7
RELATING TO EDUCATION
(Page -3-)

1 foundation education aid cost as part of its budget submission pursuant to § 35-3-4. The estimate
2 shall include the most recent data available as well as an adjustment for average daily membership
3 growth or decline based on the prior year experience.
4 (c) In addition, the department shall report updated figures based on the average daily
5 membership as of October 1 by December 1.
6 (d) Local education agencies may set aside a portion of funds received under subsection
7 (a) to expand learning opportunities such as after school and summer programs, full-day
8 kindergarten and/or multiple pathway programs, provided that the basic education program and all
9 other approved programs required in law are funded.
10 (e) The department of elementary and secondary education shall promulgate such
11 regulations as are necessary to implement fully the purposes of this chapter.
12 (f)(1) By October 1, 2023, as part of its budget submission pursuant to § 35-3-4 relative to
13 state fiscal year 2025, the department of elementary and secondary education shall evaluate the
14 number of students by district who qualify as multilingual learner (MLL) students and MLL
15 students whose family income is at or below one hundred eighty-five percent (185%) of federal
16 poverty guidelines. The submission shall also include segmentation of these populations by levels
17 as dictated by the WIDA multilingual learner assessment tool used as an objective benchmark for
18 English proficiency. The department shall also prepare and produce expense data sourced from the
19 uniform chart of accounts to recommend funding levels required to support students at the various
20 levels of proficiency as determined by the WIDA assessment tool. Utilizing this information, the
21 department shall recommend a funding solution to meet the needs of multilingual learners; this may
22 include but not be limited to inclusion of MLL needs within the core foundation formula amount
23 through one or multiple weights to distinguish different students of need or through categorical
24 means.
25 (2) By October 1, 2024, as part of its budget submission pursuant to § 35-3-4 relative to
26 state fiscal year 2026, the department of elementary and secondary education shall develop
27 alternatives to identify students whose family income is at or below one hundred eighty-five percent
28 (185%) of federal poverty guidelines through participation in state-administered programs,
29 including, but not limited to, the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP), and RIteCare
30 and other programs that include the collection of required supporting documentation. The
31 department may also include any recommendations that seek to mitigate any disruptions associated
32 with implementation of this new poverty measure or improve the accuracy of its calculation.
33 (3) The department shall also report with its annual budget request information regarding
34 local contributions to education aid and compliance with §§ 16-7-23 and 16-7-24. The report shall
Art7
RELATING TO EDUCATION
(Page -4-)

1 also compare these local contributions to state foundation education aid by community. The
2 department shall also report compliance to each city or town school committee and city or town
3 council.
4 (4) By October 1, 2025, as part of its budget submission pursuant to § 35-3-4 relative to
5 state fiscal year 2027, the department of elementary and secondary education shall submit a report
6 developed in coordination with the department of administration and the Rhode Island longitudinal
7 data system within the office of the postsecondary commissioner. The report shall provide an
8 overview of the process for matching the department of human services program participation data
9 to the department of elementary and secondary education student enrollment records for use in the
10 education funding formula and recommend methods to ensure consistency and accuracy in future
11 matching processes.
12 (5) As part of its FY 2027 budget submission, the department shall also submit an estimate
13 of foundation education aid that uses expanded direct certification with Medicaid matching in
14 consultation with the Rhode Island longitudinal data system and the executive office of health and
15 human services to identify students whose family income is at or below one hundred eighty-five
16 percent (185%) of federal poverty guidelines, in addition to an estimate under the current law
17 poverty determination.
18 (6) By December 31, 2025, the department of elementary and secondary education shall
19 also develop and submit a report to the governor, speaker of the house, and senate president on
20 current and recommended processes to ensure the consistency and validity of submitted high-cost
21 special education data from local education agencies.
22 16-7.2-5. Charter public schools, the William M. Davies, Jr. Career and Technical
23 High School, and the Metropolitan Regional Career and Technical Center.
24 (a) Charter public schools, as defined in chapter 77 of this title, the William M. Davies, Jr.
25 Career and Technical High School (Davies), and the Metropolitan Regional Career and Technical
26 Center (the Met Center) shall be funded pursuant to § 16-7.2-3. If the October 1 actual enrollment
27 data for any charter public school shows a ten percent (10%) or greater change from the prior year
28 enrollment that is used as the reference year average daily membership, the last six (6) monthly
29 payments to the charter public school will be adjusted to reflect actual enrollment. The state share
30 of the permanent foundation education aid shall be paid by the state directly to the charter public
31 schools, Davies, and the Met Center pursuant to § 16-7.2-9 and shall be calculated using the state-
32 share ratio of the district of residence of the student as set forth in § 16-7.2-4. The department of
33 elementary and secondary education shall provide the general assembly with the calculation of the
34 state share of permanent foundation education aid for charter public schools delineated by school
Art7
RELATING TO EDUCATION
(Page -5-)

1 district.
2 (b) The local share of education funding shall be paid to the charter public school, Davies,
3 and the Met Center by the district of residence of the student and shall be the local, per-pupil cost
4 calculated by dividing the local appropriation to education from property taxes, net of debt service,
5 and capital projects, as defined in the uniform chart of accounts by the average daily membership
6 for each city and town, pursuant to § 16-7-22, for the reference year.
7 (c) Beginning in FY 2017, there shall be a reduction to the local per-pupil funding paid by
8 the district of residence to charter public schools, Davies, and the Met Center. This reduction shall
9 be equal to the greater (i) Of seven percent (7%) of the local, per-pupil funding of the district of
10 residence pursuant to subsection (b) or (ii) The per-pupil value of the district’s costs for non-public
11 textbooks, transportation for non-public students, retiree health benefits, out-of-district special-
12 education tuition and transportation, services for students age eighteen (18) to twenty-one (21)
13 years old, pre-school screening and intervention, and career and technical education, tuition and
14 transportation costs, debt service and rental costs minus the average expenses incurred by charter
15 schools for those same categories of expenses as reported in the uniform chart of accounts for the
16 prior preceding fiscal year pursuant to § 16-7-16(11) and verified by the department of elementary
17 and secondary education. In the case where audited financials result in a change in the calculation
18 after the first tuition payment is made, the remaining payments shall be based on the most recent
19 audited data. For those districts whose greater reduction occurs under the calculation of (ii), there
20 shall be an additional reduction to payments to mayoral academies with teachers who do not
21 participate in the state teacher’s retirement system under chapter 8 of title 36 equal to the per-pupil
22 value of teacher retirement costs attributable to unfunded liability as calculated by the state’s
23 actuary for the prior preceding fiscal year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, beginning with FY 2026,
24 the reduction to the local per-pupil funding shall not exceed fourteen percent (14%).
25 (d) Local district payments to charter public schools, Davies, and the Met Center for each
26 district’s students enrolled in these schools shall be made on a quarterly basis in July, October,
27 January, and April; however, the first local-district payment shall be made by August 15, instead
28 of July. Failure of the community to make the local-district payment for its student(s) enrolled in a
29 charter public school, Davies, and/or the Met Center may result in the withholding of state
30 education aid pursuant to § 16-7-31.
31 (e) Beginning in FY 2017, school districts with charter public school, Davies, and the Met
32 Center enrollment, that, combined, comprise five percent (5%) or more of the average daily
33 membership as defined in § 16-7-22, shall receive additional aid for a period of three (3) years. Aid
34 in FY 2017 shall be equal to the number of charter public school, open-enrollment schools, Davies,
Art7
RELATING TO EDUCATION
(Page -6-)

1 or the Met Center students as of the reference year as defined in § 16-7-16 times a per-pupil amount
2 of one hundred seventy-five dollars ($175). Aid in FY 2018 shall be equal to the number of charter
3 public school, open-enrollment schools, Davies, or the Met Center students as of the reference year
4 as defined in § 16-7-16 times a per-pupil amount of one hundred dollars ($100). Aid in FY 2019
5 shall be equal to the number of charter public school, open-enrollment schools, Davies, or the Met
6 Center students as of the reference year as defined in § 16-7-16 times a per-pupil amount of fifty
7 dollars ($50.00). The additional aid shall be used to offset the adjusted fixed costs retained by the
8 districts of residence.

10 SECTION 3. Section 16-64-1.1 of the General Laws in Chapter 16-64 entitled "Residence
11 of Children for School Purposes" is hereby amended to read as follows:
12 16-64-1.1. Payment and reimbursement for educational costs of children placed in
13 foster care, group homes, or other residential facility by a Rhode Island state agency.
14 (a) Children placed in foster care by a Rhode Island-licensed child-placing agency or a
15 Rhode Island governmental agency shall be entitled to the same free, appropriate public education
16 provided to all other residents of the city or town where the child is placed. The city or town shall
17 pay the cost of the education of the child during the time the child is in foster care in the city or
18 town.
19 (b) Children placed by the department of children, youth and families (DCYF) in a group
20 home or other residential facility that does not include the delivery of educational services are to
21 be educated by the community in which the group home or other residential facility is located, and
22 those children shall be entitled to the same free, appropriate public education provided to all other
23 residents of the city or town where the child is placed. For purposes of payment and reimbursement
24 for educational costs under this chapter, the term “group home or other residential facility” shall
25 not include independent-living programs or the Children's Residential and Family Treatment
26 (CRAFT) program located on the East Providence campus of Bradley Hospital. Each city and town
27 that contains one or more group homes or other residential facilities that do not include delivery of
28 educational services will receive funds as part of state aid to education in accordance with the
29 following provisions:
30 (1) On December 31 of each year, the DCYF shall provide the department of elementary
31 and secondary education with a precise count of how many group home or other residential facility
32 “beds” exist in each Rhode Island city or town, counting only those “beds” in facilities that do not
33 include the delivery of educational services. The number of “beds” in each group home or other
34 residential facility shall be equal to the maximum number of children who may be placed in that
Art7
RELATING TO EDUCATION
(Page -7-)

1 group home or other residential facility on any given night according to the applicable licensure
2 standards of the DCYF.
3 (2) For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2007, if the number of beds certified by DCYF for
4 a school district by December 31, 2007, is greater than the number certified March 14, 2007, upon
5 which the education aid for FY 2008 was appropriated, the education aid for that district will be
6 increased by the number of increased beds multiplied by fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000).
7 Notwithstanding the provisions of this section or any law to the contrary, the education aid for all
8 group home or other residential facility “beds” located or associated with the Children’s Residential
9 and Family Treatment (CRAFT) program located on the East Providence campus of Bradley
10 Hospital shall be twenty-two thousand dollars ($22,000) per bed. The Department of Elementary
11 and Secondary Education shall include the additional aid in equal payments in March, April, May,
12 and June, and the Governor’s budget recommendations pursuant to § 35-3-8 shall include the
13 amounts required to provide the increased aid.
14 For all fiscal years beginning after June 30, 2016, education aid for each school district
15 shall include seventeen thousand dollars ($17,000) for each bed certified by DCYF by the preceding
16 December 31. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section or any law to the contrary, the
17 education aid for all group home or other residential facility “beds” located or associated with the
18 Children’s Residential and Family Treatment (CRAFT) program located on the East Providence
19 campus of Bradley Hospital shall be twenty-six thousand dollars ($26,000) per bed. For all fiscal
20 years beginning after June 30, 2008, whenever the number of beds certified by DCYF for a school
21 district by December 31 is greater than the number certified the prior December 31 upon which the
22 education aid for that fiscal year was appropriated, the education aid for that district as enacted by
23 the assembly during the prior legislative session for that fiscal year will be increased by the number
24 of increased beds multiplied by the amount per bed authorized for that fiscal year. The Department
25 of Elementary and Secondary Education shall include the additional aid in equal payments in
26 March, April, May, and June, and the Governor’s budget recommendations pursuant to § 35-3-8
27 shall include the amounts required to provide the increased aid.
28 (c) Children placed by DCYF in a residential-treatment program, group home, or other
29 residential facility, whether or not located in the state of Rhode Island, which includes the delivery
30 of educational services provided by that facility (excluding facilities where students are taught on
31 grounds for periods of time by teaching staff provided by the school district in which the facility is
32 located), shall have the cost of their education paid for as provided for in subsection (d) and § 16-
33 64-1.2. The city or town determined to be responsible to DCYF for a per-pupil special-education
34 cost pursuant to § 16-64-1.2 shall pay its share of the cost of educational services to DCYF or to
Art7
RELATING TO EDUCATION
(Page -8-)

1 the facility providing educational services.
2 (d) Children placed by DCYF in group homes, child-caring facilities, community
3 residences, or other residential facilities shall have the entire cost of their education paid for by
4 DCYF if:
5 (1) The facility is operated by the state of Rhode Island or the facility has a contract with
6 DCYF to fund a pre-determined number of placements or part of the facility’s program;
7 (2) The facility is state licensed; and
8 (3) The facility operates an approved, on-grounds educational program, whether or not the
9 child attends the on-grounds program.
10 (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other law, effective June 30, 2025, neither the
11 East Providence public schools nor the city of East Providence shall be responsible to provide any
12 educational or related services or instruction or have any financial responsibility for any student
13 attending the CRAFT program unless East Providence is that student's district of origin. The school
14 district of origin shall be responsible to provide any pay for such services and instruction consistent
15 with applicable state law and regulation. For purposes of this section, "school district of origin"
16 means the school district in which the student was last registered to attend prior to admission to the
17 CRAFT program. The East Providence school district shall not be paid reimbursement as provided
18 in this statute for such students.

3 SECTION 1. Section 23-17-38.1 of the General Laws in Chapter 23-17 entitled "Licensing
4 of Healthcare Facilities" is hereby amended to read as follows:
5 23-17-38.1. Hospitals — Licensing fee.
6 (a) There is imposed a hospital licensing fee for state fiscal year 2023 against each hospital
7 in the state. The hospital licensing fee is equal to five and forty-two hundredths percent (5.42%) of
8 the net patient-services revenue of every hospital for the hospital’s first fiscal year ending on or
9 after January 1, 2021, except that the license fee for all hospitals located in Washington County,
10 Rhode Island shall be discounted by thirty-seven percent (37%). The discount for Washington
11 County hospitals is subject to approval by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and
12 Human Services of a state plan amendment submitted by the executive office of health and human
13 services for the purpose of pursuing a waiver of the uniformity requirement for the hospital license
14 fee. This licensing fee shall be administered and collected by the tax administrator, division of

28 and in effect on October 1, 2024, both fee-for-service and managed care, will be increased by two
29 and three-tenths percent (2.3%) There shall also be a base rate staffing adjustment of three percent

31 adjustment shall be expended by each nursing facility to increase compensation, wages, benefits,
32 and related employer costs, for eligible direct-care staff, including the cost of hiring additional
33 eligible direct-care positions, as defined in subsection (a)(2)(vi). The inflation index shall be
34 applied without regard for the transition factors in subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2). For purposes of

10 U.S.C. § 201 et seq.); or (ii) CNAs, certified medical technicians, RNs, or LPNs who are contracted,
11 or subcontracted, through a third-party vendor or staffing agency. By July 31, 2017, nursing

15 clawback, paid by the nursing facility to the state, in the amount of increased reimbursement subject
16 to this provision that was not expended in compliance with that certification.
17 (3) Commencing on October 1, 2021, eighty percent (80%) of any rate increase that results
18 from application of the inflation index to subsections (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(ii) of this section shall be
19 dedicated to increase compensation for all eligible direct-care workers in the following manner on
20 October 1, of each year.
21 (i) For purposes of this subsection, compensation increases shall include base salary or

2 (4)(i) By July 31, 2021, and July 31 of each year thereafter, nursing facilities shall submit
3 to the secretary or designee a certification that they have complied with the provisions of subsection
4 (a)(3) of this section with respect to the inflation index applied on October 1. The executive office

6 complete with information on how each individual eligible employee’s compensation increased,
7 including information regarding hourly wages prior to the increase and after the compensation
8 increase, hours paid after the compensation increase, and associated increased payroll taxes. A
9 collective bargaining agreement can be used in lieu of the certification form for represented
10 employees. All data reported on the compliance form is subject to review and audit by EOHHS.
11 The audits may include field or desk audits, and facilities may be required to provide additional
12 supporting documents including, but not limited to, payroll records.
13 (ii) Any facility that does not comply with the terms of certification shall be subjected to a
14 clawback and twenty-five percent (25%) penalty of the unspent or impermissibly spent funds, paid
15 by the nursing facility to the state, in the amount of increased reimbursement subject to this
16 provision that was not expended in compliance with that certification.
17 (iii) In any calendar year where no inflationary index is applied, eighty percent (80%) of
18 the base rate staffing adjustment in that calendar year pursuant to subsection (a)(2)(vi) of this
19 section shall be dedicated to increase compensation for all eligible direct-care workers in the
20 manner referenced in subsections (a)(3)(i), (a)(3)(i)(A), and (a)(3)(i)(B) of this section.
21 (b) Transition to full implementation of rate reform. For no less than four (4) years after
22 the initial application of the price-based methodology described in subsection (a)(2) to payment
23 rates, the executive office of health and human services shall implement a transition plan to
24 moderate the impact of the rate reform on individual nursing facilities. The transition shall include
25 the following components:
26 (1) No nursing facility shall receive reimbursement for direct-care costs that is less than
27 the rate of reimbursement for direct-care costs received under the methodology in effect at the time
28 of passage of this act; for the year beginning October 1, 2017, the reimbursement for direct-care
29 costs under this provision will be phased out in twenty-five-percent (25%) increments each year
30 until October 1, 2021, when the reimbursement will no longer be in effect; and
31 (2) No facility shall lose or gain more than five dollars ($5.00) in its total, per diem rate the
32 first year of the transition. An adjustment to the per diem loss or gain may be phased out by twenty-
33 five percent (25%) each year; except, however, for the years beginning October 1, 2015, there shall
34 be no adjustment to the per diem gain or loss, but the phase out shall resume thereafter; and
Art8
RELATING TO MEDICAL ASSISTANCE
(Page -13-)

1 (3) The transition plan and/or period may be modified upon full implementation of facility
2 per diem rate increases for quality of care-related measures. Said modifications shall be submitted
3 in a report to the general assembly at least six (6) months prior to implementation.
4 (4) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, for the twelve-month (12) period beginning
5 July 1, 2015, Medicaid payment rates for nursing facilities established pursuant to this section shall
6 not exceed ninety-eight percent (98%) of the rates in effect on April 1, 2015. Consistent with the
7 other provisions of this chapter, nothing in this provision shall require the executive office to restore
8 the rates to those in effect on April 1, 2015, at the end of this twelve-month (12) period.
9 SECTION 5. Sections 40-8.3-2 and 40-8.3-3 of the General Laws in Chapter 40-8.3 entitled

17 (2) “Medicaid inpatient utilization rate for a hospital” means a fraction (expressed as a
18 percentage), the numerator of which is the hospital’s number of inpatient days during the base year
19 attributable to patients who were eligible for medical assistance during the base year and the
20 denominator of which is the total number of the hospital’s inpatient days in the base year.
21 (3) “Participating hospital” means any nongovernment and nonpsychiatric hospital that:
22 (i) Was licensed as a hospital in accordance with chapter 17 of title 23 during the base year
23 and shall mean the actual facilities and buildings in existence in Rhode Island, licensed pursuant to

26 17-6(b) (change in effective control), that provides short-term, acute inpatient and/or outpatient
27 care to persons who require definitive diagnosis and treatment for injury, illness, disabilities, or
28 pregnancy. Notwithstanding the preceding language, the negotiated Medicaid managed care
29 payment rates for a court-approved purchaser that acquires a hospital through receivership, special
30 mastership, or other similar state insolvency proceedings (which court-approved purchaser is issued
31 a hospital license after January 1, 2013), shall be based upon the newly negotiated rates between
32 the court-approved purchaser and the health plan, and the rates shall be effective as of the date that
33 the court-approved purchaser and the health plan execute the initial agreement containing the newly
34 negotiated rate. The rate-setting methodology for inpatient hospital payments and outpatient
Art8

3 following the completion of the first full year of the court-approved purchaser’s initial Medicaid
4 managed care contract;
5 (ii) Achieved a medical assistance inpatient utilization rate of at least one percent (1%)
6 during the base year; and
7 (iii) Continues to be licensed as a hospital in accordance with chapter 17 of title 23 during
8 the payment year.
9 (4) “Uncompensated-care costs” means, as to any hospital, the sum of: (i) The cost incurred
10 by the hospital during the base year for inpatient or outpatient services attributable to charity care
11 (free care and bad debts) for which the patient has no health insurance or other third-party coverage
12 less payments, if any, received directly from such patients; (ii) The cost incurred by the hospital
13 during the base year for inpatient or outpatient services attributable to Medicaid beneficiaries less
14 any Medicaid reimbursement received therefor; and (iii) the sum of subsections (4)(i) and (4)(ii) of
15 this section shall be offset by the estimated hospital’s commercial equivalent rates state directed
16 payment for the current SFY in which the disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payment is made.
17 The sum of subsections (4)(i), (4)(ii), and (4)(iii) of this section shall be multiplied by the
18 uncompensated care index.
19 (5) “Uncompensated-care index” means the annual percentage increase for hospitals
20 established pursuant to § 27-19-14 [repealed] for each year after the base year, up to and including
21 the payment year; provided, however, that the uncompensated-care index for the payment year
22 ending September 30, 2007, shall be deemed to be five and thirty-eight hundredths percent (5.38%),
23 and that the uncompensated-care index for the payment year ending September 30, 2008, shall be
24 deemed to be five and forty-seven hundredths percent (5.47%), and that the uncompensated-care
25 index for the payment year ending September 30, 2009, shall be deemed to be five and thirty-eight
26 hundredths percent (5.38%), and that the uncompensated-care index for the payment years ending
27 September 30, 2010, September 30, 2011, September 30, 2012, September 30, 2013, September
28 30, 2014, September 30, 2015, September 30, 2016, September 30, 2017, September 30, 2018,
29 September 30, 2019, September 30, 2020, September 30, 2021, September 30, 2022, September
30 30, 2023, September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2025, and September 30, 2026, shall be deemed
31 to be five and thirty hundredths percent (5.30%).

23 (f) [Deleted by P.L. 2019, ch. 88, art. 13, § 6.]
24 SECTION 6. Section 40-8.9-9 of the General Laws in Chapter 40-8.9 entitled "Medical
25 Assistance — Long-Term Care Service and Finance Reform" is hereby amended to read as follows:
26 40-8.9-9. Long-term-care rebalancing system reform goal.
27 (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of state law, the executive office of health and
28 human services is authorized and directed to apply for, and obtain, any necessary waiver(s), waiver
29 amendment(s), and/or state-plan amendments from the Secretary of the United States Department
30 of Health and Human Services, and to promulgate rules necessary to adopt an affirmative plan of
31 program design and implementation that addresses the goal of allocating a minimum of fifty percent
32 (50%) of Medicaid long-term-care funding for persons aged sixty-five (65) and over and adults
33 with disabilities, in addition to services for persons with developmental disabilities, to home- and
34 community-based care; provided, further, the executive office shall report annually as part of its
Art8
RELATING TO MEDICAL ASSISTANCE
(Page -18-)

1 budget submission, the percentage distribution between institutional care and home- and
2 community-based care by population and shall report current and projected waiting lists for long-
3 term-care and home- and community-based care services. The executive office is further authorized
4 and directed to prioritize investments in home- and community-based care and to maintain the
5 integrity and financial viability of all current long-term-care services while pursuing this goal.
6 (b) The reformed long-term-care system rebalancing goal is person-centered and
7 encourages individual self-determination, family involvement, interagency collaboration, and
8 individual choice through the provision of highly specialized and individually tailored home-based
9 services. Additionally, individuals with severe behavioral, physical, or developmental disabilities
10 must have the opportunity to live safe and healthful lives through access to a wide range of
11 supportive services in an array of community-based settings, regardless of the complexity of their
12 medical condition, the severity of their disability, or the challenges of their behavior. Delivery of
13 services and supports in less-costly and less-restrictive community settings will enable children,
14 adolescents, and adults to be able to curtail, delay, or avoid lengthy stays in long-term-care
15 institutions, such as behavioral health residential-treatment facilities, long-term-care hospitals,
16 intermediate-care facilities, and/or skilled nursing facilities.
17 (c) Pursuant to federal authority procured under § 42-7.2-16, the executive office of health
18 and human services is directed and authorized to adopt a tiered set of criteria to be used to determine
19 eligibility for services. The criteria shall be developed in collaboration with the state’s health and
20 human services departments and, to the extent feasible, any consumer group, advisory board, or
21 other entity designated for these purposes, and shall encompass eligibility determinations for long-
22 term-care services in nursing facilities, hospitals, and intermediate-care facilities for persons with
23 intellectual disabilities, as well as home- and community-based alternatives, and shall provide a
24 common standard of income eligibility for both institutional and home- and community-based care.
25 The executive office is authorized to adopt clinical and/or functional criteria for admission to a
26 nursing facility, hospital, or intermediate-care facility for persons with intellectual disabilities that
27 are more stringent than those employed for access to home- and community-based services. The
28 executive office is also authorized to promulgate rules that define the frequency of re-assessments
29 for services provided for under this section. Levels of care may be applied in accordance with the
30 following:
31 (1) The executive office shall continue to apply the level-of-care criteria in effect on April
32 1, 2021, for any recipient determined eligible for and receiving Medicaid-funded long-term services
33 and supports in a nursing facility, hospital, or intermediate-care facility for persons with intellectual
34 disabilities on or before that date, unless:
Art8
RELATING TO MEDICAL ASSISTANCE
(Page -19-)

1 (i) The recipient transitions to home- and community-based services because he or she
2 would no longer meet the level-of-care criteria in effect on April 1, 2021; or
3 (ii) The recipient chooses home- and community-based services over the nursing facility,
4 hospital, or intermediate-care facility for persons with intellectual disabilities. For the purposes of
5 this section, a failed community placement, as defined in regulations promulgated by the executive
6 office, shall be considered a condition of clinical eligibility for the highest level of care. The
7 executive office shall confer with the long-term-care ombudsperson with respect to the
8 determination of a failed placement under the ombudsperson’s jurisdiction. Should any Medicaid
9 recipient eligible for a nursing facility, hospital, or intermediate-care facility for persons with
10 intellectual disabilities as of April 1, 2021, receive a determination of a failed community
11 placement, the recipient shall have access to the highest level of care; furthermore, a recipient who
12 has experienced a failed community placement shall be transitioned back into his or her former
13 nursing home, hospital, or intermediate-care facility for persons with intellectual disabilities
14 whenever possible. Additionally, residents shall only be moved from a nursing home, hospital, or
15 intermediate-care facility for persons with intellectual disabilities in a manner consistent with
16 applicable state and federal laws.
17 (2) Any Medicaid recipient eligible for the highest level of care who voluntarily leaves a
18 nursing home, hospital, or intermediate-care facility for persons with intellectual disabilities shall
19 not be subject to any wait list for home- and community-based services.
20 (3) No nursing home, hospital, or intermediate-care facility for persons with intellectual
21 disabilities shall be denied payment for services rendered to a Medicaid recipient on the grounds
22 that the recipient does not meet level-of-care criteria unless and until the executive office has:
23 (i) Performed an individual assessment of the recipient at issue and provided written notice
24 to the nursing home, hospital, or intermediate-care facility for persons with intellectual disabilities
25 that the recipient does not meet level-of-care criteria; and
26 (ii) The recipient has either appealed that level-of-care determination and been
27 unsuccessful, or any appeal period available to the recipient regarding that level-of-care
28 determination has expired.
29 (d) The executive office is further authorized to consolidate all home- and community-
30 based services currently provided pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1396n into a single system of home- and
31 community-based services that include options for consumer direction and shared living. The
32 resulting single home- and community-based services system shall replace and supersede all 42
33 U.S.C. § 1396n programs when fully implemented. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the resulting
34 single program home- and community-based services system shall include the continued funding
Art8
RELATING TO MEDICAL ASSISTANCE
(Page -20-)

1 of assisted-living services at any assisted-living facility financed by the Rhode Island housing and
2 mortgage finance corporation prior to January 1, 2006, and shall be in accordance with chapter 66.8
3 of title 42 as long as assisted-living services are a covered Medicaid benefit.
4 (e) The executive office is authorized to promulgate rules that permit certain optional
5 services including, but not limited to, homemaker services, home modifications, respite, and
6 physical therapy evaluations to be offered to persons at risk for Medicaid-funded long-term care
7 subject to availability of state-appropriated funding for these purposes.
8 (f) To promote the expansion of home- and community-based service capacity, the
9 executive office is authorized to pursue payment methodology reforms that increase access to
10 homemaker, personal care (home health aide), assisted living, adult supportive-care homes, and
11 adult day services, as follows:
12 (1) Development of revised or new Medicaid certification standards that increase access to
13 service specialization and scheduling accommodations by using payment strategies designed to
14 achieve specific quality and health outcomes.
15 (2) Development of Medicaid certification standards for state-authorized providers of adult
16 day services, excluding providers of services authorized under § 40.1-24-1(3), assisted living, and
17 adult supportive care (as defined under chapter 17.24 of title 23) that establish for each, an acuity-
18 based, tiered service and payment methodology tied to: licensure authority; level of beneficiary
19 needs; the scope of services and supports provided; and specific quality and outcome measures.
20 The standards for adult day services for persons eligible for Medicaid-funded long-term
21 services may differ from those who do not meet the clinical/functional criteria set forth in § 40-
22 8.10-3.
23 (3) As the state’s Medicaid program seeks to assist more beneficiaries requiring long-term
24 services and supports in home- and community-based settings, the demand for home-care workers
25 has increased, and wages for these workers has not kept pace with neighboring states, leading to
26 high turnover and vacancy rates in the state’s home-care industry, the executive office shall institute
27 a one-time increase in the base-payment rates for FY 2019, as described below, for home-care
28 service providers to promote increased access to and an adequate supply of highly trained home-
29 healthcare professionals, in amount to be determined by the appropriations process, for the purpose
30 of raising wages for personal care attendants and home health aides to be implemented by such
31 providers.
32 (i) A prospective base adjustment, effective not later than July 1, 2018, of ten percent (10%)
33 of the current base rate for home-care providers, home nursing care providers, and hospice
34 providers contracted with the executive office of health and human services and its subordinate
Art8

(Page -21-)

1 agencies to deliver Medicaid fee-for-service personal care attendant services.
2 (ii) A prospective base adjustment, effective not later than July 1, 2018, of twenty percent
3 (20%) of the current base rate for home-care providers, home nursing care providers, and hospice
4 providers contracted with the executive office of health and human services and its subordinate
5 agencies to deliver Medicaid fee-for-service skilled nursing and therapeutic services and hospice
6 care.
7 (iii) Effective upon passage of this section, hospice provider reimbursement, exclusively
8 for room and board expenses for individuals residing in a skilled nursing facility, shall revert to the
9 rate methodology in effect on June 30, 2018, and these room and board expenses shall be exempted
10 from any and all annual rate increases to hospice providers as provided for in this section.
11 (iv) On the first of July in each year, beginning on July 1, 2019, the executive office of
12 health and human services will initiate an annual inflation increase to the base rate for home-care
13 providers, home nursing care providers, and hospice providers contracted with the executive office
14 and its subordinate agencies to deliver Medicaid fee-for-service personal care attendant services,
15 skilled nursing and therapeutic services and hospice care. The base rate increase shall be a
16 percentage amount equal to the New England Consumer Price Index card as determined by the
17 United States Department of Labor for medical care and for compliance with all federal and state
18 laws, regulations, and rules, and all national accreditation program requirements., except as of July
19 1, 2025, and thereafter, when no annual inflation increase shall occur for these rates.
20 (g) As the state’s Medicaid program seeks to assist more beneficiaries requiring long-term
21 services and supports in home- and community-based settings, the demand for home-care workers
22 has increased, and wages for these workers has not kept pace with neighboring states, leading to
23 high turnover and vacancy rates in the state’s home-care industry. To promote increased access to
24 and an adequate supply of direct-care workers, the executive office shall institute a payment
25 methodology change, in Medicaid fee-for-service and managed care, for FY 2022, that shall be
26 passed through directly to the direct-care workers’ wages who are employed by home nursing care
27 and home-care providers licensed by the Rhode Island department of health, as described below:
28 (1) Effective July 1, 2021, increase the existing shift differential modifier by $0.19 per
29 fifteen (15) minutes for personal care and combined personal care/homemaker.
30 (i) Employers must pass on one hundred percent (100%) of the shift differential modifier
31 increase per fifteen-minute (15) unit of service to the CNAs who rendered such services. This
32 compensation shall be provided in addition to the rate of compensation that the employee was
33 receiving as of June 30, 2021. For an employee hired after June 30, 2021, the agency shall use not
34 less than the lowest compensation paid to an employee of similar functions and duties as of June
Art8
RELATING TO MEDICAL ASSISTANCE
(Page -22-)

1 30, 2021, as the base compensation to which the increase is applied.
2 (ii) Employers must provide to EOHHS an annual compliance statement showing wages
3 as of June 30, 2021, amounts received from the increases outlined herein, and compliance with this
4 section by July 1, 2022. EOHHS may adopt any additional necessary regulations and processes to
5 oversee this subsection.
6 (2) Effective January 1, 2022, establish a new behavioral healthcare enhancement of $0.39
7 per fifteen (15) minutes for personal care, combined personal care/homemaker, and homemaker

9 includes certified nursing assistants (CNA) and homemakers) certified in behavioral healthcare
10 training.
11 (i) Employers must pass on one hundred percent (100%) of the behavioral healthcare
12 enhancement per fifteen (15) minute unit of service rendered by only those CNAs and homemakers
13 who have completed the thirty (30) hour behavioral health certificate training program offered by
14 Rhode Island College, or a training program that is prospectively determined to be compliant per
15 EOHHS, to those CNAs and homemakers. This compensation shall be provided in addition to the
16 rate of compensation that the employee was receiving as of December 31, 2021. For an employee
17 hired after December 31, 2021, the agency shall use not less than the lowest compensation paid to
18 an employee of similar functions and duties as of December 31, 2021, as the base compensation to
19 which the increase is applied.
20 (ii) By January 1, 2023, employers must provide to EOHHS an annual compliance
21 statement showing wages as of December 31, 2021, amounts received from the increases outlined
22 herein, and compliance with this section, including which behavioral healthcare training programs
23 were utilized. EOHHS may adopt any additional necessary regulations and processes to oversee
24 this subsection.
25 (h) The executive office shall implement a long-term-care-options counseling program to
26 provide individuals, or their representatives, or both, with long-term-care consultations that shall
27 include, at a minimum, information about: long-term-care options, sources, and methods of both
28 public and private payment for long-term-care services and an assessment of an individual’s
29 functional capabilities and opportunities for maximizing independence. Each individual admitted

3 the state’s health and human services departments and divisions authorized to deliver Medicaid-
4 funded home and community-based service programs, including the department of behavioral
5 healthcare, developmental disabilities and hospitals; the department of human services; and the

7 home and community-based services under this chapter, title 40.1, title 42, or any other general
8 laws to provide equitable access to conflict-free case management that shall include person-
9 centered planning, service arranging, and quality monitoring in the amount, duration, and scope
10 required by federal law and regulations. It is necessary to ensure that there is a robust network of
11 qualified conflict-free case management entities with the capacity to serve all participants on a
12 statewide basis and in a manner that promotes choice, self-reliance, and community integration.
13 The executive office, as the designated single state Medicaid authority and agency responsible for
14 coordinating policy and planning for health and human services under § 42-7.2-1 et seq., is directed
15 to establish a statewide conflict-free case management network under the management of the
16 executive office and to seek any Medicaid waivers, state plan amendments, and changes in rules,
17 regulations, and procedures that may be necessary to ensure that recipients of Medicaid home and

21 funding, and federal, Medicaid-matching funds, to pay for certain services and supports necessary
22 to transition or divert beneficiaries from institutional or restrictive settings and optimize their health
23 and safety when receiving care in a home or the community. The secretary is authorized to obtain
24 any state plan or waiver authorities required to maximize the federal funds available to support
25 expanded access to home- and community-transition and stabilization services; provided, however,
26 payments shall not exceed an annual or per-person amount.
27 (k) To ensure persons with long-term-care needs who remain living at home have adequate
28 resources to deal with housing maintenance and unanticipated housing-related costs, the secretary
29 is authorized to develop higher resource eligibility limits for persons or obtain any state plan or
30 waiver authorities necessary to change the financial eligibility criteria for long-term services and
31 supports to enable beneficiaries receiving home and community waiver services to have the
32 resources to continue living in their own homes or rental units or other home-based settings.
33 (l) The executive office shall implement, no later than January 1, 2016, the following home-

32 of a public corporation and instrumentality and agency of the state for the purpose of carrying on
33 the activities authorized by this chapter, and to vest the corporation with all of the powers, authority,
34 rights, privileges, and titles that may be necessary to enable it to accomplish these purposes. This

19 shall appoint a person to fill the vacancy, but only until the senate shall next convene and give its
20 advice and consent to a new appointment. A member shall be eligible to succeed him or herself.

22 the corporation may be removed by the governor for misfeasance, malfeasance, or willful neglect
23 of duty.

30 corporation shall impair the right of a quorum to exercise all of the rights and perform all of the
31 duties of the corporation.

22 128-8.1, 42-128-11, 42-128-13, 42-128-14 and 42-128-17 of the General Laws in Chapter 42-128
23 entitled "Rhode Island Housing Resources Act of 1998" are hereby amended to read as follows:
24 42-128-1. Findings.
25 (a) Rhode Island has an older housing stock that contributes invaluably to community
26 character, and in order to maintain the stability of neighborhoods and to sustain health communities,
27 it is necessary to have programs for housing and community development and revitalization.
28 (b) Rhode Island has an active private sector that is engaged in supplying housing.
29 (c) Rhode Island has an active nonprofit housing sector, which can, if provided adequate
30 support, assist low and moderate income persons and works to improve conditions in
31 neighborhoods and communities.
32 (d) Housing that is not adequately maintained is a source of blight in communities and a
33 cause of public health problems. Public health and safety are impaired by poor housing conditions;
34 poisoning from lead paint and respiratory disease (asthma) are significant housing-related health
Art9
RELATING TO HOUSING
(Page -15-)

1 problems in Rhode Island.
2 (e) There is an increasing need for supported living arrangements for the elderly and a
3 continuing need for supported living arrangements for persons who are disabled and/or homeless.
4 (f) Fair housing, and the potential of unequal treatment of individuals based on race,
5 ethnicity, age, disability, and family, must be given continuing attention.
6 (g) Housing costs consume a disproportionate share of income for many Rhode Islanders;
7 housing affordability is a continuing problem, especially for first-time home buyers and lower and
8 moderate income renters; the high cost of housing adversely affects the expansion of Rhode Island's
9 economy. Housing affordability and availability affect conditions of homelessness. The high cost
10 of housing and the lack of affordable, decent housing for low income households is a source of
11 hardship for very low income persons and families in Rhode Island.
12 (h) The Rhode Island housing and mortgage finance corporation, which has provided more
13 than two decades of assistance in addressing issues of both the affordability of home ownership
14 and rental housing and the preservation of the housing stock for low and moderate income persons,
15 is facing future funding shortfalls and must either increase revenues or reduce programs in order to
16 remain viable.
17 (i)(h) The federal government has been reducing its commitment to housing since 1981,
18 and there is no indication that earlier levels of federal support for housing will be restored.
19 (j)(i) Public housing authorities, which rely on federal support that is being reconsidered,
20 have been and continue to be an important housing resource for low income families and the
21 elderly.
22 (k) Rhode Island, unlike most other states, does not have an agency or department of state
23 government with comprehensive responsibility for housing.
24 (l)(j) It is necessary and desirable in order to protect that public health and to promote the
25 public welfare, to establish a housing resources agency and a housing resources commission an
26 executive office of housing and an advisory council on housing and homelessness for the purposes
27 of advising the executive office of housing on improving housing conditions, promoting housing
28 affordability, engaging in community development activities, preventing and ending homelessness,
29 and assisting the urban, suburban, and rural communities of the state.

8 42-128-8.1. Housing production and rehabilitation.
9 (a) Short title. This section shall be known and may be cited as the "Comprehensive
10 Housing Production and Rehabilitation Act of 2004."
11 (b) Findings. The general assembly finds and declares that:
12 (1) The state must maintain a comprehensive housing strategy applicable to all cities and
13 towns that addresses the housing needs of different populations including, but not limited to,
14 workers and their families who earn less than one hundred twenty percent (120%) of median
15 income, older citizens, students attending institutions of higher education, low- and very-low
16 income individuals and families, and vulnerable populations including, but not limited to, persons
17 with disabilities, homeless individuals and families, and individuals released from correctional
18 institutions.
19 (2) Efforts and programs to increase the production of housing must be sensitive to the
20 distinctive characteristics of cities and towns, neighborhoods, and areas and the need to manage
21 growth and to pace and phase development, especially in high-growth areas.
22 (3) The state in partnership with local communities must remove barriers to housing
23 development and update and maintain zoning and building regulations to facilitate the construction,
24 rehabilitation of properties and retrofitting of buildings for use as safe affordable housing.
25 (4) Creative funding mechanisms are needed at the local and state levels that provide
26 additional resources for housing development, because there is an inadequate amount of federal
27 and state subsidies to support the affordable housing needs of Rhode Island's current and projected
28 population.
29 (5) Innovative community planning tools, including, but not limited to, density bonuses
30 and permitted accessory dwelling units, are needed to offset escalating land costs and project
31 financing costs that contribute to the overall cost of housing and tend to restrict the development
32 and preservation of housing affordable to very-low income, low-income, and moderate-income
33 persons.
34 (6) The gap between the annual increase in personal income and the annual increase in the
Art9
RELATING TO HOUSING
(Page -21-)

1 median sales price of a single-family home is growing, therefore, the construction, rehabilitation
2 and maintenance of affordable, multi-family housing needs to increase to provide more rental
3 housing options to individuals and families, especially those who are unable to afford
4 homeownership of a single-family home.
5 (7) The state needs to foster the formation of cooperative partnerships between
6 communities and institutions of higher education to significantly increase the amount of residential
7 housing options for students.
8 (8) The production of housing for older citizens as well as urban populations must keep
9 pace with the next twenty-year (20) projected increases in those populations of the state.
10 (9) Efforts must be made to balance the needs of Rhode Island residents with the ability of
11 the residents of surrounding states to enter into Rhode Island's housing market with much higher
12 annual incomes at their disposal.
13 (c) Strategic plan. The commission executive office of housing, in conjunction with the
14 statewide planning program, shall develop by July 1, 2006 every five (5) years, a five-year (5)
15 strategic plan for housing, which plan shall be adopted as an element of the state guide plan, and
16 which shall include quantified goals, measurable intermediate steps toward the accomplishment of
17 the goals, implementation activities, and standards for the production and/or rehabilitation of year-
18 round housing to meet the housing needs including, but not limited to, the following:
19 (1) Older Rhode Islanders, including senior citizens, appropriate, affordable housing
20 options;
21 (2) Workers, housing affordable at their income level;
22 (3) Students, dormitory, student housing and other residential options;
23 (4) Low-income and very-low income households, rental housing;
24 (5) Persons with disabilities, appropriate housing; and
25 (6) Vulnerable individuals and families, permanent housing, single-room occupancy units,
26 transitional housing and shelters.
27 (d) As used in this section and for the purposes of the preparation of affordable housing
28 plans as specified in chapter 22.2 of title 45, words and terms shall have the meaning set forth in
29 chapter 22.2 of title 45, chapter 53 of title 45, and/or § 42-11-10, unless this section provides a
30 different meaning or unless the context indicates a different meaning or intent.

23 housing goal, and for so long as they maintain at least ten percent (10%) of their year-round housing
24 stock as low- and moderate-income housing as defined in § 45-53-3(5)(ii), and inasmuch as there
25 are provable economic impacts related to the municipalities' substantial offshore location,
26 residential housing units produced for sale in which principal, interest, taxes, which may be
27 adjusted by state and local programs for property tax relief, and insurance constitute no more than
28 thirty percent (30%) of the gross household income for a household with less than one hundred
29 forty percent (140%) of the area median income, adjusted for family size, shall be counted towards
30 the municipalities' low- and moderate-income housing inventory as defined in § 45-53-3(9).
31 (2) "Affordable housing plan" means a plan prepared and adopted by a town or city either
32 to meet the requirements of chapter 53 of title 45 or to meet the requirements of § 45-22.2-10(f),

14 (f) Upon the adoption of the strategic plan as an element of the state guide plan, towns and
15 cities shall bring their comprehensive plans into conformity with its requirements, in accordance

17 an affordable housing plan in order to comply with the provisions of chapter 53 of title 45, which
18 has been approved for consistency pursuant to § 45-22.2-9, shall be deemed to satisfy the

18 The housing resources commission shall adopt, no later than April 1, 2003, rules:
19 (1) For housing constructed prior to 1978, which require property owners to certify at the
20 time of transfer that the dwelling and/or premises meet the requirements for lead hazard mitigation
21 or lead hazard abatement, or that the party or parties acquiring the property are notified of the
22 potential lead hazards, and at the time of rental of units that the requirements for meeting the
23 appropriate standards have been met;
24 (2) For a lead hazard mitigation standard;
25 (3) For any training, certification, or licensing necessary to carry out the provisions of this
26 chapter;
27 (4) For a process to receive, investigate, and decide whether the correction of a lead hazard,
28 pursuant to § 42-128.1-8(a)(3) and (d) was satisfactory. These rules shall establish an expeditious
29 procedure to determine whether the allegation of unsatisfactory correction has merit. The process
30 may be integrated with or make use of the technical assistance service provided for in § 42-128.1-
31 13; and
32 (5) For a process to grant a variance to § 42-128.1-8(a)(3), (a)(5), and (b), where there
33 exists a hardship as to financing lead hazard mitigation, or where materials, personnel, or weather
34 delays the mitigation completion; and
Art9

15 independent clearance inspection; and (iii) Information about how to give notice of deteriorating
16 conditions;
17 (5) Correct lead hazards within thirty (30) days after notification from the tenant of a
18 dwelling unit with an at-risk occupant, or as provided for by § 34-18-22.
19 (b) New property owners of a pre-1978 rental dwelling that is occupied by an at-risk
20 occupant shall have up to sixty (60) days to meet requirements for lead hazard mitigation, if those
21 requirements were not met by the previous owner at the time of transfer, provided that the new
22 property owner has the property visually inspected within thirty (30) business days after assuming
23 ownership to determine conformity with the lead hazard control standard.
24 (c) The requirements for lead hazard mitigation shall apply to the first change in ownership
25 or tenancy after November 1, 2005; provided further, that unless requested and agreed to by an at-
26 risk occupant, meeting the lead hazard mitigation standard shall not be construed to authorize a
27 property owner to compel or cause a person, who is in tenancy on January 1, 2004, and remains in
28 tenancy continuously thereafter, to vacate a rental unit temporarily or otherwise.
29 (d) If the tenant receives no response to the notification to the property owner of

16 force.
17 42-128.1-9. Insurance coverage.
18 (a) The department of business regulation shall, by January 1, 2003, establish a uniform

22 apply to liability coverage available to property owners. The department of business regulation
23 shall have the authority and is empowered, consistent with the requirements of chapter 35 of this
24 title, to promulgate rules and regulations, which shall enable it to compile and analyze data and to
25 make determinations with regard to the availability of and rates for lead liability coverage.
26 (b) Except as otherwise provided by this chapter, no insurance company licensed or
27 permitted by the department of business regulation to provide liability coverage to rental property
28 owners shall exclude, after October 31, 2005, coverage for losses or damages caused by lead

2 for lead hazard mitigation; (ii) with the requirements of chapter 24.6 of title 23 for lead safe
3 housing, within the state of Rhode Island; or (iii) relying on a valid certificate of compliance or
4 conformance shall, effective November 1, 2005, include in the policy coverage for liability for
5 injury, damage, or death resulting from occurrences of lead poisoning in an amount equal to and
6 no less than the underlying policy limits for personal injury/bodily injury coverage provided under
7 the policy so issued to a residential rental property owner. The property owner shall, if requested
8 by the insurer, present to the insurance company, either: (1) proof of certificate of compliance of
9 an independent clearance inspection and of any affidavit of visual inspection required to maintain
10 the validity of the independent clearance inspection; (2) proof of meeting the mitigation standard
11 in the form of a clearance exam showing that lead hazards are mitigated; or (3) proof of abatement.
12 This proof shall be prima facie evidence of compliance with the requirements of this chapter. In
13 any subsequent renewal, the insurer may require any continuing proof whenever the certificate is
14 expiring, has expired, or is otherwise invalidated.
15 (d) For residential rental properties that have not been brought into compliance with the
16 requirements for lead hazard mitigation pursuant to this chapter or for lead hazard reduction
17 pursuant to chapter 24.6 of title 23 or that do not have a valid certificate of compliance or
18 conformance, effective November 1, 2005, for residential rental property owners who own or
19 owned a substantial legal or equitable interest in one property and have had no more than one un-
20 remediated dwelling unit at which a child was poisoned prior to November 1, 2005, and for
21 residential property owners who own or owned more than one property and have had no more than
22 two (2) un-remediated dwelling units at which a child was poisoned prior to November 1, 2005, an
23 insurance company, which provides liability insurance to a residential rental property owner, shall
24 either offer lead liability coverage for bodily injury, which shall be equal to the underlying limits
25 of liability coverage for the property, by endorsement, or shall assist the insured in placing lead
26 liability coverage through the program commonly known as the Rhode Island FAIR Plan either
27 directly or through one of the insurance company's agents or brokers, and the Rhode Island FAIR
28 Plan shall make available liability coverage for damages caused by lead poisoning to the class of
29 property owners described in this subsection. If the insured seeks lead liability coverage with the
30 FAIR Plan, the FAIR Plan may use reasonable underwriting guidelines, as approved by the
31 department of business regulation, to underwrite the property. Any property owner who fails to
32 remediate a property, after a notice of violation subsequent to October 31, 2005, and any property
33 that is not remediated after notice of a violation subsequent to October 31, 2005, shall not be eligible
34 to receive an offer of coverage and shall be subject to cancellation and nonrenewal of that coverage

28 SECTION 16. Section 45-24-46.1 of the General Laws in Chapter 45-24 entitled "Zoning
29 Ordinances" is hereby amended to read as follows:
30 45-24-46.1. Inclusionary zoning. [Effective January 1, 2025.]
31 (a) A zoning ordinance requiring the inclusion of affordable housing as part of a
32 development shall provide that the housing will be affordable housing, as defined in § 42-128-
33 8.1(d)(1); that the affordable housing will constitute not less than fifteen percent (15%) of the total
34 units proposed for the development; and that the units will remain affordable for a period of not
Art9
RELATING TO HOUSING
(Page -61-)

1 less than thirty (30) years from initial occupancy enforced through a land lease and/or deed
2 restriction enforceable by the municipality and the state of Rhode Island. A zoning ordinance that
3 requires the inclusion of affordable housing as part of a development shall specify the threshold in
4 which the inclusion of affordable housing is required, but in no event shall a minimum threshold
5 triggering the inclusion of affordable housing be higher than ten (10) dwelling units. The total
6 number of units for the development may include less than fifteen percent (15%) affordable units
7 after the density bonus described in subsection (c) of this section is determined.
8 (b) A zoning ordinance that includes inclusionary zoning may provide that the affordable
9 housing must be built on-site or it may allow for one or more alternative methods of production,
10 including, but not limited to: off-site construction or rehabilitation; donation of land suitable for
11 development of the required affordable units; and/or the payment of a fee in lieu of the construction
12 or provision of affordable housing units.
13 (c) Density bonus, zoning incentives, and municipal subsidies. For all projects subject
14 to inclusionary zoning, subject to applicable setback, lot width, or frontage requirements or the
15 granting of relief from the same, a municipality shall allow the addition of one market rate unit for
16 each affordable unit required and the minimum lot area per dwelling unit normally required in the
17 applicable zoning district shall be reduced by that amount necessary to accommodate the
18 development. Larger density bonuses for the provision of an increased percentage of affordable
19 housing in a development may be provided by a municipality in the zoning ordinance. The total
20 number of units for the development shall equal the number originally proposed, including the
21 required affordable units, plus the additional units that constitute the density bonus. Local
22 regulations shall provide for reasonable relief from dimensional requirements to accommodate the
23 bonus density under this section. A municipality shall provide, and an applicant may request,
24 additional zoning incentives and/or municipal government subsidies as defined in § 45-53-3 to
25 offset differential costs of affordable units. Available zoning incentives and municipal government
26 subsidies may be listed in the zoning ordinance, but shall not be an exclusive list.
27 (d) Fee-in-lieu. To the extent a municipality provides an option for the payment of a fee-
28 in-lieu of the construction or provision of affordable housing, and an application seeks to utilize
29 fee-in-lieu, the use of such fee shall be the choice of the developer or builder applied on a per-unit
30 basis and may be used for new developments, purchasing property and/or homes, rehabilitating
31 properties, or any other manner that creates additional low- or moderate-income housing as defined
32 in § 45-53-3(9).
33 (1) Eligibility for density bonus. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, an
34 application that utilizes a fee-in-lieu, off-site construction or rehabilitation, or donation of land
Art9
RELATING TO HOUSING
(Page -62-)

1 suitable for development of the required affordable units shall not be eligible for the density bonus
2 outlined in this section.
3 (2) An application that seeks to utilize a fee-in-lieu of the construction or provision of

20 and the facility’s daily census, as self-reported by the facility to the department on a quarterly basis.
21 (3) The department shall use the quarterly payroll-based journal and the self-reported
22 census to calculate the number of hours provided per resident, per day and compare this ratio to the
23 minimum staffing standards required under § 23-17.5-32. Discrepancies between job titles

6 noncompliance and establishing the variance between minimum staffing ratios and the
7 department’s computations.

9 wages and benefits for the missing staffing hours. The penalty shall increase to two hundred fifty
10 percent (250%) of the cost of wages and benefits for the missing staffing hours for the second
11 offense and three hundred percent (300%) of the cost of wages and benefits for the missing staffing
12 hours for the third and all subsequent offenses.

21 appropriate adjustments to the penalty.
22 (3) The department is granted discretion to waive the penalty when unforeseen
23 circumstances have occurred that resulted in call-offs of scheduled staff. This provision shall be
24 applied no more than two (2) times per calendar year.

26 of chapter 35 of title 42 (“administrative procedures”).
27 (d)(1) Pursuant to rules and regulations established by the department, funds that are
28 received from financial penalties shall be used for technical assistance or specialized direct care
29 staff training.

33 assessment shall be prominently posted in the nursing facility and included on the department’s

29 method as described in this chapter.
