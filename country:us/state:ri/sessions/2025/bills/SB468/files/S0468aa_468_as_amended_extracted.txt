Introduced By: Senators DiPalma, Ujifusa, and Murray
Date Introduced: February 26, 2025
Referred To: Senate Health & Human Services
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Legislative intent.
2 The purpose of this chapter is to protect the safety, health, and economic well-being of
3 Rhode Island residents by safeguarding them from the negative and harmful impact of excessive
4 and unconscionable prices for prescription drugs. In enacting this act, the legislature finds that
5 access to prescription drugs is necessary for Rhode Island residents to maintain or achieve good
6 health:
7 (i) Excessive prices negatively impact the ability of Rhode Island residents to obtain
8 prescription drugs and price increases that exceed reasonable levels thereby endanger the health
9 and safety of Rhode Island residents to maintain or achieve good health;
10 (ii) Excessive prices for prescription drugs threaten the economic well-being of Rhode
11 Island residents and endanger their ability to pay for other necessary and essential goods and
12 services including housing, food and utilities;
13 (iii) Excessive prices for prescription drugs contribute significantly to a dramatic and
14 unsustainable rise in health care costs and health insurance that threaten the overall ability of Rhode
15 Island residents to obtain health coverage and maintain or achieve good health;
16 (iv) Excessive prices for prescription drugs contribute significantly to rising state costs for
17 health care provided and paid for through health insurance programs for public employees,
18 including employees of the state, municipalities and counties, school districts, institutions of higher
19 education, and retirees whose health care costs are funded by public programs, thereby threatening
1 the ability of the state to fund those programs adequately and further threatening the ability of the
2 state to fund other programs necessary for the public good and safety, such as public education and
3 public safety; and
4 (v) Based on findings in subsections (i) through (iv) of this section, the legislature finds
5 that excessive prices for prescription drugs threaten the safety and well-being of Rhode Island
6 residents and find it is necessary to act in order to protect Rhode Island residents from the negative
7 impact of excessive costs.
