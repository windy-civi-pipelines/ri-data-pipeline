16 (c) The agency shall file the rule not later than one hundred eighty (180) days after close
17 of the public-comment period. If that rule is not filed within one hundred eighty (180) days, the
18 agency must restart the rulemaking process pursuant to this chapter.

1 (d) A final rule filed by an agency with the secretary of state under this section must contain
2 the text of the rule and be accompanied by a record that contains:
3 (1) The date the final rule was signed by the relevant agency head;
4 (2) A reference to the specific statutory or other authority authorizing the rule;
5 (3) Any finding required by law as a prerequisite to the proposed rule or effectiveness of
6 the rule;
7 (4) The effective date of the rule; and
8 (5) A concise explanatory statement as defined by § 42-35-2.6.
9 (e) Each rule hereafter shall be effective twenty (20) days after filing with the secretary of
10 state, except:
11 (1) If a later date is required by statute or specified in the rule, the later date is the effective
12 date;
13 (2) An emergency rule under § 42-35-2.10 becomes effective upon signature by the agency
14 head and the governor, or the governor’s designee;
15 (3) A direct final rule under § 42-35-2.11, to which no objection is made, becomes effective
16 thirty (30) days after publication, unless the agency specifies a later effective date;
17 (4) A final rule shall not be effective or enforceable until properly submitted and accepted
18 by the secretary of state.
19 (f) The secretary of state shall maintain a permanent register of all filed rules and concise
20 explanatory statements for the rules. The secretary of state shall provide a copy of each certified
21 final rule to an agency upon request. The secretary of state shall publish the notice of each final
22 rule in the state register.
