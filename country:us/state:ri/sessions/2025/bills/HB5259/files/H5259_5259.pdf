It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:

2 Licenses" is hereby amended by adding thereto the following section:
3 31-10-3.1. Prohibition of suspension of driving privileges.
4 (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of the general laws, no court may suspend any
5 person’s operators’ or chauffers’ license for the failure or inability to pay costs for any traffic
6 offense or the costs of any other judicial proceeding. If the person has pleaded guilty or been found
7 guilty of a traffic or other offense and the court finds, after a hearing, that the person does not have
8 the ability to pay the costs associated with those court proceedings, the court may order the offender
9 to perform community service in lieu of costs, or may order the offender to pay the costs in
10 installments according to a schedule set by the court.
11 (b) No court, department, division or any agency of this state may suspend any person’s
12 operators’ or chauffers’ license or registration of any vehicle for the failure or inability of said
13 person to pay any child support payments, tax payments, court costs or any other fees, tolls, or
14 financial obligations owing the state.
15 (c) A person’s operators’ or chauffers’ license shall only be subject to suspension for
16 convictions of driving offenses including, but not limited to, §§ 31-27-2 through 31-27-2.8 and
17 other moving violations as provided by law.
18 SECTION 2. Section 15-11.1-7 of the General Laws in Chapter 15-11.1 entitled "Full

1 Enforcement of Support Obligations" is hereby repealed.
2 15-11.1-7. Suspension by board — Notice from board.
3 (a) Upon receipt of the certification of noncompliance from the department issued in
4 accordance with § 15-11.1-6, a board shall suspend the obligor’s license and refuse to issue or
5 reissue a license until the obligor provides the board with a release from the department that states
6 the obligor is in compliance with the obligor’s support order. When an obligor who is served notice
7 under § 15-11.1-3 subsequently complies with the court order of support, the department shall
8 within five (5) business days after compliance provide the obligor with written confirmation and a
9 release that the obligor is in compliance with the order. A suspension by a board or a refusal by a
10 board to reissue, renew, or otherwise extend the license or certificate of authority shall be deemed
11 a final determination for the purposes of chapter 35 of title 42.
12 (b) A board shall notify an obligor certified by the department under § 15-11.1-6, without
13 undue delay, that the obligor’s application for the issuance or renewal of a license may not be
14 granted or that the obligor’s license has been suspended because the obligor’s name has been
15 certified by the department as a support obligor who is not in compliance with a court order of
16 support.
17 (c) Within five (5) business days of receiving written confirmation that the obligor is in
18 compliance with the court order of support, the board shall reinstate, reissue, renew or otherwise
19 extend the obligor’s license or certificate of authority.

28 to renew his/her operator’s license and/or registration has neglected or refused to file any tax returns
29 or to pay any tax administered by the tax administrator and that such tax matter is not pending

30 pay any cash assistance benefit overpayments, court costs owed, fines owed, obligations owed or

32 a written notice to such person informing him/her of the state court administrator’s intention to
33 inform the division of motor vehicles not to renew the person’s operator license and/or motor
34 vehicle registration and of the procedures available to the person to contest the determination. For

29 with which the Rhode Island turnpike and bridge authority has entered into an agreement providing
30 for the reciprocal treatment of out-of-state toll violators to take action against a toll violator, the
31 Rhode Island turnpike and bridge authority shall conduct an independent review of each toll
32 violation that forms the basis for such request, which shall include a review of photographic, video,
33 or other visual evidence, to determine that the requesting state or other entity with similar tolling
34 authority imposed any toll amounts, administrative fees, and/or fines against the actual registered

1 owner of the motor vehicle.
2 (b) As part of its independent review, the Rhode Island turnpike and bridge authority shall
3 provide written notice to the registered owner of the motor vehicle in question. The registered
4 owner shall have ten (10) days from the date on the written notice to contact the Rhode Island
5 turnpike and bridge authority and to provide information, documentation, and any other evidence
6 contesting the requested action against the out-of-state toll violator. Thereafter, the Rhode Island
7 turnpike and bridge authority shall consider all of the information, documentation, and any other
8 evidence provided as part of its independent review.
9 (c) If after its independent review the Rhode Island turnpike and bridge authority is
10 satisfied that any toll amounts, administrative fees, and/or fines are properly imposed against the
11 actual registered owner of the motor vehicle and the registered owner could be subject to reporting
12 to the division of motor vehicles pursuant to § 24-12-37 if such toll violations had occurred on
13 tolled projects in this state, the Rhode Island turnpike and bridge authority may report the registered
14 owner to the division of motor vehicles.
15 (d) The division of motor vehicles shall not renew any operator’s license or registration
16 upon expiration thereof; register any motor vehicle; or transfer the registration of any motor vehicle
17 of any person reported to it pursuant to subsection (c) of this section until any toll amounts,
18 administrative fees, and/or fines owed to the other state or other entity with similar tolling authority
19 have been paid in full or the person has entered into, and is in current compliance with, a repayment
20 agreement with respect to any amounts owed. The Rhode Island turnpike and bridge authority shall
21 provide a copy of any notification received from the other state or other entity with similar tolling
22 authority regarding full payment of amounts owed or the existence of a repayment agreement to
23 the division of motor vehicles within five (5) business days of receipt. Within five (5) business days
24 of receiving such notification, the division of motor vehicles shall renew the person’s license and
25 renew, transfer, or issue the person’s registration.

1 (4) To any person, as an operator or chauffeur, who is a habitual drunkard or habitual user
2 of drugs to such an extent that he or she is incapable of safely driving a motor vehicle;

4 examination unless that person shall have successfully passed that examination;
5 (6) To any person who is required under the laws of this state to deposit proof of financial
6 responsibility and who has not deposited that proof;
7 (7) To any person when the administrator of the division of motor vehicles has good cause
8 based on clear and convincing evidence to believe that that person does not meet a standard of
9 physical or mental fitness for motor vehicle licensure established pursuant to § 31-10-44(b) and
10 that the person’s physical or mental condition prevents him or her from being able to operate a
11 motor vehicle with safety upon the highway;
12 (8) To any person when the administrator of the division of motor vehicles has good cause
13 to believe that the operation of a motor vehicle on the highways by that person would pose an
14 imminent safety risk to the general public as determined by objectively ascertainable standards;.
15 (9) To any person who is subject to an order issued pursuant to § 14-1-67.
16 (b) The division of motor vehicles shall notify in writing any person whose application for
17 a license has been denied pursuant to subsection (a) of this section. The notice shall contain the
18 factual and legal basis for the denial, the procedure for requesting a hearing, and the rights afforded
19 the individual pursuant to the provisions of § 31-11-7(d) — (f). When physical or mental fitness is
20 the basis for the denial, the notice shall reference the specific functional standard promulgated
21 pursuant to § 31-10-44(b), which was relied upon by the division of motor vehicles. Upon his or
22 her request the division of motor vehicles shall afford the license applicant an opportunity for a
23 hearing as early as practical and no later than twenty (20) days after receipt of the request.
24 (c) The hearing procedures afforded the applicant shall conform to the provisions of § 31-
25 11-7(d) — (f).
26 SECTION 6. This act shall take effect upon passage.
