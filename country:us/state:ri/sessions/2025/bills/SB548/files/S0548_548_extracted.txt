4 portion of the premises.
5 (4) “DBR” means the department of business regulation.
6 (5) “Department” means the department of health.
7 (6) “Director” means the director of the department of health, or the director’s designee.
8 (7) “Genitals” shall mean the penis, vulva, or anus of any person or the nipples of a person
9 who identifies as female.
10 (8) “Sexual activity” means the following acts: sexual intercourse, including anal
11 intercourse; oral sex; intentional touching of another person’s genitals if it can reasonably be
12 construed as intended to be for the purpose of sexual arousal; or intentional display of genitals for
13 others to view if it can reasonably be construed as intended to be for the purpose of sexual arousal.

25 if the sexual activities permitted on the premises include sexual intercourse;
26 (5) Protocols to ensure that all sexual activity conducted on the premises be consensual;
27 (6) Protocols to reduce the risk of human trafficking; and
28 (7) Such other requirements, protocols, standards, and/or prohibitions as the director

30 (c) The department shall promulgate rules and regulations to implement the provisions of
31 this section, including penalties for violations.
32 23-104-3. License -- Violations -- Penalties.

3 promulgated by the department pursuant to the provisions of § 23-104-2.

9 (e) A local licensing authority may require that a business show cause as to why it should
10 not be required to be licensed as an adult sex venue. Should the local licensing authority determine
11 that the business is subject to licensure at a show cause hearing, the local licensing authority shall
12 order the closure of the business. Such closure order may be immediate, or the local licensing
13 authority may permit the partial or full continued operation of the business for a period of up to
14 seven (7) days to allow the business an opportunity to file an application for a license in compliance
15 with the provisions of this chapter and any applicable municipal ordinances.

32 municipality's jurisdiction.

1 chapter 37 of title 11 (sexual assault) or the enforcement or prosecution for the violation of any
2 general or special law, ordinance, rule, or regulation.
