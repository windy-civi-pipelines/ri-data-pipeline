Introduced By: Senator Alana DiMario
Date Introduced: May 29, 2025
Referred To: Placed on the Senate Consent Calendar
1 WHEREAS, It is with sadness that this Senate has learned of the passing of Dolores
2 Mary Dupré, the beloved wife of the late Robert “Bob” Dupré for sixty-five years, and the
3 cherished mother of Cynthia Wilson and her husband, Richard Gill, Judith Dupré, B.J. Dupré,
4 Susan Dupré and her partner, Jonathan Banks, and Peter Dupré; and
5 WHEREAS, Born in the City of Providence, Dolores Mary Dupré was the oldest child of
6 Benedict and Antonetta Albanese, who bestowed their children with a devotion to God, family,
7 hard work, and the importance of helping others. She is survived by her sister, Judy Gartsu, and
8 her brother, Ben Albanese and his wife, Marlene; and
9 WHEREAS, On June 24, 1949, she met her husband at Scarborough Beach and after a
10 five-year courtship, Mrs. Dupré married the love of her life, Bob, and together they created a
11 home that was warm, welcoming, and magical. She doted and celebrated every event with a
12 family gathering and adored having her grandchildren, Genevieve, Zepheryn, Chandler, and
13 Annie Dupré, Brendan and Emmet Gaffney, and Robert Wilson and Lily Benson, and their
14 partners, Spencer Lis, Emily Nalbandian, Edward Coady, and Jake, and her four great-
15 grandchildren, Serena, Ellery, and Jasper Lis, and Grace Benson around to celebrate anything and
16 everything; and
17 WHEREAS, Mrs. Dupré was a graduate of Salve Regina University, and after raising her
18 children, took a part-time job at an in-home health services company, where she rose to the
19 position of manager, and retired at the age of eighty; and

1 WHEREAS, Generous and sharing with others, but frugal with her own needs, shy and
2 private by nature, but a fierce advocate for others, Dolores Dupré left an indelible mark on all
3 who had the good fortune to be a part of her remarkable life and she is dearly missed; now,
4 therefore be it
5 RESOLVED, That this Senate of the State of Rhode Island hereby expresses deepest
6 sympathy and condolences to the family and many friends of Dolores Mary Dupré; and be it
7 further
8 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
9 transmit duly certified copies of this resolution to Cynthia Wilson and Family, Judith Dupré, B.J.
10 Dupré, Susan Dupré and Family, and Peter Dupré.
