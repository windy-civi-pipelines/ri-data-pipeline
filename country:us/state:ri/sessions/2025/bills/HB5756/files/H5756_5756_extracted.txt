28 persons and the entity owns as 90% or more of the fair market value of its assets a direct or indirect
29 interest in a real estate company. An indirect ownership interest is an interest in an entity 90% or
30 more of which is held by 35 or fewer persons and the purpose of the entity is the ownership of a
31 real estate company.
32 (g)(h) In the case of a grant, assignment, transfer, or conveyance or vesting that results in

34 or person making the conveyance or causing the vesting, shall file or cause to be filed with the
