7 to the health and human services committees of the Rhode Island house of representatives and the
8 Rhode Island senate prior to the implementation of any such recommendations and subsequently
9 shall submit a report to the general assembly by June 30, 2024. The report shall include the
10 recommendations the commissioner may implement, with supporting rationale. The workgroup
11 shall consider and make recommendations for:
12 (1) Establishing a consistent standard for electronic eligibility and coverage verification.

18 to-system basis or using a payor-supported web browser;

25 and benefits information;
26 (v) Recommend a standard or common process to protect all providers from the costs of
27 services to patients who are ineligible for insurance coverage in circumstances where a payor
28 provides eligibility verification based on best information available to the payor at the date of the
29 request of eligibility.
30 (2) Developing implementation guidelines and promoting adoption of the guidelines for:
31 (i) The use of the National Correct Coding Initiative code-edit policy by payors and

6 reconsideration of a denial of a claim that results from differences in clinical edits where no single,
7 common-standards body or process exists and multiple conflicting sources are in use by payors and
8 providers.
9 (vi) Nothing in this section, nor in the guidelines developed, shall inhibit an individual
10 payor’s ability to employ, and not disclose to providers, temporary code edits for the purpose of
11 detecting and deterring fraudulent billing activities. The guidelines shall require that each payor
12 disclose to the provider its adjudication decision on a claim that was denied or adjusted based on
13 the application of such edits and that the provider have access to the payor’s review and appeal
14 process to challenge the payor’s adjudication decision.
15 (vii) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to modify the rights or obligations of
16 payors or providers with respect to procedures relating to the investigation, reporting, appeal, or
17 prosecution under applicable law of potentially fraudulent billing activities.

22 performed or notify a payor within an appropriate standardized timeline of a patient’s admission;
23 (ii) Require payors to use common and consistent processes and time frames when
24 responding to provider requests for medical management approvals. Whenever possible, such time

33 use to request a preauthorization, including a prospective clinical necessity review; receive an
34 authorization number; and transmit an admission notification;

2 authorization requirements, based on stratification of healthcare providers’ performance and
3 adherence to evidence-based medicine with the input of contracted healthcare providers and/or
4 provider organizations. Such criteria shall be transparent and easily accessible to contracted
5 providers. Such selective prior authorization programs shall be available when healthcare providers
6 participate directly with the insurer in risk-based payment contracts and may be available to
7 providers who do not participate in risk-based contracts;
8 (vi) Require the review of medical services, including behavioral health services, and
9 prescription drugs, subject to prior authorization on at least an annual basis, with the input of

18 websites; and
19 (B) Supporting:
20 (I) Timely submission by healthcare providers of the complete information necessary to
21 make a prior authorization determination, as early in the process as possible; and
22 (II) Timely notification of prior authorization determinations by health plans to impacted
23 health plan enrollees, and healthcare providers, including, but not limited to, ordering providers,
24 and/or rendering providers, and dispensing pharmacists which may be satisfied by posting to
25 provider-accessible websites or similar electronic portals or services;
26 (viii) Increase and strengthen continuity of patient care by:
27 (A) Defining protections for continuity of care during a transition period for patients
28 undergoing an active course of treatment, when there is a formulary or treatment coverage change
29 or change of health plan that may disrupt their current course of treatment and when the treating
30 physician determines that a transition may place the patient at risk; and for prescription medication
31 by allowing a grace period of coverage to allow consideration of referred health plan options or
32 establishment of medical necessity of the current course of treatment;
33 (B) Requiring continuity of care for medical services, including behavioral health services,
34 and prescription medications for patients on appropriate, chronic, stable therapy through
LC001207/SUB B - Page 16 of 23

1 minimizing repetitive prior authorization requirements; and which for prescription medication shall
2 be allowed only on an annual review, with exception for labeled limitation, to establish continued
3 benefit of treatment; and
4 (C) Requiring communication between healthcare providers, health plans, and patients to
5 facilitate continuity of care and minimize disruptions in needed treatment which may be satisfied
6 by posting to provider-accessible websites or similar electronic portals or services;
7 (D) Continuity of care for formulary or drug coverage shall distinguish between FDA
8 designated interchangeable products and proprietary or marketed versions of a medication;
9 (ix) Encourage healthcare providers and/or provider organizations and health plans to
10 accelerate use of electronic prior authorization technology, including adoption of national standards
11 where applicable; and

18 (5) No provision of this subsection (h) shall preclude the ongoing work of the office of
