GENETIC INFORMATION PRIVACY ACT
Introduced By: Senators Zurier, Valverde, and Euer
Date Introduced: March 14, 2025
Referred To: Senate Commerce
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Legislative findings and short title.
2 (a) The general assembly finds and declares the following:
3 (1) Direct-to-consumer genetic testing services are largely unregulated and could expose
4 personal and genetic information, and potentially create unintended security consequences and
5 increased risk.
6 (2) There is growing concern in the scientific community that outside parties are exploiting
7 the use of genetic data for questionable purposes, including mass surveillance and the ability to
8 track individuals without their authorization.
9 (3) Genomic data is highly distinguishable. There is a confirmation that a sequence of 30
10 to 80 single nucleotide polymorphisms could uniquely identify an individual. Genomic data is also
11 very stable. It undergoes little change over the lifetime of an individual and thus has a long-lived
12 value, as opposed to other biometric data such as blood tests, which have expiration dates.
13 (4) The potential information hidden within genomic data is cause for significant concern.
14 As our knowledge in genomics evolves, so will our view on the sensitivity of genomic data.
15 (b) Short title. This chapter shall be known, and may be cited, as the "Genetic Information
16 Privacy Act."
17 SECTION 2. Title 6 of the General Laws entitled "COMMERCIAL LAW — GENERAL
18 REGULATORY PROVISIONS" is hereby amended by adding thereto the following chapter:
1 CHAPTER 61
2 GENETIC INFORMATION PRIVACY ACT
3 6-61-1. Definitions.
4 For purposes of this chapter, the following definitions apply:
5 (1) “Affirmative authorization” means an action that demonstrates an intentional decision
6 by the consumer.
7 (2) “Biological sample” means any material part of the human, discharge therefrom, or
8 derivative thereof, such as tissue, blood, urine, or saliva, known to contain deoxyribonucleic acid
9 (DNA).
10 (3) “Consumer” means a natural person who is a Rhode Island resident.
11 (4) “Dark pattern” means a user interface designed or manipulated with the substantial
12 effect of subverting or impairing user autonomy, decision making, or choice.
13 (5) “Direct-to-consumer genetic testing company” means an entity that does any of the
14 following:
15 (i) Sells, markets, interprets, or otherwise offers consumer-initiated genetic testing
16 products or services directly to consumers.
17 (ii) Analyzes genetic data obtained from a consumer, except to the extent that the analysis
18 is performed by a person licensed in the healing arts for diagnosis or treatment of a medical
19 condition.
20 (iii) Collects, uses, maintains, or discloses genetic data collected or derived from a direct-
21 to-consumer genetic testing product or service, or is directly provided by a consumer.
22 (6) “Express consent” means a consumer’s affirmative authorization to grant permission in
23 response to a clear, meaningful, and prominent notice regarding the collection, use, maintenance,
24 or disclosure of genetic data for a specific purpose. The nature of the data collection, use,
25 maintenance, or disclosure shall be conveyed in clear and prominent terms in such a manner that
26 an ordinary consumer would notice and understand it. Express consent cannot be inferred from
27 inaction. Agreement obtained through use of dark patterns does not constitute consent.
28 (7)(i) “Genetic data” means any data, regardless of its format, that results from the analysis
29 of a biological sample from a consumer, or from another element enabling equivalent information
30 to be obtained, and concerns genetic material. Genetic material includes, but is not limited to,

4 of the following:
5 (A) Takes reasonable measures to ensure that the information cannot be associated with a
6 consumer or household;
7 (B) Publicly commits to maintain and use the information only in deidentified form and
8 not to attempt to reidentify the information, except that the business may attempt to reidentify the
9 information solely for the purpose of determining whether its deidentification processes satisfy the
10 requirements of this subsection; provided that, the business does not use or disclose any information
11 reidentified in this process and destroys the reidentified information upon completion of that
12 assessment; and
13 (C) Contractually obligates any recipients of the information to take reasonable measures
14 to ensure that the information cannot be associated with a consumer or household and to commit
15 to maintaining and using the information only in deidentified form and not to reidentify the
