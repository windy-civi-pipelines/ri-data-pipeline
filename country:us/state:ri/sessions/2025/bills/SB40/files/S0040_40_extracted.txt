RELATING TO TAXATION -- PERSONAL INCOME TAX
Date Introduced: January 23, 2025
Referred To: Senate Finance
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Section 44-30-2.6 of the General Laws in Chapter 44-30 entitled "Personal
2 Income Tax" is hereby amended to read as follows:
3 44-30-2.6. Rhode Island taxable income — Rate of tax.
4 (a) “Rhode Island taxable income” means federal taxable income as determined under the
5 Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., not including the increase in the basic, standard-
6 deduction amount for married couples filing joint returns as provided in the Jobs and Growth Tax
7 Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 and the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of
8 2001 (EGTRRA), and as modified by the modifications in § 44-30-12.
9 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of §§ 44-30-1 and 44-30-2, for tax years beginning on
10 or after January 1, 2001, a Rhode Island personal income tax is imposed upon the Rhode Island
11 taxable income of residents and nonresidents, including estates and trusts, at the rate of twenty-five
12 and one-half percent (25.5%) for tax year 2001, and twenty-five percent (25%) for tax year 2002
13 and thereafter of the federal income tax rates, including capital gains rates and any other special
14 rates for other types of income, except as provided in § 44-30-2.7, which were in effect immediately
15 prior to enactment of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA);
16 provided, rate schedules shall be adjusted for inflation by the tax administrator beginning in taxable
17 year 2002 and thereafter in the manner prescribed for adjustment by the commissioner of Internal
18 Revenue in 26 U.S.C. § 1(f). However, for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2006, a
19 taxpayer may elect to use the alternative flat tax rate provided in § 44-30-2.10 to calculate his or
1 her personal income tax liability.
2 (c) For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2001, if a taxpayer has an alternative
3 minimum tax for federal tax purposes, the taxpayer shall determine if he or she has a Rhode Island
4 alternative minimum tax. The Rhode Island alternative minimum tax shall be computed by
5 multiplying the federal tentative minimum tax without allowing for the increased exemptions under
6 the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (as redetermined on federal form 6251
7 Alternative Minimum Tax-Individuals) by twenty-five and one-half percent (25.5%) for tax year
8 2001, and twenty-five percent (25%) for tax year 2002 and thereafter, and comparing the product
9 to the Rhode Island tax as computed otherwise under this section. The excess shall be the taxpayer’s
10 Rhode Island alternative minimum tax.
11 (1) For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2005, and thereafter, the exemption
12 amount for alternative minimum tax, for Rhode Island purposes, shall be adjusted for inflation by
13 the tax administrator in the manner prescribed for adjustment by the commissioner of Internal
14 Revenue in 26 U.S.C. § 1(f).
15 (2) For the period January 1, 2007, through December 31, 2007, and thereafter, Rhode
16 Island taxable income shall be determined by deducting from federal adjusted gross income as
17 defined in 26 U.S.C. § 62 as modified by the modifications in § 44-30-12 the Rhode Island
18 itemized-deduction amount and the Rhode Island exemption amount as determined in this section.

28 Identification Number must be provided on the Rhode Island tax return for the purpose of claiming
29 said exemption(s).
30 (D) In the case of any taxpayer whose adjusted gross income, as modified for Rhode Island
31 purposes pursuant to § 44-30-12, for the taxable year exceeds one hundred seventy-five thousand
32 dollars ($175,000), the exemption amount shall be reduced by the applicable percentage. The term

LC000230 - Page 13 of 16

7 (II) The cost-of-living adjustment with a base year of 2000.
8 (III) For the purposes of this section, the cost-of-living adjustment for any calendar year is
9 the percentage (if any) by which the consumer price index for the preceding calendar year exceeds
10 the consumer price index for the base year. The consumer price index for any calendar year is the
11 average of the consumer price index as of the close of the twelve-month (12) period ending on
12 August 31, of such calendar year.
13 (IV) For the purpose of this section the term “consumer price index” means the last
14 consumer price index for all urban consumers published by the department of labor. For the purpose
15 of this section the revision of the consumer price index that is most consistent with the consumer
16 price index for calendar year 1986 shall be used.
17 (V) If any increase determined under this section is not a multiple of fifty dollars ($50.00),
18 such increase shall be rounded to the next lower multiple of fifty dollars ($50.00). In the case of a
19 married individual filing separate return, if any increase determined under this section is not a
20 multiple of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), such increase shall be rounded to the next lower multiple
21 of twenty-five dollars ($25.00).

IN GENERAL ASSEMBLY
JANUARY SESSION, A.D. 2025
____________
A N A C T
RELATING TO TAXATION -- PERSONAL INCOME TAX
Introduced By: Senators Felag, Murray, Mack, Britto, Sosnowski, and Ciccone
Date Introduced: January 23, 2025
Referred To: Senate Finance
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Section 44-30-2.6 of the General Laws in Chapter 44-30 entitled "Personal
2 Income Tax" is hereby amended to read as follows:
3 44-30-2.6. Rhode Island taxable income — Rate of tax.
4 (a) “Rhode Island taxable income” means federal taxable income as determined under the
5 Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., not including the increase in the basic, standard-
6 deduction amount for married couples filing joint returns as provided in the Jobs and Growth Tax
7 Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 and the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of
8 2001 (EGTRRA), and as modified by the modifications in § 44-30-12.
9 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of §§ 44-30-1 and 44-30-2, for tax years beginning on
10 or after January 1, 2001, a Rhode Island personal income tax is imposed upon the Rhode Island
11 taxable income of residents and nonresidents, including estates and trusts, at the rate of twenty-five
12 and one-half percent (25.5%) for tax year 2001, and twenty-five percent (25%) for tax year 2002
13 and thereafter of the federal income tax rates, including capital gains rates and any other special
14 rates for other types of income, except as provided in § 44-30-2.7, which were in effect immediately
15 prior to enactment of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA);
16 provided, rate schedules shall be adjusted for inflation by the tax administrator beginning in taxable
17 year 2002 and thereafter in the manner prescribed for adjustment by the commissioner of Internal
18 Revenue in 26 U.S.C. § 1(f). However, for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2006, a
19 taxpayer may elect to use the alternative flat tax rate provided in § 44-30-2.10 to calculate his or

1 her personal income tax liability.
2 (c) For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2001, if a taxpayer has an alternative
3 minimum tax for federal tax purposes, the taxpayer shall determine if he or she has a Rhode Island
4 alternative minimum tax. The Rhode Island alternative minimum tax shall be computed by
5 multiplying the federal tentative minimum tax without allowing for the increased exemptions under
6 the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (as redetermined on federal form 6251
7 Alternative Minimum Tax-Individuals) by twenty-five and one-half percent (25.5%) for tax year
8 2001, and twenty-five percent (25%) for tax year 2002 and thereafter, and comparing the product
9 to the Rhode Island tax as computed otherwise under this section. The excess shall be the taxpayer’s
10 Rhode Island alternative minimum tax.
11 (1) For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2005, and thereafter, the exemption
12 amount for alternative minimum tax, for Rhode Island purposes, shall be adjusted for inflation by
13 the tax administrator in the manner prescribed for adjustment by the commissioner of Internal
14 Revenue in 26 U.S.C. § 1(f).
15 (2) For the period January 1, 2007, through December 31, 2007, and thereafter, Rhode
16 Island taxable income shall be determined by deducting from federal adjusted gross income as
17 defined in 26 U.S.C. § 62 as modified by the modifications in § 44-30-12 the Rhode Island
18 itemized-deduction amount and the Rhode Island exemption amount as determined in this section.
