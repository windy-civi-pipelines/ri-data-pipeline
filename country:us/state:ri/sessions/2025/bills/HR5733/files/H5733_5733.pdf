1 WHEREAS, According to the Federal Bureau of Indian Affairs, under the Department of

3 granted to its indigenous tribes; now, therefore be it
4 RESOLVED, That this General Assembly of the State of Rhode Island hereby officially
5 recognizes the Seaconke Wampanoag tribe as a Native American Indian tribe for the limited
6 purpose of assisting this tribe in establishing eligibility for federal education, job training, and

8 grants for which Indian tribes or groups, or members thereof, may be eligible; protecting the
9 ability of this tribe and their members to engage in traditional religious practices and ceremonies;
10 preserving and protecting burial sites and artifacts; and ensuring that handicrafts made by tribal
11 members may be sold as "Indian made"; and be it further
12 RESOLVED, That this General Assembly hereby further states that this resolution shall
13 not confer recognition for any purpose except as expressly stated herein, and shall not be
14 evidence that the tribe has a State compact or State approval for the purposes of the federal Indian
15 Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C. ch. 29 ยง 2701 et seq.; and be it further
16 RESOLVED, That this General Assembly hereby further states that the limited State
17 recognition accorded to this tribe shall not be construed to affect in any way a tribe's or group's
18 case for federal recognition, shall not confer the right of any tribe, group or individual to conduct
19 gambling of any kind or to engage in the sale of motor fuels or tobacco and shall not constitute an

1 acknowledgement of any claim by any tribe, group, or individual to any ancestral, tribal or other
2 public or private lands; and be it further

4 transmit a duly certified copy of this resolution to the Honorable Daniel McKee, Governor of the
