5 (4) The Rhode Island state police or deputies shall investigate reports of SRM or radiation
6 pollution to ensure compliance with the requirements of this chapter or the administrative
7 regulations promulgated hereunder.
8 23-23.8-7. Investigatory findings -- Responses.
9 As established in this chapter, scientific dimensions of SRM include the use of
10 interoperable ground-based, airborne, and space-based facilities involving the release of pollutants,
11 including radiation. There are ever-increasing numbers of pollution-generating, microwave-
12 irradiating instruments used in weather experimentation including, but not limited to, ground-based
13 facilities interoperable with drones and satellites. Such infrastructures and the electrical grid are
14 vulnerable to radiation pollution interference, EMP events and cyber-attacks, potentially leading to
15 accidents, fatalities, damage to critical infrastructures, possible collapse of commerce systems and
16 the failure of essential public utilities, costing the state billions of dollars. Therefore, irradiating
17 infrastructure shall be subject to evaluation by an independent licensed radiofrequency (RF)
18 engineer paid for by the facility owner. RF engineer shall provide findings in a report to be
19 submitted to the Rhode Island state police, therefore:
20 (1) Radiation signal strength metered at the reported location is not to exceed -75 dBm
21 (decibel-milliwatt) for any frequency or channel band specified by a transmitting entity’s FCC
22 transmission license; or, maximum power output limit from all frequencies/antennas from a
23 wireless facility is not to exceed 0.1 watt of effective radiated power (ERP) so as to provide -75
24 dBm signal strength at 1/2 mile, or five (5) bars on a cell phone. If signal strength metered by RF
25 engineer is in excess of -75 dBm (decibel-milliwatt), the facility operator has thirty (30) days to
26 achieve compliance without disruption to performance of personal wireless services. The Rhode
27 Island state police or deputies shall perform random testing from time to time to ensure facility
28 compliance with this chapter. Failure to comply will result in a fine of not less than five hundred
29 thousand dollars ($500,000) per day for each day the facility is out of compliance. Deliberate
30 falsification or altering of information shall be punished in accordance with § 23-23.8-6(1) and (2).
31 All public and private entities operating in the state shall comply with these guidelines.
32 (2) To reduce pollution and ensure the economic protection and privacy of Rhode Islanders,
33 the safe and secure deployment of hardwired, fiber-optic connections to the premises (FTTP) to
34 homes, schools, and businesses shall be required, thereby providing the ability to conduct financial
LC000763 - Page 6 of 9
1 transactions and complete lifesaving communications in the event that electronic interactions by
2 existing means are compromised, hacked, restricted, or not possible. To safeguard the wellbeing of
3 Rhode Islanders, consumer choice options, including non-wireless routers, non-wireless modems,
4 and non-wireless mechanical analog utility meters, within home, property, or business shall be
5 offered to customers without additional fees.
6 SECTION 3. Section 30-15-7 of the General Laws in Chapter 30-15 entitled "Emergency
7 Management" is hereby amended to read as follows:
8 30-15-7. Governor’s general powers.
9 The governor shall be responsible for carrying out the provisions of this chapter and shall
10 be primarily responsible for emergency management in the state. Aside from powers granted to the
11 governor elsewhere, the governor is hereby specifically authorized to:
12 (1) Issue executive orders, proclamations, and regulations and amend or rescind them.
13 Executive orders, proclamations, and regulations, for the purposes of this chapter, have the force
14 and effect of law;
15 (2) Cooperate with the federal authorities and with the governors and/or officials of the
16 other states in matters pertaining to the common disaster preparedness of the states and nation, and
17 in exercising the powers under this chapter, the governor shall avoid duplications of, and conflicts
18 with, the efforts of the federal authorities acting within their proper spheres;
19 (3) Consider on a continuing basis steps that could be taken to prevent or reduce the harmful
20 consequences of disasters. At the governor’s direction, and pursuant to any other authority they
21 now have, state agencies, including, but not limited to, those that are or may be charged with
22 responsibilities in connection with flood plain management, stream encroachment and flow
23 regulation, weather modification, fire prevention and control, air quality, public works, land use
24 and land-use planning, and construction standards, shall make studies of disaster-prevention-related
25 matters. The governor, from time to time, shall make recommendations to the general assembly,
26 local governments, and other appropriate public and private entities as may facilitate measures for
27 mitigation of the harmful consequences of disasters;
28 (4) Prepare a comprehensive plan and program for disasters (including response and
29 recovery) in the state, the plan and program to be integrated into, and coordinated with, the response
30 and disaster plans of other states to the fullest possible extent, and coordinate the preparation of
31 plans and programs for disasters by the political subdivisions of the state, such plans to be integrated
32 into, and coordinated with the state disaster plan and program to the fullest possible extent;
33 (5) In accordance with the plans and programs for disasters in the state, procure supplies
34 and equipment, to institute training programs and public information programs, and to take all other
LC000763 - Page 7 of 9
1 preparatory steps, including the partial or full mobilization of disaster organizations in advance of
2 actual disaster, to ensure the furnishing of adequately trained and equipped forces of disaster
3 personnel in time of need;
4 (6) Delegate any administrative authority vested in the governor under this chapter and
5 provide for the subsequent delegation of that authority; and
6 (7) Do all other things necessary to ensure adequate preparation for disasters in the state,
7 not inconsistent with other provisions of law.
8 SECTION 4. This act shall take effect upon passage.

1 artificial changes in the composition, behavior, or dynamics of the atmosphere.
2 23-23.8-3. Regulation by the state.
3 (a) Government and armed forces projects shall meet all the requirements of this chapter.
4 If an activity deemed a hazard by this chapter has been approved, explicitly or implicitly, by the
5 federal government, the Rhode Island state police (RISP) shall issue a notice to the appropriate
6 federal agency that the activity cannot lawfully be carried out within or over the state.
7 (b) RISP is authorized to and shall implement this chapter, determining when violations
8 have occurred and if deemed necessary shall refer potentially violative activity to the Rhode Island
9 air national guard.
10 23-23.8-4. Violative activity - Prohibition on solar radiation modification (SRM),
11 sunlight reflection methods (SRM), solar radiation management (SRM), cloud seeding,
12 weather modification, or other polluting atmospheric experiments and/or interventions.
13 (a) No person or entity shall engage in SRM or other polluting atmospheric
14 experimentation and/or interventions in this state, including through the use of an aircraft, balloon,
15 space-based platform, ground generators, or interoperable ground-based facility.
16 (b) The state police shall immediately issue and publicly report a cease-and-desist order,
17 when an unlawful polluting atmospheric activity is suspected. The cease-and-desist order under
18 this section shall have the weight of a court order and any violation shall be punished in accordance
19 with § 23-23.8-6.
20 23-23.8-5. Departmental notice to cease federal or foreign-approved programs.
21 (a) Where an activity deemed hazardous by this chapter has been approved, explicitly or
22 implicitly, by the federal government or a government agency, the state police shall issue a notice
23 to the appropriate federal authority, agency, entity, or academic institution that the polluting
24 intervention cannot lawfully be carried out within or over the State of Rhode Island.
25 (b) Government agencies or projects, academic institutions, public or private entities, and
26 armed forces operating within or above the State of Rhode Island shall meet all the requirements

30 under this chapter or person who uses an unmarked or unidentified aircraft or other vehicle or
31 facility to carry out an experiment and/or intervention involving the release of pollutants, or who
32 fails to comply with the regulations set forth:
33 (1) Has committed a felony and shall pay a fine of not less than five hundred thousand
34 dollars ($500,000) or be imprisoned for not less than five (5) years, or both;
LC000763 - Page 5 of 9

1 (2) Shall be guilty of a separate offense for each day during which violative activity has
2 been conducted, repeated, or continued;
3 (3) Rhode Island state police shall deputize and train volunteer Rhode Island citizens to
4 assist with the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.
5 (4) The Rhode Island state police or deputies shall investigate reports of SRM or radiation
6 pollution to ensure compliance with the requirements of this chapter or the administrative
7 regulations promulgated hereunder.
8 23-23.8-7. Investigatory findings -- Responses.
9 As established in this chapter, scientific dimensions of SRM include the use of
10 interoperable ground-based, airborne, and space-based facilities involving the release of pollutants,
11 including radiation. There are ever-increasing numbers of pollution-generating, microwave-
12 irradiating instruments used in weather experimentation including, but not limited to, ground-based
13 facilities interoperable with drones and satellites. Such infrastructures and the electrical grid are
14 vulnerable to radiation pollution interference, EMP events and cyber-attacks, potentially leading to
15 accidents, fatalities, damage to critical infrastructures, possible collapse of commerce systems and
16 the failure of essential public utilities, costing the state billions of dollars. Therefore, irradiating
17 infrastructure shall be subject to evaluation by an independent licensed radiofrequency (RF)
18 engineer paid for by the facility owner. RF engineer shall provide findings in a report to be
19 submitted to the Rhode Island state police, therefore:
20 (1) Radiation signal strength metered at the reported location is not to exceed -75 dBm
21 (decibel-milliwatt) for any frequency or channel band specified by a transmitting entity’s FCC
22 transmission license; or, maximum power output limit from all frequencies/antennas from a
23 wireless facility is not to exceed 0.1 watt of effective radiated power (ERP) so as to provide -75
24 dBm signal strength at 1/2 mile, or five (5) bars on a cell phone. If signal strength metered by RF
25 engineer is in excess of -75 dBm (decibel-milliwatt), the facility operator has thirty (30) days to
26 achieve compliance without disruption to performance of personal wireless services. The Rhode
27 Island state police or deputies shall perform random testing from time to time to ensure facility
28 compliance with this chapter. Failure to comply will result in a fine of not less than five hundred
29 thousand dollars ($500,000) per day for each day the facility is out of compliance. Deliberate
30 falsification or altering of information shall be punished in accordance with § 23-23.8-6(1) and (2).
31 All public and private entities operating in the state shall comply with these guidelines.
32 (2) To reduce pollution and ensure the economic protection and privacy of Rhode Islanders,
33 the safe and secure deployment of hardwired, fiber-optic connections to the premises (FTTP) to
34 homes, schools, and businesses shall be required, thereby providing the ability to conduct financial
LC000763 - Page 6 of 9

1 transactions and complete lifesaving communications in the event that electronic interactions by
2 existing means are compromised, hacked, restricted, or not possible. To safeguard the wellbeing of
3 Rhode Islanders, consumer choice options, including non-wireless routers, non-wireless modems,
4 and non-wireless mechanical analog utility meters, within home, property, or business shall be
5 offered to customers without additional fees.
6 SECTION 3. Section 30-15-7 of the General Laws in Chapter 30-15 entitled "Emergency
7 Management" is hereby amended to read as follows:
8 30-15-7. Governor’s general powers.
9 The governor shall be responsible for carrying out the provisions of this chapter and shall
10 be primarily responsible for emergency management in the state. Aside from powers granted to the
11 governor elsewhere, the governor is hereby specifically authorized to:
12 (1) Issue executive orders, proclamations, and regulations and amend or rescind them.
13 Executive orders, proclamations, and regulations, for the purposes of this chapter, have the force
14 and effect of law;
15 (2) Cooperate with the federal authorities and with the governors and/or officials of the
16 other states in matters pertaining to the common disaster preparedness of the states and nation, and
17 in exercising the powers under this chapter, the governor shall avoid duplications of, and conflicts
18 with, the efforts of the federal authorities acting within their proper spheres;
19 (3) Consider on a continuing basis steps that could be taken to prevent or reduce the harmful
20 consequences of disasters. At the governor’s direction, and pursuant to any other authority they
21 now have, state agencies, including, but not limited to, those that are or may be charged with
22 responsibilities in connection with flood plain management, stream encroachment and flow
23 regulation, weather modification, fire prevention and control, air quality, public works, land use
24 and land-use planning, and construction standards, shall make studies of disaster-prevention-related
25 matters. The governor, from time to time, shall make recommendations to the general assembly,
26 local governments, and other appropriate public and private entities as may facilitate measures for
27 mitigation of the harmful consequences of disasters;
28 (4) Prepare a comprehensive plan and program for disasters (including response and
29 recovery) in the state, the plan and program to be integrated into, and coordinated with, the response
30 and disaster plans of other states to the fullest possible extent, and coordinate the preparation of
31 plans and programs for disasters by the political subdivisions of the state, such plans to be integrated
32 into, and coordinated with the state disaster plan and program to the fullest possible extent;
33 (5) In accordance with the plans and programs for disasters in the state, procure supplies
34 and equipment, to institute training programs and public information programs, and to take all other
LC000763 - Page 7 of 9

1 preparatory steps, including the partial or full mobilization of disaster organizations in advance of
2 actual disaster, to ensure the furnishing of adequately trained and equipped forces of disaster
3 personnel in time of need;
4 (6) Delegate any administrative authority vested in the governor under this chapter and
5 provide for the subsequent delegation of that authority; and
6 (7) Do all other things necessary to ensure adequate preparation for disasters in the state,
7 not inconsistent with other provisions of law.
8 SECTION 4. This act shall take effect upon passage.
