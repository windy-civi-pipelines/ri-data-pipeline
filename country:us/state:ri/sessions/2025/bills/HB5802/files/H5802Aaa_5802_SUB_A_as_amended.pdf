3 45-22.2-10. Coordination of state agencies.
4 (a) State agencies shall develop their respective programs and conduct their respective
5 activities in a manner consistent with the findings, intent, and goals established under this chapter.
6 (b) The chief shall develop standards to assist municipalities in the incorporation of the
7 state goals and policies into comprehensive plans, and to guide the chief’s review of comprehensive
8 plans and state agency activities.
9 (c) The state planning council shall adopt and maintain all rules and regulations necessary
10 to implement the standards established by this chapter.
11 (d) The chief shall develop and make readily available to all municipalities statewide data
12 and technical information for use in the preparation of comprehensive plans. Data specific to each
13 municipality shall be provided by that municipality. The chief shall make maximum use of existing
14 information available from other agencies.
15 (e) The chief may contract with any person, firm, or corporation to develop the necessary
16 planning information and coordinate with other state agencies as necessary to provide support and
17 technical assistance for local planning efforts.
18 (f) The chief shall notify appropriate state agencies of the approval of a comprehensive

1 plan or amendment to a comprehensive plan.
2 (g) Programs and projects of state agencies excluding those residential projects to which
3 the process in subsection (h)(1) of this section applies. Once a municipality’s comprehensive plan
4 is approved, programs and projects of state agencies, excluding the state guide plan as provided for
5 by § 42-11-10, shall conform to that plan. In the event that a state agency wishes to undertake a
6 program, project, or to develop a facility which is not in conformance with the comprehensive plan,
7 the state planning council shall hold a public hearing on the proposal at which the state agency must
8 demonstrate:
9 (1) That the program, project, or facility conforms to the stated goals, findings, and intent
10 of this chapter; and
11 (2) That the program, project, or facility is needed to promote or protect the health, safety,
12 and welfare of the people of Rhode Island; and
13 (3) That the program, project, or facility is in conformance with the relevant sections of the
14 state guide plan; and
15 (4) That the program implementation, project, or size, scope, and design of the facility will
16 vary as little as possible from the comprehensive plan of the municipality.
17 (h)(1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, in the event a state agency
18 wishes to undertake a program, project or to develop a facility on state-owned vacant land, state-
19 owned abandoned property, or state-owned underutilized or excess land, for housing purposes,
20 which is not in conformance with an approved and updated local comprehensive plan, and/or local
21 zoning ordinance provisions, then the state planning council shall hold a public hearing on the
22 proposal within sixty (60) days of receipt of the proposal, providing at least fourteen (14) days'
23 notice of the hearing to the municipality in which the property is located, where the state agency
24 must demonstrate:
25 (i) That the program, project, or facility conforms to relevant sections of the state guide
26 plan prepared and adopted pursuant to § 42-11-10; and
27 (ii) That the program, project, or facility is needed to promote or protect the health, safety,
28 and welfare of the people of Rhode Island including, but not limited to, the need for housing,
29 including low- and moderate-income housing; and
30 (iii) That the program, project, or facility has attempted to utilize design standards and
31 recommendations of the relevant municipality to the extent feasible; and
32 (iv) That the agency has obtained reports from experts which conclude that there will not
33 be a detrimental impact on traffic, stormwater, wetlands, sewer capacity, potable water availability,
34 or historic features; and

4 or transferring, leasing or selling the property upon completion of the project, to any nonprofit, or
5 privately-owned entity or person under any approved and lawful process.
