9 (b) Reduce any sum or sums of money appropriated in the bill while approving other
10 portions of the bill, in which case the portions of the bill so approved by the governor shall also
11 become law unless the general assembly repasses the original sum or sums according to the rules
12 and limitations prescribed in this section for the passage of other bills over the governor's veto;
13 provided that, each sum of money so reduced by the governor shall be separately and individually
14 reconsidered by the general assembly; or
15 (c) Disapprove one or more items or parts of items of the bill (other than sum or sums of
16 money described in the immediately preceding subsection (b) of this section), in which case any
17 portions of the bill so disapproved by the governor shall not become law unless the general

19 limitations prescribed in this section for the passage of other bills over the governor's veto,
20 provided:

5 be published as a part of this resolution in the newspapers of the state prior to the date of the said
6 meetings of the said electors; and the said proposition shall be inserted in the warrants or notices
