3 (c) Any charitable organization registered pursuant to § 5-53.1-2 that is the parent

7 (d) As used in this section, the term “affiliate” includes any chapter, branch, auxiliary, or

10 (e) There shall be appended to each combined report a schedule, containing the information
11 that may be prescribed by the director reflecting the activities of each affiliate, that shall contain a
12 certification, under penalty of perjury, by an official of the organization, certifying that the
13 information contained therein is true.
14 (f) The failure of a parent organization to file an appropriate combined, written report shall
15 not excuse either the parent organization or its affiliates from complying with the provisions of
16 subsection (a) of this section.
17 (g) A combined report filed pursuant to this section shall be accompanied by a fee of
18 seventy-five dollars ($75.00) plus seventy-five dollars ($75.00) for each organization included in

21 charitable organization with any other governmental agency in compliance with the provisions of

24 (i) The due date on which to submit financial information (IRS Form 990 or audited annual
25 financial statements) shall initially be extended until the IRS due date, and then until the IRS
26 extension dates, as necessary. For the initial request, the registrant shall submit to the department
27 an extension request letter with the annual registration form stating the IRS due date. For any further
28 extensions, the registrant shall submit an additional letter or a copy of the IRS request for an
29 extension form. The extensions apply to Form 990, the annual audited financial statement, and any
