7 of warmth, family, and togetherness to all who passed through their doors; and
8 WHEREAS, In 2002, Joe Marzilli was honored as a "Culinary Legend" by Johnson &

11 menu; and
12 WHEREAS, Throughout the years, hundreds of national and state celebrities and
13 thousands of local citizens and officials dined and gathered at the Old Canteen; and

18 joins countless admirers and classic Italian foodies in thanking the Marzilli Family for almost

1 wishing them the best in all their future endeavors; and be it further
2 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
3 transmit a duly certified copy of this resolution to Sal Marzilli and Family.
