6 No person shall be employed to teach, as principal or assistant, in any school supported
7 wholly or in part by public money unless the person shall have a certificate of qualification issued
8 by or under the authority of the board of regents for elementary and secondary education. Provided,

15 cause to be paid any of the public money to any person for teaching who did not, at the time of
16 teaching, hold a certificate, then the department of elementary and secondary education shall deduct
17 a sum equal to the amount so paid from the amount of the state’s money due, or which may
18 thereafter become due, to the city or town, before giving his or her order in favor of the city or town
19 for any of the public money under the provisions of §§ 16-1-10, 16-1-11, and 16-5-22.
