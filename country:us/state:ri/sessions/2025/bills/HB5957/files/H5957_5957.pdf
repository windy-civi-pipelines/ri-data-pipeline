34 property secured with a federal government rental assistance voucher that does not otherwise meet
LC001943 - Page 3 of 5

1 the other requirements to qualify as low- or moderate-income housing under this section shall be
2 counted as one whole unit toward the municipality’s requirement for low- or moderate-income
3 housing, as long as a municipality confirms with the issuing authority that the voucher is in good
4 standing and active.
5 (10) “Meeting local housing needs” means as a result of the adoption of the implementation
