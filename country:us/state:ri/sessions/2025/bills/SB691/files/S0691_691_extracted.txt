4 also change the definitions of infertility and standard fertility-preservation services as they
5 currently exist in chapters 27-18, 27-19, 27-20 and 27-41. The act would further remove the one
6 hundred thousand dollar ($100,000) lifetime cap on coverage for these services.
7 This act would apply to health plans that are entered into, amended, extended, or renewed
8 on or after January 1, 2026.

EXPLANATION
BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL
OF
A N A C T
RELATING TO INSURANCE -- ACCIDENT AND SICKNESS INSURANCE POLICIES
***
1 This act would require individual and group health insurance policies that provide
2 pregnancy-related benefits to cover medically necessary expenses for diagnosis and treatment of
3 infertility and standard fertility-preservation services regardless of the insured’s age. This act would
4 also change the definitions of infertility and standard fertility-preservation services as they
5 currently exist in chapters 27-18, 27-19, 27-20 and 27-41. The act would further remove the one
6 hundred thousand dollar ($100,000) lifetime cap on coverage for these services.
7 This act would apply to health plans that are entered into, amended, extended, or renewed
8 on or after January 1, 2026.
