It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Sections 31-27-2, 31-27-2.1 and 31-27-2.8 of the General Laws in Chapter
2 31-27 entitled "Motor Vehicle Offenses" are hereby amended to read as follows:
3 31-27-2. Driving under influence of liquor or drugs. [Effective July 1, 2025.]
4 (a) Whoever drives or otherwise operates any vehicle in the state while under the influence
5 of any intoxicating liquor, drugs, toluene, or any controlled substance as defined in chapter 28 of
6 title 21, or any combination of these, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, except as provided in
7 subsection (d)(3), and shall be punished as provided in subsection (d) of this section.
8 (b)(1) Any person charged under subsection (a), whose blood alcohol concentration is eight
9 one-hundredths of one percent (.08%) or more by weight, as shown by a chemical analysis of a
10 blood, breath, or urine sample, shall be guilty of violating subsection (a). This provision shall not
11 preclude a conviction based on other admissible evidence, including the testimony of a drug
12 recognition expert or evaluator, certified pursuant to training approved by the Rhode Island
13 department of transportation office on highway safety. Proof of guilt under this section may also
14 be based on evidence that the person charged was under the influence of intoxicating liquor, drugs,
15 toluene, or any controlled substance defined in chapter 28 of title 21, or any combination of these,
16 to a degree that rendered the person incapable of safely operating a vehicle. The fact that any person
17 charged with violating this section is, or has been, legally entitled to use alcohol or a drug shall not
18 constitute a defense against any charge of violating this section.
19 (2) [Deleted by P.L. 2021, ch. 170, § 1 and P.L. 2021, ch. 171, § 1.]
1 (c) In any criminal prosecution for a violation of subsection (a), evidence as to the amount
2 of intoxicating liquor, toluene, or any controlled substance as defined in chapter 28 of title 21, or
3 any combination of these, in the defendant’s blood at the time alleged as shown by a chemical
4 analysis of the defendant’s breath, blood, saliva or urine or other bodily substance, shall be
5 admissible and competent, provided that evidence is presented that the following conditions have
6 been complied with:
7 (1) The defendant has consented to the taking of the test upon which the analysis is made.
8 Evidence that the defendant had refused to submit to the test shall not be admissible unless the
9 defendant elects to testify.
10 (2) A true copy of the report of the test result was hand delivered at the location of the test
11 or mailed within seventy-two (72) hours of the taking of the test to the person submitting to a breath
12 test.
13 (3) Any person submitting to a chemical test of blood, urine, saliva or other body fluids
14 shall have a true copy of the report of the test result mailed to him or her within thirty (30) days
15 following the taking of the test.
16 (4) The test was performed according to methods and with equipment approved by the
17 director of the department of health of the state of Rhode Island and by an authorized individual.
18 (5) Equipment used for the conduct of the tests by means of breath analysis had been tested
19 for accuracy within thirty (30) days preceding the test by personnel qualified as hereinbefore
20 provided, and breathalyzer operators shall be qualified and certified by the department of health
21 within three hundred sixty-five (365) days of the test.
22 (6) The person arrested and charged with operating a motor vehicle while under the
23 influence of intoxicating liquor, toluene, or any controlled substance as defined in chapter 28 of
24 title 21 or any combination of these in violation of subsection (a), was afforded the opportunity to
25 have an additional chemical test. The officer arresting or so charging the person shall have informed
26 the person of this right and afforded him or her a reasonable opportunity to exercise this right, and
27 a notation to this effect is made in the official records of the case in the police department. Refusal
28 to permit an additional chemical test shall render incompetent and inadmissible in evidence the
29 original report.

18 (a) Any person who operates a motor vehicle within this state shall be deemed to have
19 given his or her consent to chemical tests of his or her breath, blood, saliva and/or urine for the
20 purpose of determining the chemical content of his or her body fluids or breath. No more than two

22 or any controlled substance, as defined in § 21-28-1.02, shall be administered at the direction of a
23 law enforcement officer having reasonable grounds to believe the person to have been driving a
24 motor vehicle within this state while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, toluene, or any
25 controlled substance, as defined in chapter 28 of title 21, or any combination of these. The director
26 of the department of health is empowered to make and file, with the secretary of state, regulations

JANUARY SESSION, A.D. 2025
____________
A N A C T
RELATING TO MOTOR AND OTHER VEHICLES -- MOTOR VEHICLE OFFENSES
Introduced By: Representatives Noret, Read, Serpa, Hull, Casimiro, Dawson, and Craven
Date Introduced: April 09, 2025
Referred To: House Judiciary
(Attorney General)
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Sections 31-27-2, 31-27-2.1 and 31-27-2.8 of the General Laws in Chapter
2 31-27 entitled "Motor Vehicle Offenses" are hereby amended to read as follows:
3 31-27-2. Driving under influence of liquor or drugs. [Effective July 1, 2025.]
4 (a) Whoever drives or otherwise operates any vehicle in the state while under the influence
5 of any intoxicating liquor, drugs, toluene, or any controlled substance as defined in chapter 28 of
6 title 21, or any combination of these, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, except as provided in
7 subsection (d)(3), and shall be punished as provided in subsection (d) of this section.
8 (b)(1) Any person charged under subsection (a), whose blood alcohol concentration is eight
9 one-hundredths of one percent (.08%) or more by weight, as shown by a chemical analysis of a
10 blood, breath, or urine sample, shall be guilty of violating subsection (a). This provision shall not
11 preclude a conviction based on other admissible evidence, including the testimony of a drug
12 recognition expert or evaluator, certified pursuant to training approved by the Rhode Island
13 department of transportation office on highway safety. Proof of guilt under this section may also
14 be based on evidence that the person charged was under the influence of intoxicating liquor, drugs,
15 toluene, or any controlled substance defined in chapter 28 of title 21, or any combination of these,
16 to a degree that rendered the person incapable of safely operating a vehicle. The fact that any person
17 charged with violating this section is, or has been, legally entitled to use alcohol or a drug shall not
18 constitute a defense against any charge of violating this section.
19 (2) [Deleted by P.L. 2021, ch. 170, § 1 and P.L. 2021, ch. 171, § 1.]

1 (c) In any criminal prosecution for a violation of subsection (a), evidence as to the amount
2 of intoxicating liquor, toluene, or any controlled substance as defined in chapter 28 of title 21, or
3 any combination of these, in the defendant’s blood at the time alleged as shown by a chemical
4 analysis of the defendant’s breath, blood, saliva or urine or other bodily substance, shall be
5 admissible and competent, provided that evidence is presented that the following conditions have
6 been complied with:
7 (1) The defendant has consented to the taking of the test upon which the analysis is made.
8 Evidence that the defendant had refused to submit to the test shall not be admissible unless the
9 defendant elects to testify.
10 (2) A true copy of the report of the test result was hand delivered at the location of the test
11 or mailed within seventy-two (72) hours of the taking of the test to the person submitting to a breath
12 test.
13 (3) Any person submitting to a chemical test of blood, urine, saliva or other body fluids
14 shall have a true copy of the report of the test result mailed to him or her within thirty (30) days
15 following the taking of the test.
16 (4) The test was performed according to methods and with equipment approved by the
17 director of the department of health of the state of Rhode Island and by an authorized individual.
18 (5) Equipment used for the conduct of the tests by means of breath analysis had been tested
19 for accuracy within thirty (30) days preceding the test by personnel qualified as hereinbefore
20 provided, and breathalyzer operators shall be qualified and certified by the department of health
21 within three hundred sixty-five (365) days of the test.
22 (6) The person arrested and charged with operating a motor vehicle while under the
23 influence of intoxicating liquor, toluene, or any controlled substance as defined in chapter 28 of
24 title 21 or any combination of these in violation of subsection (a), was afforded the opportunity to
25 have an additional chemical test. The officer arresting or so charging the person shall have informed
26 the person of this right and afforded him or her a reasonable opportunity to exercise this right, and
27 a notation to this effect is made in the official records of the case in the police department. Refusal
28 to permit an additional chemical test shall render incompetent and inadmissible in evidence the
29 original report.
30 (d)(1)(i) Every person found to have violated subsection (b)(1) shall be sentenced as
31 follows: for a first violation whose blood alcohol concentration is eight one-hundredths of one
32 percent (.08%), but less than one-tenth of one percent (.1%), by weight, or who has a blood presence

9 operating a vehicle in the state while under the influence of drugs, toluene, or any controlled
10 substance as evidenced by the presence of controlled substances on or about the person or vehicle,
11 or other reliable indicia or articulable conditions thereof, but not intoxicating liquor based on a
12 preliminary breath test, results from a breathalyzer that indicates no blood alcohol concentration,
13 or both, the judge or magistrate may exercise his or her discretion and eliminate the requirement of

21 or other reliable indicia or articulable conditions thereof and intoxicating liquor based on a
22 preliminary breath test, results from a breathalyzer that indicates blood alcohol concentration, or
23 both, the judge or magistrate may shall require an ignition interlock system in addition to blood
24 and/or urine testing as a condition to operating a motor vehicle as provided in § 31-27-2.8. The

18 failure and/or positive test determination shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by up to one
19 year imprisonment, or a fine of up to one thousand dollars ($1,000), or both.
20 (c) However, in any case where a motorist is convicted of an alcohol-related offense
21 pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, the judge or magistrate may exercise his or her discretion
22 in the granting of the hardship license by imposing up to a ninety (90) day loss of license prior to
23 any imposition of the hardship license. The hardship license shall be valid for twelve (12)
24 continuous hours per day for any valid reason approved in advance by the sentencing judge or
25 magistrate, which shall include employment, medical appointments, job training, schooling, or
26 religious purposes. The hardship license shall not be for less than twelve (12) continuous hours per
27 day. A hardship license shall only be granted in conjunction with the installation of an ignition
28 interlock device and/or blood and urine testing. Any conditional driving privileges must be set by
29 the sentencing judge or magistrate after a hearing in which the motorist must provide proof of
30 employment status and hours of employment, or any other legitimate reasons justifying a hardship
31 license. These shall include, but not be limited to, any unemployment training, schooling, medical
32 appointments, therapy treatments, or any other valid requests set forth by sworn affidavit. Once
33 said hardship period has concluded, the motorist must still be subject to the conditions of the
34 ignition interlock system and/or blood and urine testing as set forth under this section for the period
LC001895 - Page 18 of 22

1 of time as directed by the court. Any individual who violates the requirements of this subsection
2 shall be subject to the penalties enumerated in § 31-11-18.1.
3 (d) Any person convicted of an offense of driving under the influence of liquor or drugs
4 resulting in death, § 31-27-2.2; driving under the influence of liquor or drugs resulting in serious
5 bodily injury, § 31-27-2.6; driving to endanger resulting in death, § 31-27-1; or driving to endanger
6 resulting in serious bodily injury, § 31-27-1.1; may, in addition to any other penalties provided by
7 law, be prohibited from operating a motor vehicle that is not equipped with an approved ignition
8 interlock system and/or blood and urine testing for one to five (5) years.
9 (e) Any person who operates a motor vehicle with a suspended license during the period
10 of suspension, and the reason for the suspension was due to a conviction of driving under the
11 influence of drugs or alcohol or a sustained violation or conviction of refusal to submit to a chemical
12 test, shall be subject to the further use of the ignition interlock system and/or blood and urine testing
13 for a period of six (6) months subsequent to the penalties enumerated in § 31-11-18.1.
14 (f) When the court orders the use of an ignition interlock system, the judge or magistrate
15 shall cause an appropriate notation to be made on the person’s record that clearly sets forth the
16 requirement for, and the period of the use of, the ignition interlock system.
17 (g) In addition to the requirements of subsection (f) of this section, the court or traffic
18 tribunal shall:
19 (1) Require proof of the installation of the ignition interlock system and periodic reporting
20 by the person for the purpose of verification of the proper operation of the ignition interlock system;
21 (2) Require the person to have the ignition interlock system monitored for the proper use
22 and accuracy by a person, firm, corporation, or other association to be approved by the division of
23 motor vehicles at least once every six (6) months, or more frequently as the circumstances may
24 require; and
25 (3) Require the person to pay the reasonable cost of leasing or buying, monitoring, and
26 maintenance of the ignition interlock system.
27 (4) The requirements under subsection (g) of this section shall be the responsibility of the
28 probation department or justice assistance, if the individual is under their control, or the division of
29 motor vehicles if the individual is not monitored as a condition of the individual’s plea or finding
30 of guilt.
31 (h) Any person granted a conditional hardship license upon proof of installation of an
32 ignition interlock device, may operate that motor vehicle during the entire twelve-hour (12) period
33 of operation granted by the sentencing judge or magistrate including during the scope of the
34 person’s employment and/or any other valid reason approved by the sentencing judge or magistrate.
LC001895 - Page 19 of 22

1 (i) If a person is required, in the course of the person’s employment, to operate a motor
2 vehicle owned or provided by the person’s employer, the person may operate that motor vehicle in
3 the course of the person’s employment without installation of an ignition interlock system if the
4 court makes specific findings expressly permitting the person to operate, in the course of the
5 person’s employment, a motor vehicle that is not equipped with an ignition interlock system.
6 (j)(1) Any person subject to an ignition interlock order and/or blood and urine testing who
7 violates such order shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year imprisonment,
8 or a fine of up to one thousand dollars ($1,000), or both.
9 (2) For a second violation within six (6) months from entry of the order, the person
10 violating the order shall be imprisoned for a term of not less than ten (10) days and not more than
11 one year.
12 (k) For the purposes of this subsection, a violation of the interlock order, includes, but is
13 not limited to:
14 (1) Altering, tampering, or in any way attempting to circumvent the operation of an ignition
15 interlock system that has been installed in the motor vehicle of a person under this section;
16 (2) Operating a motor vehicle that is not equipped with an ignition interlock system; or
17 (3) Soliciting or attempting to have another person start a motor vehicle equipped with an
18 ignition interlock system for the purpose of providing an operable motor vehicle to a person who
19 is prohibited from operating a motor vehicle that is not equipped with an ignition interlock system.
20 (l) Any person who attempts to start, or starts, a motor vehicle equipped with an ignition
21 interlock system, tampers with, or in any way attempts to circumvent, the operation of an ignition
22 interlock system that has been installed in the motor vehicle for the purpose of providing an
23 operable motor vehicle to a person who is prohibited from operating a motor vehicle that is not
24 equipped with an ignition interlock system, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by up to
25 one year imprisonment or a fine of up to one thousand dollars ($1,000), or both.
26 (m) Any ignition interlock system installed pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall
27 be equipped with a camera in order to accurately identify the driver who provides a breath sample.
28 The provisions of subsections (k) and (l) of this section shall apply to the function of the camera,
29 and or any blocking or moving of the camera as installed shall be considered a violation of
30 subsection (k)(1) of this section.

32 hereby amended by adding thereto the following section:
