11 portions of the bill, in which case the portions of the bill so approved by the governor shall
12 become law, and any revised sum or sums of money as reduced by the governor shall also
13 become law unless the general assembly repasses the original sum or sums according to the rules
14 and limitations prescribed in this section for the passage of other bills over the governor’s veto,
15 provided that each sum of money so reduced by the governor shall be separately and individually
16 reconsidered by the general assembly; or

19 portions of the bill so approved by the governor shall become law, and any item or part of an item
20 so disapproved by the governor shall not become law unless the general assembly repasses the
21 original version of the item or part of an item according to the rules and limitations prescribed in
