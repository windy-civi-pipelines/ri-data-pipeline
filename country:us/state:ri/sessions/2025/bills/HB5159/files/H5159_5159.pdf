9 As used in this chapter:
10 (1) "Authorized repair provider" means an individual or business who is affiliated with an
11 original equipment manufacturer and who has an arrangement with the original equipment
12 manufacturer, for a definite or indefinite period, under which the original equipment manufacturer
13 grants to the individual or business a license to use a trade name, service mark, or other proprietary
14 identifier for the purposes of offering the services of diagnosis, maintenance, or repair of
15 electronics-enabled agricultural equipment under the name of the original equipment manufacturer,
16 or other arrangement with the original equipment manufacturer to offer such services on behalf of
17 the original equipment manufacturer. An original equipment manufacturer who offers the services
18 of diagnosis, maintenance, or repair of its own electronics-enabled agricultural equipment, shall be

1 considered an authorized repair provider with respect to such equipment;
2 (2) "Documentation" means any manual, diagram, reporting output, service code
3 description, schematic, product guides, product service demonstrations, training seminars, clinics,
4 fleet management information, connected support, mobile applications, on-board diagnostics via
5 diagnostics port or wireless interface, or other guidance or information on service, parts, operation,
6 safety, electronic field diagnostic service tools, or training for use in effecting the services of
7 diagnosis, maintenance, or repair of electronics-enabled agricultural equipment;
8 (3) "Electronics-enabled agricultural equipment" or "equipment" means any product, part
9 of a product, or attachment to a product, when sold or leased for use in farming, ranching, or other
10 agriculture, that depends for its functioning, in whole or in part, on digital electronics embedded in

12 irrigation, or cultivating implement, baler, unmanned aircraft system, or off-road vehicle.
13 Electronics-enabled agricultural equipment or equipment does not include motor vehicles, and does

16 (4) "Embedded software" means any programmable instructions provided on firmware
17 delivered with electronics-enabled agricultural equipment, or with a part for such equipment, for
18 purposes of equipment operation, including all relevant patches and fixes made available by the
19 manufacturer of such equipment or part for such purposes;
20 (5) "Fair and reasonable terms for obtaining a part, a tool, documentation, or software"
21 means at fair and reasonable costs and terms that do not impair the contracts and agreements
22 between authorized repair providers affiliated with the original equipment manufacturer. Fair and
23 reasonable terms shall not include additional cost or burden not reasonably necessary, or designed
24 to be an impediment on the independent repair provider or equipment owner.
25 (6) "Fair and reasonable terms for software tools" means permitting or effecting the
26 diagnosis, maintenance, or repair and enabling full functionality of electronics-enabled agricultural
27 equipment without requiring authorization or Internet access, or in a manner that impairs the

29 to prevent access to source code or infringement of intellectual property in software or hardware
30 that is owned and licensed to the original equipment manufacturer by a third party and subject to
31 terms of use;
32 (7) "Firmware" means a software program or set of instructions programmed on
33 electronics-enabled agricultural equipment, or on a part for such equipment, to allow the equipment

4 manufacturer, and is engaged in the service, diagnosis, maintenance, or repair of electronics-
5 enabled agricultural equipment. An original equipment manufacturer, individual or business which
6 has a service or repair arrangement with another original equipment manufacturer shall be
7 considered an independent repair provider for purposes of those instances in which it engages in
8 the service, diagnosis, maintenance, or repair of electronics-enabled agricultural equipment that is

10 (9) "Motor vehicle" shall have the same meaning as set forth in § 31-1-3;

12 tools if such documentation, parts, and/or tools are no longer available to the original equipment
13 manufacturer.
14 6-61-4. Trade secrets.
15 Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require an original equipment manufacturer
16 to divulge a trade secret to an owner or an independent service provider except as necessary to
17 provide documentation, parts, and tools on fair and reasonable terms.
18 6-61-5. Warranty and recalls.
19 No provision in this chapter shall be construed to alter the terms of any arrangement in
