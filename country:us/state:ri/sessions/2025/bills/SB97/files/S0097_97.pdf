12 of such statutes or regulations on the prevention and detection of fraud, waste and abuse. The
13 inspector general may recommend policies that will assist in the prevention or detection of fraud,

15 body listed in § 42-9.4-1, may request the assistance of the office of inspector general with respect
16 to implementation of any reviews, audits, and/or investigations as deemed appropriate and
17 implement suggested policy or procedure changes. In such events, the inspector general may assign
18 personnel to conduct, supervise, or coordinate such activity as deemed necessary and appropriate
19 to perform their duties in a diligent and prudent manner. The inspector general may recommend
20 policies for the conduct, supervision or coordination of relationship, between state and local
21 governmental agencies as well as federal governmental agencies and nongovernmental entities with
22 respect to all matters relating to the prevention and detection of fraud, waste, abuse and

25 42-9.4-8. Inspection of records and papers -- Investigations -- Subpoenas.
26 (a) The inspector general, in carrying out the duties outlined in this chapter, shall have

28 correspondence, including information relative to the purchase of services or anticipated purchase
29 of services from any contractor by any public body listed in § 42-9.4-1, and any other data and
30 material that is maintained by or available to any public body, regardless of the media in which it
31 is maintained, which is in any way related to the programs and operations with respect to the State
32 of Rhode Island, including any local town, municipality or city.
33 (b) The inspector general may request information, cooperation and assistance from any
34 state, or local governmental agency, as may be necessary for carrying out their duties and
LC000486 - Page 4 of 10

1 responsibilities. Upon receipt of such request, each person in charge of, or the governing body of
2 any public body listed in § 42-9.4-1, shall furnish to the inspector general or their authorized agent
3 or representative such information, cooperation and assistance, including information relative to
4 the purchase of services or anticipated purchase of services from any contractor by any public body
5 within ten (10) business days of receipt of the inspector general's request. If the request for the
6 information requested cannot be complied within the ten (10) business days, the senior official of
7 the governmental agency shall notify the inspector general, before the expiration of the ten (10)
8 business days, as to the reason that the request cannot be complied with in the time frame of this
9 section and shall provide a specific date for expected compliance.
10 (c) The inspector general may initiate and conduct investigations, audits and compliance
11 reviews and shall prepare detailed reports relating to findings and conclusions concerning the
12 administration of the programs and operations of the applicable public bodies listed in § 42-9.4-1,
13 as are in the judgment of the inspector general necessary and may conduct an examination of any
14 public documents.
15 (d) The inspector general shall have direct and prompt access to the head of any public
16 body listed in § 42-9.4-1, when necessary for any purpose pertaining to the performance of their
17 duties and responsibilities under this chapter.
18 (e) The inspector general may request the production, on a voluntary basis, of testimony or
19 documents from any individual, firm or nongovernmental entity which relate to actions or matters
20 that pertain to state, municipal or local governmental agencies as dictated by their duties and
21 responsibilities.
22 (f)(1) The inspector general may issue a subpoena for the production of all records, reports,
23 audits, reviews, papers, books, documents, recommendations, correspondence and any other data
24 and material relevant to any matter under audit or investigation, pursuant to the provisions of this
25 chapter, no matter in which media the information is maintained.
26 (2) A subpoena may be issued only when a person, corporation or other entity under
27 investigation or being audited refuses to voluntarily comply with a request from the inspector
28 general.
29 (3) Such subpoena shall be served in the same manner as a subpoena for the production of
30 documents in civil cases issued on behalf of the State of Rhode Island, and all provisions of law
31 relative to said subpoena shall apply to a subpoena issued pursuant to this chapter. Any justice of
32 the superior court may, upon application by the inspector general, issue an order to compel the
33 production of records, reports, audits, reviews, papers, books, documents, recommendations,
34 correspondence and any other data and material in the same manner and to the same extent as if the
LC000486 - Page 5 of 10

1 matter was before said superior court. Any failure to obey such order may be punished by the
2 superior court as a contempt of court.
3 (4) Any subpoena issued pursuant to this section, shall not be made public by the inspector
4 general or any officer or employee of that office, nor shall any documents or records provided
5 pursuant to this section be made public until such time as it is necessary for the inspector general
6 as required by the performance of their official duties. The production of such documents or records
7 pursuant to subpoena shall be governed by the same provisions with reference to secrecy, which
8 govern the proceedings of a grand jury. Disclosure of such production, attendance, and testimony
9 may be made to such members of the staff of the office of the inspector general as is deemed
10 necessary in the performance of the inspector general's duties and responsibilities under this chapter
11 and such members of the staff may be present at the production of records.
12 42-9.4-9. Subpoena for witness testimony and for release of material evidence.
13 (a) Whenever the inspector general has reason to believe that a person has information or
14 evidence in their possession with respect to any matter which is within the inspector general's
15 jurisdiction to investigate, they may issue a subpoena for the attendance and testimony, under oath
16 of any person as designated, or the surrender of identified item(s) of evidence; provided, however,
17 that such subpoena may be issued by the inspector general only in the performance of official duties
18 relating to the detection of fraud, waste, abuse and mismanagement. The subpoena for testimony
19 or specific items identified as needed in support of an investigation shall include: the name and
20 address of the prospective witness or a list of specific items identified as needed for the
21 investigation and the reasons for requesting a subpoena for testimony or production of items
22 deemed necessary to support the investigation.
23 (b) The inspector general or anyone duly authorized by law shall serve such subpoena.
24 Once the subpoena is served, the serving officer shall annotate the time and date served, the person
25 served and the location of service.
26 (c)(1) A witness required by subpoena to attend and testify under oath and/or produce
27 books and records or other items as demanded, shall be given not less than forty-eight (48) hour
28 notice of the time and place for the taking of testimony or delivery of subpoenaed items, unless
29 such notice shall unduly interfere with the conduct of the investigation.
30 (2) Such witness, at the time of service of a subpoena, shall be notified of the matter under
31 investigation, concerning which such witness will be required to testify. A subject of an
32 investigation is a person whose conduct is within the scope of the investigation and is suspected of
33 committing or being party to an offense under investigation. The failure to furnish such witness
34 with any notice or information required to be given by this section shall cause the issued subpoena
LC000486 - Page 6 of 10

1 to be invalid.
2 (d) A person subpoenaed to testify under oath shall appear and testify under oath at the
3 time and place designated on the subpoena. In addition, the witness shall be notified that they have
4 a right to consult with and to have an attorney present at the time the testimony is taken and that
5 they have a constitutional right not to furnish or produce evidence, that may tend to incriminate
6 them.
7 (e) The terms of any such subpoena shall be reasonable and focused on specific testimony
8 or evidence sought and shall directly relate to the matters under investigation. A subpoena issued
9 that is broad in nature is not considered valid. No subpoena may be issued for purposes of
10 harassment or for any illegitimate or improper purpose. All constitutional and statutory rights and
11 privileges which exist with respect to any subpoena issued by the inspector general, including the
12 privilege against self-incrimination, shall have the same force and effect as any and all existing
13 laws and constitutional rights.
14 (f) A subpoenaed person may object to the subpoena served upon them, in advance of the
15 return date of the subpoena, by a motion to quash filed in the superior court of the State of Rhode
16 Island. The filing of a motion to quash shall stay all pending subpoenas until further order of the
17 superior court. Any justice of the superior court may, upon application by the inspector general,
18 issue an order to compel the attendance of the witnesses subpoenaed and the giving of testimony
19 under oath, in furtherance of any audit or investigation under this chapter in the same manner and
20 to the same extent as before the superior court. Failure to obey any order of the court with respect
21 to a subpoena may be punished by the court as contempt.
22 (g) Any subpoena issued pursuant to this section, shall not be made public by the inspector
23 general or any persons subject to their direction or by any member of the inspector general's office
24 designated to hear testimony under this section, and the same provisions with reference to secrecy,
25 which govern grand jury proceedings, shall govern testimony given. Whoever violates the
26 provisions of this subsection shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than six (6) months
27 or by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000). Disclosure of such testimony may be
28 made to such members of the staff of the office of inspector general, as is deemed necessary by the
29 inspector general, to assist in the performance of the office's duties and responsibilities and those
30 members of the staff may be present at the taking of such testimony.
31 42-9.4-10. Complaints -- Investigation.
32 (a) The inspector general shall accept and may investigate or audit complaints or
33 information from any individual concerning the possible existence of any activity constituting
34 fraud, waste, abuse and mismanagement relating to programs and operations as listed in § 42-9.4-
LC000486 - Page 7 of 10

1 1.
2 (b) The inspector general shall not, after receipt of a complaint or information from an
3 employee who requests confidentiality, disclose the identity of the employee without the written
4 consent of said employee, unless the inspector general determines such disclosure is necessary and
5 unavoidable during the course of an investigation. In such event, the employee shall be notified
6 immediately of such disclosure.
7 (c) Employees are protected under the "Rhode Island whistleblowers' protection act,"
8 chapter 50 of title 28.
9 42-9.4-11. Reports to the attorney general or United States attorney.
10 (a) In carrying out their duties and responsibilities, the inspector general shall report to the
11 attorney general, the United States attorney or both, whenever the inspector general has reasonable
12 grounds to believe there has been a violation of federal or state criminal law. The attorney general
13 may institute appropriate proceedings, in the furtherance of completing an investigation and, if
14 warranted, to refer a matter for prosecution.
15 (b) The inspector general shall refer audit or investigative findings to the state ethics
16 commission, or to any other federal, state or local agency, which has an interest in said findings.
17 (c) Any referrals made under this section shall not be made public.
18 42-9.4-12. Civil actions.
19 The inspector general shall have the authority to institute a civil recovery action if
20 authorized by the attorney general. In any case where the inspector general has discovered
21 fraudulent acts and believes that civil recovery proceedings may be appropriate, the inspector
22 general shall refer the matter to the attorney general. The attorney general may institute whatever
23 proceedings they deem appropriate, may refer the matter to another state or local agency, may
24 authorize the initiation of appropriate civil proceedings by the inspector general, may retain the
25 matter for further investigation, or may remand the matter to the inspector general for further
26 investigation.
27 42-9.4-13. Annual and interim reports.
28 (a) The office of inspector general shall, no later than April 1 of each year, prepare a report
29 summarizing the activities of the office of inspector general for the prior calendar year. The office
30 of inspector general may also prepare interim reports. These reports shall be forwarded to the
31 governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, secretary of state, general treasurer and the general
32 assembly and shall be made available to the public.
33 (b) The report shall include, but not be limited to: a description of significant problems in
34 the areas of fraud, waste and abuse within programs and operations within the jurisdiction of the
LC000486 - Page 8 of 10

1 office; a description of the recommendations for corrective action made by the office during the
2 reporting period with respect to significant deficiencies in the areas of fraud, waste and abuse; the
3 identification of each significant recommendation described in previous annual reports on which
4 corrective action has not been completed; a summary of matters referred to prosecuting authorities
5 and the prosecutions and convictions which have resulted; a summary of any matters concerning
6 the recovery of monies as a result of a civil suit by the office of inspector general or a referral to
7 another agency for the purposes of such suit; a list of all audit reports completed by the office
8 during the reporting period and a statement of recommendations of amendments to this chapter or
9 the rules, regulations or procedures governing the office of inspector general which would improve
10 the effectiveness or the operation of the office.
11 (c) The head or governing body of each public body may, within sixty (60) days of receipt
12 of the report, comment upon any references to such public body contained within the report. Such
13 comment, if any, shall be forwarded to the governor, the attorney general, the general assembly and
14 the office of inspector general.
15 (d) The report of the inspector general shall be made public on the day of filing; provided,
16 that the report shall not list the names of individuals or corporations, nor describe them with
17 sufficient particularity as to readily identify them to the general public in those cases in which no
18 official disposition has been made by the office of inspector general, the office of attorney general
19 or the local office of the United States Attorney.
20 42-9.4-14. Confidentiality of records.
21 (a) All records of the office of inspector general shall be confidential and shall not be public
22 records, unless it is necessary for the inspector general to make such records public in the
23 performance of their duties.
24 (b) Violation of the provisions of the confidentiality of proceedings by the inspector general
25 or any member of the staff, or by any member of the inspector general's office, shall be punished
26 by imprisonment for not more than six (6) months or by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars
27 ($1,000).
