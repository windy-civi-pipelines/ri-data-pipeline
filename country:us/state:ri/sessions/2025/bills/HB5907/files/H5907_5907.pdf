RELATING TO COURTS AND CIVIL PROCEDURE -- PROCEDURE GENERALLY --
LITIGATION LENDING AGREEMENTS
Introduced By: Representatives Potter, Baginski, Batista, Shanley, and Dawson
Date Introduced: February 28, 2025
Referred To: House Judiciary
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Title 9 of the General Laws entitled "COURTS AND CIVIL PROCEDURE
2 -- PROCEDURE GENERALLY" is hereby amended by adding thereto the following chapter:
3 CHAPTER 3.1
4 LITIGATION LENDING AGREEMENTS
5 9-3.1-1. Legislative findings.
6 The general assembly finds and declares that:
7 (1) Litigation financing contracts are being entered into where companies advance money
8 to a litigant in return for payment from litigation proceeds at effective annual interest rates far
9 exceeding state usury limits; and
10 (2) These contracts often bear annual interest rates which exceed one hundred percent
11 (100%); and
12 (3) These rates are detrimental to the general welfare of the citizens of this state and it is
13 necessary to enact legislation to ensure that litigation-funding advances conform to state laws
14 governing usurious loans.
15 9-3.1-2. Litigation lending agreement defined.
16 A "litigation lending agreement" (LLA) is any agreement whereby monies are paid to
17 parties to civil litigation (litigants) in consideration for a litigant's agreement to repay these monies
18 (with or without interest, one-time charges, use fees, or any other add-on charges) from the proceeds

1 of the litigation. Not included in the definition of an LLA are advancements of expenses of litigation
2 made by attorneys on behalf of their clients, as permitted by rule 1.8(e) of the Rhode Island rules
3 of professional conduct.
4 9-3.1-3. Litigation advances considered loans pursuant to state usury law.
5 All payments made by a litigant under an LLA greater than the amount received by the
6 litigant under the LLA shall be considered interest on loans subject to the provisions of chapter 26
7 of title 6 ("interest and usury") regardless of:
8 (1) Whether an LLA characterizes itself as a "loan," an "advance," an "investment," an
9 "assignment of proceeds," or any other characterization;
10 (2) Whether monies to be repaid under the LLA are called "interest," "use fees," or any
11 other term;
12 (3) Whether the amount received by the litigant under the LLA otherwise exceeds any
13 monetary limit for loans and interest rates falling within the provisions of chapter 26 of title 6; and
14 (4) Whether the obligation on the part of the litigant to repay monies is contingent upon a
15 particular outcome of the litigation.
16 SECTION 2. This act shall take effect upon passage.
