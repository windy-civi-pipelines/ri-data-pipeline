34 (the “subtrahend”) from the five-year average investment return of the retirement system
LC001005 - Page 10 of 24
1 determined as of the last day of the plan year preceding the calendar year in which the adjustment
2 is granted, said percentage not to exceed four percent (4%) and not to be less than zero percent
3 (0%). The “five-year average investment return” shall mean the average of the investment returns
4 of the most recent five (5) plan years as determined by the retirement board. In the event the

20 2012, the benefit adjustments under subsection (h)(1)(B) for any plan year shall be reduced to
21 twenty-five percent (25%) of the benefit adjustment unless the funded ratio of the employees’
22 retirement system of Rhode Island, the judicial retirement benefits trust, and the state police
23 retirement benefits trust, calculated by the system’s actuary on an aggregate basis, exceeds eighty
24 percent (80%) in which event the benefit adjustment will be reinstated for all members for such
25 plan year. Effective July 1, 2024, the funded ratio of the employees’ retirement system of Rhode
26 Island, the judicial retirement benefits trust, and the state police retirement benefits trust, calculated
27 by the system’s actuary on an aggregate basis, of exceeding eighty percent (80%) for the benefit
28 adjustment to be reinstated for all members for such plan year shall be replaced with seventy-five

3 will be reinstated for all members for such plan year.
4 In determining whether a funding level under this subsection (c)(2) has been achieved, the
5 actuary shall calculate the funding percentage after taking into account the reinstatement of any
6 current or future benefit adjustment provided under this section.
7 (3) Notwithstanding subsection (c)(2), for each municipal plan that has a Funded Ratio of
8 less than eighty percent (80%) as of June 30, 2012, in each fifth plan year commencing after June
9 30, 2012, commencing with the plan year ending June 30, 2017, and subsequently at intervals of
10 five (5) plan years, a benefit adjustment shall be calculated and made in accordance with subsection
11 (c)(1) above until the municipal plan’s Funded Ratio exceeds eighty percent (80%).
12 (d) This subsection (d) shall become effective July 1, 2015.
13 (1)(A) As soon as administratively reasonable following the enactment into law of this
14 subsection (d)(1)(A), a one-time benefit adjustment shall be provided to members and/or
15 beneficiaries of members who retired on or before June 30, 2012, in the amount of two percent
16 (2%) of the lesser of either the employee’s retirement allowance or the first twenty-five thousand
17 dollars ($25,000) of the member’s retirement allowance. This one-time benefit adjustment shall be
18 provided without regard to the retiree’s age or number of years since retirement.
19 (B) Notwithstanding the prior subsections of this section, for all present and former
20 employees, active and retired employees, and beneficiaries receiving any retirement, disability or
21 death allowance or benefit of any kind by reason of adoption of this section by their employer, the
22 annual benefit adjustment provided in any calendar year under this section for adjustments on and
23 after January 1, 2016, and subject to subsection (d)(2) below, shall be equal to (I) multiplied by
24 (II):
25 (I) shall equal the sum of fifty percent (50%) of (i) plus fifty percent (50%) of (ii) where:
26 (i) is equal to the percentage determined by subtracting five and one-half percent (5.5%)
27 (the “subtrahend”) from the five-year average investment return of the retirement system
28 determined as of the last day of the plan year preceding the calendar year in which the adjustment
29 is granted, said percentage not to exceed four percent (4%) and not to be less than zero percent
30 (0%). The “five-year average investment return” shall mean the average of the investment returns
31 of the most recent five (5) plan years as determined by the retirement board. In the event the
32 retirement board adjusts the actuarially assumed rate of return for the system, either upward or
33 downward, the subtrahend shall be adjusted either upward or downward in the same amount.
34 (ii) is equal to the lesser of three percent (3%) or the percentage increase in the Consumer
LC001005 - Page 21 of 24
1 Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) as published by the U.S. Department of Labor
2 Statistics determined as of September 30 of the prior calendar year.
3 In no event shall the sum of (i) plus (ii) exceed three and one-half percent (3.5%) or be less
4 than zero percent (0%).
5 (II) is equal to the lesser of either the member’s retirement allowance or the first twenty-
6 five thousand eight hundred and fifty-five dollars ($25,855) of retirement allowance, such amount
7 to be indexed annually in the same percentage as determined under (d)(1)(B)(I) above.
8 The benefit adjustments provided by this subsection (d)(1)(B) shall be provided to all
9 retirees entitled to receive a benefit adjustment as of June 30, 2012, under the law then in effect,
10 and for all other retirees the benefit adjustments shall commence upon the third anniversary of the
11 date of retirement or the date on which the retiree reaches their Social Security retirement age,
12 whichever is later; or for municipal police and fire retiring under the provisions of § 45-21.2-
13 5(b)(1)(A), the benefit adjustment provided by this subsection (d)(1)(B) shall commence on the
14 later of the third anniversary of the date of retirement or the date on which the retiree reaches age
15 fifty-five (55); or for municipal police and fire retiring under the provisions of § 45-21.2-5(b)(1)(B),
16 the benefit adjustment provided by this subsection (d)(1)(B) shall commence on the later of the
17 third anniversary of the date of retirement or the date on which the retiree reaches age fifty (50).
18 (2) Except for municipal employees and/or beneficiaries of municipal employees who
19 retired on or before June 30, 2012, the benefit adjustments under subsection (d)(1)(B) for any plan
20 year shall be reduced to twenty-five percent (25%) of the benefit adjustment for each municipal
21 plan within the municipal employees’ retirement system unless the municipal plan is determined to
22 be funded at a funded ratio equal to or greater than eighty percent (80%) as of the end of the
23 immediately preceding plan year in accordance with the retirement system’s actuarial valuation
24 report as prepared by the system’s actuary, in which event the benefit adjustment will be reinstated
25 for all members for such plan year. Effective July 1, 2024, the funded ratio for each municipal plan
26 within the municipal employees’ retirement system, calculated by the system’s actuary, of equal to
27 or greater than eighty percent (80%) for the benefit adjustment to be reinstated for all members for
28 such plan year shall be replaced with seventy-five percent (75%). For plan year 2025, eligible
29 retirees who retired after July 1, 2012, shall receive a one-time full COLA of two and eighty-nine
30 one hundredths percent (2.89%).
31 In determining whether a funding level under this subsection (d)(2) has been achieved, the
32 actuary shall calculate the funding percentage after taking into account the reinstatement of any
33 current or future benefit adjustment provided under this section.
34 (3) Effective for members and/or beneficiaries of members who retired after June 30, 2012,
LC001005 - Page 22 of 24
1 or on or before June 30, 2015, the dollar amount in (d)(1)(B)(II) of twenty-five thousand eight
2 hundred and fifty-five dollars ($25,855) shall be replaced with thirty-one thousand and twenty-six
3 dollars ($31,026) until the municipal plan’s funded ratio exceeds eighty percent (80%). Effective
4 July 1, 2024, the funded ratio for each municipal plan within the municipal employees’ retirement
5 system, calculated by the system’s actuary, of exceeding eighty percent (80%) for the benefit
6 adjustment to be reinstated for all members for such plan year shall be replaced with seventy-five
7 percent (75%).
8 (e) Upon acceptance of any of the plans in this section, each employee shall on January 1
9 next succeeding the acceptance, contribute by means of salary deductions, pursuant to § 45-21-41,
10 one percent (1%) of the employee’s compensation concurrently with and in addition to
11 contributions otherwise being made to the retirement system.
12 (f) The city or town shall make any additional contributions to the system, pursuant to the
13 terms of § 45-21-42, for the payment of any benefits provided by this section.
14 (g) The East Greenwich town council shall be allowed to accept Plan C of subsection (a)(3)
15 of this section for all employees of the town of East Greenwich who either, pursuant to contract
16 negotiations, bargain for Plan C, or who are non-union employees who are provided with Plan C
17 and who shall all collectively be referred to as the “Municipal-COLA Group” and shall be separate
18 from all other employees of the town and school department, union or non-union, who are in the
19 same pension group but have not been granted Plan C benefits. Upon acceptance by the town
20 council, benefits in accordance with this section shall be available to all such employees who retire
21 on or after January 1, 2003.
22 (h) Effective for members and/or beneficiaries of members who have retired on or before
23 July 1, 2015, and without regard to whether the retired member or beneficiary is receiving a benefit
24 adjustment under this section, a one-time stipend of five hundred dollars ($500) shall be payable
25 within sixty (60) days following the enactment of the legislation implementing this provision, and
26 a second one-time stipend of five hundred dollars ($500) in the same month of the following year.
27 These stipends shall not be considered cost of living adjustments under the prior provisions of this
28 section.
29 SECTION 5. This act shall take effect upon passage.

Referred To: Senate Finance
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Sections 16-16-26 and 16-16-40 of the General Laws in Chapter 16-16

8 upon attaining the age of sixty (60) years.
9 (c) The spouse, former spouse divorced, or domestic partner was living with the deceased

17 of a domestic partnership shall render the person ineligible to receive current or future benefits

9 $40,001 and over $1,375 $1,725
10 (f) The former spouse divorced shall be entitled to monthly benefits, payable in accordance
11 with the table provided in subsection (e) of this section, only if there are no dependent children,
12 parents, or other spouse or domestic partner entitled to benefits.
13 (g) A yearly adjustment of the base benefit, and a yearly cost-of-living adjustment for

17 (a) All teachers and all beneficiaries of teachers receiving any service retirement or
18 ordinary or accidental disability retirement allowance pursuant to the provisions of this chapter and

20 adjustment equal to one and one-half percent (1.5%) per year of the original retirement allowance,
21 not compounded, for each year the retirement allowance has been in effect. For purposes of
22 computation credit shall be given for a full calendar year regardless of the effective date of the
23 retirement allowance. This cost of living retirement adjustment shall be added to the amount of the
24 service retirement allowance as of January 1, 1970, and payment shall begin as of July 1, 1970. An
25 additional cost of living retirement adjustment shall be added to the original retirement allowance
26 equal to three percent (3%) of the original retirement allowance on the first day of January, 1971,

28 (b) All teachers and beneficiaries of teachers receiving any service retirement or ordinary
29 disability retirement allowance pursuant to the provisions of this title who retired on or after January

31 a cost of living adjustment, in addition to their retirement allowance, an amount equal to three
32 percent (3%) of the original retirement allowance. In each succeeding year thereafter, on the first
33 day of January, the retirement allowance shall be increased an additional three percent (3%) of the
34 original retirement allowance, not compounded, to be continued through December 31, 1980.
LC001005 - Page 2 of 24

1 (c)(1) Beginning on January 1, 1981, for all teachers and beneficiaries of teachers receiving
2 any service retirement and all teachers and all beneficiaries of teachers who have completed at least
3 ten (10) years of contributory service on or before July 1, 2005, pursuant to the provisions of this
4 chapter, and for all teachers and beneficiaries of teachers who receive a disability retirement
5 allowance pursuant to §§ 16-16-14 — 16-16-17, the cost of living adjustment shall be computed
6 and paid at the rate of three percent (3%) of the original retirement allowance or the retirement
7 allowance as computed in accordance with § 16-16-40.1, compounded annually from the year for
8 which the cost of living adjustment was determined to be payable by the retirement board pursuant
9 to the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) of this section. Such cost of living adjustments are available
10 to teachers who retire before October 1, 2009, or are eligible to retire as of September 30, 2009.
11 (2) The provisions of this subsection shall be deemed to apply prospectively only and no
12 retroactive payment shall be made.
13 (3) The retirement allowance of all teachers and all beneficiaries of teachers who have not
14 completed at least ten (10) years of contributory service on or before July 1, 2005, or were not
15 eligible to retire as of September 30, 2009, shall, on the month following the third anniversary date
16 of the retirement, and on the month following the anniversary date of each succeeding year be
17 adjusted and computed by multiplying the retirement allowance by three percent (3%) or the
18 percentage of increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) as published
19 by the United States Department of Labor Statistics, determined as of September 30 of the prior
20 calendar year, whichever is less; the cost of living adjustment shall be compounded annually from
21 the year for which the cost of living adjustment was determined payable by the retirement board;
22 provided, that no adjustment shall cause any retirement allowance to be decreased from the
23 retirement allowance provided immediately before such adjustment.
24 (d) For teachers not eligible to retire in accordance with this chapter as of September 30,
25 2009, and not eligible upon passage of this article, and for their beneficiaries, the cost of living
26 adjustment described in subsection (c)(3) of this section shall only apply to the first thirty-five
27 thousand dollars ($35,000) of retirement allowance, indexed annually, and shall commence upon
28 the third (3rd) anniversary of the date of retirement or when the retiree reaches age sixty-five (65),
29 whichever is later. The thirty-five thousand dollar ($35,000) limit shall increase annually by the
30 percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) as published
31 by the United States Department of Labor Statistics determined as of September 30 of the prior
32 calendar year or three percent (3%), whichever is less. The first thirty-five thousand dollars
33 ($35,000), as indexed, of retirement allowance shall be multiplied by the percentage of increase in
34 the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) as published by the United States
LC001005 - Page 3 of 24

1 Department of Labor Statistics determined as of September 30 of the prior calendar year or three
2 percent (3%), whichever is less, on the month following the anniversary date of each succeeding
3 year. For teachers eligible to retire as of September 30, 2009, or eligible upon passage of this article,
4 and for their beneficiaries, the provisions of this subsection (d) shall not apply.
5 (e) The provisions of §§ 45-13-7 — 45-13-10 shall not apply to this section.
6 (f) This subsection (f) shall be effective for the period July 1, 2012, through June 30, 2015.
7 (1) Notwithstanding the prior paragraphs of this section, and subject to subsection (f)(2)
8 below, for all present and former teachers, active and retired teachers, and beneficiaries receiving
9 any retirement, disability or death allowance or benefit of any kind, the annual benefit adjustment
10 provided in any calendar year under this section shall be equal to (A) multiplied by (B) where (A)
11 is equal to the percentage determined by subtracting five and one-half percent (5.5%) (the
12 “subtrahend”) from the Five-Year Average Investment Return of the retirement system determined
13 as of the last day of the plan year preceding the calendar year in which the adjustment is granted,
14 said percentage not to exceed four percent (4%) and not to be less than zero percent (0%), and (B)
15 is equal to the lesser of the teacher’s retirement allowance or the first twenty-five thousand dollars
16 ($25,000) of retirement allowance, such twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) amount to be
17 indexed annually in the same percentage as determined under (f)(1)(A) above. The “Five-Year
18 Average Investment Return” shall mean the average of the investment returns of the most recent
19 five (5) plan years as determined by the retirement board. Subject to subsection (f)(2) below, the
20 benefit adjustment provided by this subsection (f)(1) shall commence upon the third (3rd)
21 anniversary of the date of retirement or the date on which the retiree reaches their Social Security
22 retirement age, whichever is later. In the event the retirement board adjusts the actuarially assumed
23 rate of return for the system, either upward or downward, the subtrahend shall be adjusted either
24 upward or downward in the same amount.
25 (2) Except as provided in subsection (f)(3), the benefit adjustments under this section for
26 any plan year shall be suspended in their entirety unless the funded ratio of the employees’
27 retirement system of Rhode Island, the judicial retirement benefits trust, and the state police
28 retirement benefits trust, calculated by the system’s actuary on an aggregate basis, exceeds eighty
29 percent (80%) in which event the benefit adjustment will be reinstated for all teachers for such plan
30 year.
31 In determining whether a funding level under this subsection (f)(2) has been achieved, the
32 actuary shall calculate the funding percentage after taking into account the reinstatement of any
33 current or future benefit adjustment provided under this section.
34 (3) Notwithstanding subsection (f)(2), in each fifth plan year commencing after June 30,
LC001005 - Page 4 of 24

1 2012, commencing with the plan year ending June 30, 2017, and subsequently at intervals of five
2 plan years, a benefit adjustment shall be calculated and made in accordance with subsection (f)(1)
3 above until the funded ratio of the employees’ retirement system of Rhode Island, the judicial
4 retirement benefits trust, and the state police retirement benefits trust, calculated by the system’s
5 actuary on an aggregate basis, exceeds eighty percent (80%).
6 (4) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the provisions of this subsection
7 (f) shall become effective July 1, 2012, and shall apply to any benefit adjustments not granted on
8 or prior to June 30, 2012.
9 (g) This subsection (g) shall become effective July 1, 2015.
10 (1)(A) As soon as administratively reasonable following the enactment into law of this
11 subsection (g)(1)(A), a one-time benefit adjustment shall be provided to teachers and/or
12 beneficiaries of teachers who retired on or before June 30, 2012, in the amount of two percent (2%)
13 of the lesser of either the teacher’s retirement allowance or the first twenty-five thousand dollars
14 ($25,000) of the teacher’s retirement allowance. This one-time benefit adjustment shall be provided
15 without regard to the retiree’s age or number of years since retirement.
16 (B) Notwithstanding the prior subsections of this section, for all present and former
17 teachers, active and retired teachers, and beneficiaries receiving any retirement, disability, or death
18 allowance or benefit of any kind, the annual benefit adjustment provided in any calendar year under
19 this section for adjustments on and after January 1, 2016, and subject to subsection (g)(2) below,
20 shall be equal to (I) multiplied by (II):
21 (I) shall equal the sum of fifty percent (50%) of (i) plus fifty percent (50%) of (ii) where:
22 (i) is equal to the percentage determined by subtracting five and one-half percent (5.5%)
23 (the “subtrahend”) from the five-year average investment return of the retirement system
24 determined as of the last day of the plan year preceding the calendar year in which the adjustment
25 is granted, said percentage not to exceed four percent (4%) and not to be less than zero percent
26 (0%). The “five-year average investment return” shall mean the average of the investment returns
27 of the most recent five (5) plan years as determined by the retirement board. In the event the
28 retirement board adjusts the actuarially assumed rate of return for the system, either upward or

14 for each calendar year the retirement allowance has been in effect. For the purposes of computation,
15 credit shall be given for a full calendar year regardless of the effective date of the retirement
16 allowance. This cost of living adjustment shall be added to the amount of the retirement allowance
17 as of January 1, 1968, and an additional one and one-half percent (1.5%) shall be added to the
18 original retirement allowance in each succeeding year during the month of January, and provided

33 employee or beneficiary. For the purposes of computation, credit shall be given for a full calendar
34 year regardless of the effective date of the service retirement allowance.

16 were not eligible to retire as of September 30, 2009, shall, on the month following the third
17 anniversary date of retirement, and on the month following the anniversary date of each succeeding
18 year be adjusted and computed by multiplying the retirement allowance by three percent (3%) or
19 the percentage of increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) as
20 published by the United States Department of Labor Statistics determined as of September 30 of
21 the prior calendar year, whichever is less; the cost of living adjustment shall be compounded
22 annually from the year for which the cost of living adjustment was determined payable by the
23 retirement board; provided, that no adjustment shall cause any retirement allowance to be decreased
24 from the retirement allowance provided immediately before such adjustment.
25 (d) For state employees not eligible to retire in accordance with this chapter as of
26 September 30, 2009, and not eligible upon passage of this article, and for their beneficiaries, the

32 U) as published by the United States Department of Labor Statistics determined as of September
33 30 of the prior calendar year or three percent (3%), whichever is less. The first thirty-five thousand

15 45-21-52. Automatic increase in service retirement allowance.
16 (a) The local legislative bodies of the cities and towns may extend to their respective

21 of the year their city or town accepts this section, receive a cost of living adjustment equal to one
22 and one-half percent (1.5%) per year of the original retirement allowance, not compounded, for
23 each calendar year the retirement allowance has been in effect. This cost of living adjustment is
24 added to the amount of the retirement allowance as of January 1 following acceptance of this
25 provision, and an additional one and one-half percent (1.5%) is added to the original retirement
26 allowance in each succeeding year during the month of January, and provided, further, that this
27 additional cost of living increase is three percent (3%) for the year beginning January 1 of the year
28 the plan is accepted and each succeeding year.
29 (2) Plan B. All employees and beneficiaries of those employees receiving a retirement
30 allowance under the provisions of this chapter on December 31 of the year their municipality
31 accepts this section, receive a cost of living adjustment equal to three percent (3%) of their original
32 retirement allowance. This adjustment is added to the amount of the retirement allowance as of

4 the date of the retirement, receive a cost of living adjustment in an amount equal to three percent
5 (3%) of the original retirement allowance.
6 (b) In each succeeding year in the month of January, the retirement allowance is increased
7 an additional three percent (3%) of the original retirement allowance, not compounded.
8 (c) This subsection (c) shall be effective for the period July 1, 2012, through June 30, 2015.
9 (1) Notwithstanding any other subsections of this section, and subject to subsection (c)(2)
10 below, for all present and former employees, active and retired members, and beneficiaries
11 receiving any retirement, disability or death allowance or benefit of any kind by reason of adoption
12 of this section by their employer, the annual benefit adjustment provided in any calendar year under
13 this section shall be equal to (A) multiplied by (B) where (A) is equal to the percentage determined
14 by subtracting five and one-half percent (5.5%) (the “subtrahend”) from the Five-Year Average
15 Investment Return of the retirement system determined as of the last day of the plan year preceding
16 the calendar year in which the adjustment is granted, said percentage not to exceed four percent
17 (4%) and not to be less than zero percent (0%), and (B) is equal to the lesser of the member’s
18 retirement allowance or the first twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) of retirement allowance,
19 such twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) amount to be indexed annually in the same percentage
20 as determined under (c)(1)(A) above. The “Five-Year Average Investment Return” shall mean the
21 average of the investment returns of the most recent five (5) plan years as determined by the
22 retirement board. Subject to subsection (c)(2) below, the benefit adjustment provided by this

24 date on which the retiree reaches their Social Security retirement age, whichever is later; or for
25 municipal police and fire retiring under the provisions of chapter 21.2 of this title, the benefit
26 adjustment provided by this subsection (c)(1) shall commence on the later of the third (3rd)
27 anniversary of the date of retirement or the date on which the retiree reaches age fifty-five (55). In
28 the event the retirement board adjusts the actuarially assumed rate of return for the system, either
29 upward or downward, the subtrahend shall be adjusted either upward or downward in the same
30 amount.
31 (2) Except as provided in subsection (c)(3) the benefit adjustments provided under this
32 section for any plan year shall be reduced to twenty-five percent (25%) of the benefit adjustment

34 plan is determined to be funded at a Funded Ratio equal to or greater than eighty percent (80%) as
LC001005 - Page 20 of 24

1 of the end of the immediately preceding plan year in accordance with the retirement system’s
2 actuarial valuation report as prepared by the system’s actuary, in which event the benefit adjustment
3 will be reinstated for all members for such plan year.
4 In determining whether a funding level under this subsection (c)(2) has been achieved, the
5 actuary shall calculate the funding percentage after taking into account the reinstatement of any
6 current or future benefit adjustment provided under this section.
7 (3) Notwithstanding subsection (c)(2), for each municipal plan that has a Funded Ratio of
8 less than eighty percent (80%) as of June 30, 2012, in each fifth plan year commencing after June
9 30, 2012, commencing with the plan year ending June 30, 2017, and subsequently at intervals of
10 five (5) plan years, a benefit adjustment shall be calculated and made in accordance with subsection
11 (c)(1) above until the municipal plan’s Funded Ratio exceeds eighty percent (80%).

15 beneficiaries of members who retired on or before June 30, 2012, in the amount of two percent
16 (2%) of the lesser of either the employee’s retirement allowance or the first twenty-five thousand
17 dollars ($25,000) of the member’s retirement allowance. This one-time benefit adjustment shall be
18 provided without regard to the retiree’s age or number of years since retirement.
19 (B) Notwithstanding the prior subsections of this section, for all present and former
20 employees, active and retired employees, and beneficiaries receiving any retirement, disability or
21 death allowance or benefit of any kind by reason of adoption of this section by their employer, the
22 annual benefit adjustment provided in any calendar year under this section for adjustments on and
23 after January 1, 2016, and subject to subsection (d)(2) below, shall be equal to (I) multiplied by
24 (II):
25 (I) shall equal the sum of fifty percent (50%) of (i) plus fifty percent (50%) of (ii) where:
26 (i) is equal to the percentage determined by subtracting five and one-half percent (5.5%)
27 (the “subtrahend”) from the five-year average investment return of the retirement system
28 determined as of the last day of the plan year preceding the calendar year in which the adjustment
29 is granted, said percentage not to exceed four percent (4%) and not to be less than zero percent
30 (0%). The “five-year average investment return” shall mean the average of the investment returns
31 of the most recent five (5) plan years as determined by the retirement board. In the event the
32 retirement board adjusts the actuarially assumed rate of return for the system, either upward or
33 downward, the subtrahend shall be adjusted either upward or downward in the same amount.
34 (ii) is equal to the lesser of three percent (3%) or the percentage increase in the Consumer
LC001005 - Page 21 of 24

1 Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) as published by the U.S. Department of Labor
2 Statistics determined as of September 30 of the prior calendar year.
3 In no event shall the sum of (i) plus (ii) exceed three and one-half percent (3.5%) or be less
4 than zero percent (0%).
5 (II) is equal to the lesser of either the member’s retirement allowance or the first twenty-
6 five thousand eight hundred and fifty-five dollars ($25,855) of retirement allowance, such amount

9 retirees entitled to receive a benefit adjustment as of June 30, 2012, under the law then in effect,
10 and for all other retirees the benefit adjustments shall commence upon the third anniversary of the
11 date of retirement or the date on which the retiree reaches their Social Security retirement age,

13 5(b)(1)(A), the benefit adjustment provided by this subsection (d)(1)(B) shall commence on the

20 year shall be reduced to twenty-five percent (25%) of the benefit adjustment for each municipal

22 be funded at a funded ratio equal to or greater than eighty percent (80%) as of the end of the
23 immediately preceding plan year in accordance with the retirement system’s actuarial valuation
24 report as prepared by the system’s actuary, in which event the benefit adjustment will be reinstated
25 for all members for such plan year. Effective July 1, 2024, the funded ratio for each municipal plan
26 within the municipal employees’ retirement system, calculated by the system’s actuary, of equal to
27 or greater than eighty percent (80%) for the benefit adjustment to be reinstated for all members for

29 retirees who retired after July 1, 2012, shall receive a one-time full COLA of two and eighty-nine
30 one hundredths percent (2.89%).

32 actuary shall calculate the funding percentage after taking into account the reinstatement of any
33 current or future benefit adjustment provided under this section.
34 (3) Effective for members and/or beneficiaries of members who retired after June 30, 2012,
