THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND
Introduced By: Representatives Azzinaro, Shekarchi, Blazejewski, Chippendale,
Shallcross Smith, Abney, Read, Fellela, Fascia, and Hopkins
Date Introduced: May 01, 2025
Referred To: House read and passed
1 WHEREAS, In 1999, United States Senator John McCain introduced legislation to
2 designate May as "National Military Appreciation Month" in the United States. The resolution
3 passed overwhelmingly and since then, annually in the Month of May, we join together to thank
4 those who have served and currently serve our nation in the United States Armed Forces. We
5 recognize the sacrifice that they and their families have made on behalf of our nation and
6 solemnly honor those who fell while fighting to preserve our precious liberties and freedoms; and
7 WHEREAS, While observing National Military Appreciation Month, American citizens
8 are encouraged to come together and unify in support of our military service members, past and
9 present. To foster that sense of unity, six national observances occur every year during the month
10 of May; and
11 WHEREAS, Loyalty Day occurs every May 1st and kicks off the month-long
12 celebrations. On Loyalty Day, we reaffirm our loyalty to the United States and reflect with pride
13 on our nation's proud heritage of serving as a beacon of freedom for all of humanity; and
14 WHEREAS, Victory in Europe Day is celebrated every May 8th, in memory of the
15 surrender of Germany in World War II and in remembrance of the heroic efforts the United States
16 and its allies made to liberate Europe from the clutches of Nazi Germany; and
17 WHEREAS, Military Spouse Appreciation Day is celebrated this year on May 9th and
18 traditionally falls on the Friday before Mother's Day. On this day, we thank all of the spouses for
19 the sacrifices they make on a daily basis to keep our nation and military strong; and
1 WHEREAS, Armed Forces Day is celebrated this year on May 17th, and falls annually
2 on the third Saturday in May. On this day we give thanks to all service members who dutifully
3 serve and protect our nation in all branches of the American military; the United States Air Force,
4 United States Army, United States Coast Guard, United States Marines, and the United States
5 Navy; and
6 WHEREAS, On the last Monday in May, we remember and commemorate all of
7 America’s veterans who died while in the service of our nation. From Valley Forge to
8 Gettysburg, from the trenches in World War I to Omaha Beach, Iwo Jima, to the skies over
9 Europe and the Pacific Ocean and other battlegrounds in World War II, to the Hills of Korea, the
10 Jungles of Vietnam and the deserts of the Middle East, America has been fortunate through the
11 centuries to have so many of its citizens answer the call in preservation of our liberties, and many
12 have fallen and made the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of our nation; and
13 WHEREAS, The citizens of Rhode Island also joyously celebrate Rhode Island Military
14 Families Day every May on the Sunday after Mother's Day. On this day, we come together to
15 show appreciation for all of the sacrifices that military families, spouses and their children, make
16 in support of those who serve in our nation's Armed Forces; now, therefore be it
17 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
18 commemorates May of 2025, as "National Military Appreciation Month" in the State of Rhode
19 Island; and be it further
20 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
21 transmit duly certified copies of this resolution to the Honorable Daniel J. McKee, Governor of
22 the State of Rhode Island, and the Rhode Island Adjutant General, Brigadier General Andrew J.
