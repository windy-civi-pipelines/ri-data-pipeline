18 common-standards body or process exists and multiple conflicting sources are in use by payors and
19 providers.
20 (vi) Nothing in this section, nor in the guidelines developed, shall inhibit an individual
21 payor’s ability to employ, and not disclose to providers, temporary code edits for the purpose of
22 detecting and deterring fraudulent billing activities. The guidelines shall require that each payor

10 use to request a preauthorization, including a prospective clinical necessity review; receive an
11 authorization number; and transmit an admission notification;
12 (v) Develop and implement the use of programs that implement selective prior
13 authorization requirements, based on stratification of healthcare providers’ performance and
14 adherence to evidence-based medicine with the input of contracted healthcare providers and/or
15 provider organizations. Such criteria shall be transparent and easily accessible to contracted
16 providers. Such selective prior authorization programs shall be available when healthcare providers
17 participate directly with the insurer in risk-based payment contracts and may be available to
18 providers who do not participate in risk-based contracts;
19 (vi) Require the review of medical services, including behavioral health services, and
20 prescription drugs, subject to prior authorization on at least an annual basis, with the input of

29 websites; and
30 (B) Supporting:
31 (I) Timely submission by healthcare providers of the complete information necessary to
32 make a prior authorization determination, as early in the process as possible; and
33 (II) Timely notification of prior authorization determinations by health plans to impacted
34 health plan enrollees, and healthcare providers, including, but not limited to, ordering providers,
LC002773 - Page 16 of 23
1 and/or rendering providers, and dispensing pharmacists which may be satisfied by posting to
2 provider-accessible websites or similar electronic portals or services;
3 (viii) Increase and strengthen continuity of patient care by:
4 (A) Defining protections for continuity of care during a transition period for patients
5 undergoing an active course of treatment, when there is a formulary or treatment coverage change
6 or change of health plan that may disrupt their current course of treatment and when the treating
7 physician determines that a transition may place the patient at risk; and for prescription medication
8 by allowing a grace period of coverage to allow consideration of referred health plan options or
9 establishment of medical necessity of the current course of treatment;
10 (B) Requiring continuity of care for medical services, including behavioral health services,
11 and prescription medications for patients on appropriate, chronic, stable therapy through
12 minimizing repetitive prior authorization requirements; and which for prescription medication shall
13 be allowed only on an annual review, with exception for labeled limitation, to establish continued
14 benefit of treatment; and
15 (C) Requiring communication between healthcare providers, health plans, and patients to
16 facilitate continuity of care and minimize disruptions in needed treatment which may be satisfied

27 (c) To establish a consumer/business/labor/medical advisory council to obtain information
28 and present concerns of consumers, business, and medical providers affected by health insurance
29 decisions. The council shall develop proposals to allow the market for small business health
30 insurance to be affordable and fairer. The council shall be involved in the planning and conduct of
31 the quarterly public meetings in accordance with subsection (a). The advisory council shall develop

LC002773 - Page 11 of 23

1 relative to insurance rates of reimbursement, billing, and reimbursement procedures, and the
2 insurers’ role in promoting efficient and high-quality health care. The advisory council shall issue
3 an annual report of findings and recommendations to the governor and the general assembly and
4 present its findings at hearings before the house and senate finance committees. The advisory
5 council is to be diverse in interests and shall include representatives of community consumer
6 organizations; small businesses, other than those involved in the sale of insurance products; and
7 hospital, medical, and other health provider organizations. Such representatives shall be nominated
8 by their respective organizations. The advisory council shall be co-chaired by the health insurance

22 hospital or medical service corporations, as defined by chapters 19 and 20 of title 27, to make
23 facility-specific data and other medical service-specific data available in reasonably consistent
24 formats to patients regarding quality and costs. This information would help consumers make
25 informed choices regarding the facilities and clinicians or physician practices at which to seek care.
26 Among the items considered would be the unique health services and other public goods provided
27 by facilities and clinicians or physician practices in establishing the most appropriate cost
28 comparisons;
29 (5) All activities related to contractual disclosure to participating providers of the
30 mechanisms for resolving health plan/provider disputes;
31 (6) The uniform process being utilized for confirming, in real time, patient insurance
32 enrollment status, benefits coverage, including copays and deductibles;

7 (g) To analyze the impact of changing the rating guidelines and/or merging the individual
8 health insurance market, as defined in chapter 18.5 of title 27, and the small-employer health
9 insurance market, as defined in chapter 50 of title 27, in accordance with the following:
10 (1) The analysis shall forecast the likely rate increases required to effect the changes
11 recommended pursuant to the preceding subsection (g) in the direct-pay market and small-employer
12 health insurance market over the next five (5) years, based on the current rating structure and
13 current products.
14 (2) The analysis shall include examining the impact of merging the individual and small-
15 employer markets on premiums charged to individuals and small-employer groups.
16 (3) The analysis shall include examining the impact on rates in each of the individual and
17 small-employer health insurance markets and the number of insureds in the context of possible
18 changes to the rating guidelines used for small-employer groups, including: community rating
19 principles; expanding small-employer rate bonds beyond the current range; increasing the employer
20 group size in the small-group market; and/or adding rating factors for broker and/or tobacco use.
21 (4) The analysis shall include examining the adequacy of current statutory and regulatory
22 oversight of the rating process and factors employed by the participants in the proposed, new
23 merged market.
24 (5) The analysis shall include assessment of possible reinsurance mechanisms and/or

18 to the health and human services committees of the Rhode Island house of representatives and the
19 Rhode Island senate prior to the implementation of any such recommendations and subsequently
20 shall submit a report to the general assembly by June 30, 2024. The report shall include the
21 recommendations the commissioner may implement, with supporting rationale. The workgroup
22 shall consider and make recommendations for:

2 and benefits information;
3 (v) Recommend a standard or common process to protect all providers from the costs of
4 services to patients who are ineligible for insurance coverage in circumstances where a payor

6 request of eligibility.
7 (2) Developing implementation guidelines and promoting adoption of the guidelines for:
8 (i) The use of the National Correct Coding Initiative code-edit policy by payors and

17 reconsideration of a denial of a claim that results from differences in clinical edits where no single,
18 common-standards body or process exists and multiple conflicting sources are in use by payors and
19 providers.
20 (vi) Nothing in this section, nor in the guidelines developed, shall inhibit an individual
21 payor’s ability to employ, and not disclose to providers, temporary code edits for the purpose of
22 detecting and deterring fraudulent billing activities. The guidelines shall require that each payor
23 disclose to the provider its adjudication decision on a claim that was denied or adjusted based on

25 process to challenge the payor’s adjudication decision.
26 (vii) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to modify the rights or obligations of
27 payors or providers with respect to procedures relating to the investigation, reporting, appeal, or
28 prosecution under applicable law of potentially fraudulent billing activities.
29 (3) Developing and promoting widespread adoption by payors and providers of guidelines
30 to:

32 circumstances make it impossible for the provider to obtain a preauthorization before services are
33 performed or notify a payor within an appropriate standardized timeline of a patient’s admission;

10 use to request a preauthorization, including a prospective clinical necessity review; receive an
11 authorization number; and transmit an admission notification;
12 (v) Develop and implement the use of programs that implement selective prior
13 authorization requirements, based on stratification of healthcare providers’ performance and
14 adherence to evidence-based medicine with the input of contracted healthcare providers and/or
15 provider organizations. Such criteria shall be transparent and easily accessible to contracted
16 providers. Such selective prior authorization programs shall be available when healthcare providers
17 participate directly with the insurer in risk-based payment contracts and may be available to
18 providers who do not participate in risk-based contracts;
19 (vi) Require the review of medical services, including behavioral health services, and
20 prescription drugs, subject to prior authorization on at least an annual basis, with the input of

31 (I) Timely submission by healthcare providers of the complete information necessary to
32 make a prior authorization determination, as early in the process as possible; and
33 (II) Timely notification of prior authorization determinations by health plans to impacted
34 health plan enrollees, and healthcare providers, including, but not limited to, ordering providers,
LC002773 - Page 16 of 23

1 and/or rendering providers, and dispensing pharmacists which may be satisfied by posting to
2 provider-accessible websites or similar electronic portals or services;
3 (viii) Increase and strengthen continuity of patient care by:
4 (A) Defining protections for continuity of care during a transition period for patients
5 undergoing an active course of treatment, when there is a formulary or treatment coverage change

8 by allowing a grace period of coverage to allow consideration of referred health plan options or
9 establishment of medical necessity of the current course of treatment;
10 (B) Requiring continuity of care for medical services, including behavioral health services,
11 and prescription medications for patients on appropriate, chronic, stable therapy through
