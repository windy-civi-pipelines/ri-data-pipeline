14 offense described in this section results in the death of the animal, the person shall be punished in
15 the manner provided in § 4-1-5. If any owner, possessor, or person having the charge or custody of
16 any animal is found guilty of or pleads nolo contendere to a violation of this section and said
17 violation involves the hazardous accumulation of animals, the court shall, in imposing a penalty
18 under this section, take into account whether the defendant’s conduct could be considered to be the

8 an animal, an animal control officer shall have the authority to immediately take possession of an

10 of the animal with a notice of a hearing within forty-eight (48) hours of the seizure of the animal.
11 The municipal or district court shall have jurisdiction over these cases and expeditiously schedule
12 a hearing for a permanent rehoming of the animal upon a finding by a preponderance of the
13 evidence that there is an injury, cruelty, or neglect of an animal then the owners' rights shall be
14 terminated. The hearing in the municipal or district court can be heard prior to the disposition of
15 criminal charges.

2 agent, is aged, maimed, disabled, lame, sick, diseased, injured, unfit for the labor it is performing,
3 or cruelly treated, and shall give notice to the owner or guardian, if known. Prior to the disposition
4 of any criminal charges, the officer shall provide the animal owner with a forty-eight (48) hour

13 (c) Whenever any officer or agent of the Rhode Island Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
14 to Animals lawfully takes charge of any animal under this section, all reasonable expenses for the
15 care and treatment of the animal(s), while in the custody of the Society during this time, shall be
16 paid for by the owner or guardian. The Society has the authority to commence a civil action for
17 damages against the owner or guardian thirty (30) days after a written demand for payment of the
18 expense of the suitable care of that animal has been sent and no payment has been received. The
19 written demand shall state that the failure to pay or make arrangements to pay for the care of that
20 animal may result in forfeiture of ownership of the animal. The cost of the care and treatment that
21 is billed to the owner or guardian shall be reasonable and related to equivalent services provided
22 by veterinary care and animal sheltering, feeding, and boarding services in this state.
23 (d) The owner or guardian of any animal that is in the charge of the Rhode Island Society
24 for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals pursuant to the authority granted in this section may,
25 within sixty (60) days following the date that the society gives notice of the taking of possession of
26 the animal, petition the district court for an order to return custody of the animal to the owner or
27 guardian.
28 (e) Upon the filing of the petition, the court shall cause a summons to be issued requiring
29 an authorized representative of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to appear in
30 court at the time and place named, which summons shall be served not less than fourteen (14) days
31 before the date of the hearing.
32 (f) At the hearing on the petition, the court shall consider:
33 (1) The animal’s condition;
34 (2) The care required to maintain the animal safely and in an appropriate environment; and
LC000612 - Page 3 of 5

1 (3) The ability of the petitioner to provide or arrange for the adequate care of the animal,
2 including during the time any criminal charges related to or arising from the seizure are pending.
3 (g) If, after hearing, the court finds that the owner or guardian of the animal has the ability
4 to properly care for or arrange for the adequate care of the animal during the pendency of the
5 criminal charges, the court may allow the owner or guardian of the animal to have or arrange for
6 the adequate care, custody, and control of the animal pending the final determination of the related
7 criminal charges subject to such restrictions and conditions as the court determines to be reasonable
8 or necessary.
9 (h) All issues will be decided upon a preponderance of the evidence.
10 (i) In the event that the court orders an animal returned to the owner or guardian following
11 the hearing, the owner or guardian will not be required to pay for the cost of care incurred prior to
12 the date of the hearing unless and until such time as there has been a conviction, plea of guilty, or
13 plea of nolo contendere, of abandonment, neglect, hazardous accumulation as defined in § 4-1-1,
14 or otherwise cruel treatment in the related criminal proceeding.
15 (j) In the event that the owner or guardian fails to petition for custody of the animal within
16 sixty (60) days of notice of the taking or fails to pay within sixty (60) days of the written demand
17 for payment, the Rhode Island Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals may petition the
18 court for transfer of ownership of the animal to the Rhode Island Society for the Prevention of
19 Cruelty to Animals. If the owner or guardian fails to respond to the petition for transfer of ownership
20 the court shall transfer ownership to the society.
21 SECTION 2. This act shall take effect upon passage.
