29 implementation of the innovation plan at the school. If the school committee determines, on the
30 advice of the superintendent, that the school has not met one or more goals in the innovation plan
31 and that the failure to meet the goals may be corrected through reasonable modification of the plan,

33 assesses the implementation of the innovation plan at the school, the school committee may, on the
34 advice of the superintendent, amend the plan if the school committee determines that the
LC000343 - Page 7 of 10
1 amendment is necessary in view of subsequent changes in the district that affect one or more
2 components of the plan, including, but not limited to, changes to contracts, collective bargaining
3 agreements or school district policies; provided, however, that an amendment involving a
4 subsequent change to a teacher contract shall first be approved by teachers at the school under the
5 procedures in this chapter.
6 (d) If the school committee determines, on the advice of the superintendent, that the school
7 has substantially failed to meet multiple goals in the innovation plan, the school committee may:
8 (1) Limit one or more components of the innovation plan;
9 (2) Suspend one or more components of the innovation plan; or
10 (3) Terminate the authorization of the school; provided, however, that the limitation or
11 suspension shall not take place before the completion of the second full year of the operation of the
12 school and the termination shall not take place before the completion of the third full year of the
13 operation of the school.
14 16-77.5-7. Extension of authorization.
15 (a) At the end of the period of authorization of an innovation school approved pursuant to
16 this chapter, the leadership of the school may petition the school committee to extend the
17 authorization of the school for an additional period of not more than five (5) years. Before
18 submitting the petition, the leadership of the school shall convene a selection of school
19 stakeholders, including, but not limited to, administrators, teachers, other school staff, parents and
20 external partners, as applicable, to discuss whether the innovation plan at the school requires
21 revision and to solicit recommendations as to the potential revisions. After considering the
22 recommendations of the stakeholder group, the leadership of the school and the applicable
23 superintendent shall jointly update the innovation plan as necessary; provided, however, that a
24 proposal regarding a new waiver or exemption from the local teacher's union contract shall be
25 approved by teachers at the school. Approval of the majority of the school committee as fully
26 constituted shall be required to extend the period of authorization of an innovation school. If the
27 approval is not obtained, the leadership of the school and superintendent may jointly revise the
28 innovation plan and submit the revised plan to the school committee for a subsequent vote. If the
29 school committee does not extend the authorization of the school, the leadership of the school may
30 seek the authorization from the commission on elementary and secondary education. The
31 commission shall vote on the requested extension within sixty (60) days of its receipt for approval
32 of such extension.
33 (b) The commissioner of elementary and secondary education (the "commissioner") shall,
34 to the extent practicable, be responsible for the following:
LC000343 - Page 8 of 10

9 adopted by other public schools.
10 (c) The board of education shall promulgate rules and regulations necessary to implement
11 the provisions of this section. Annually, the commissioner shall report to the board of education,
12 the house and senate committees on education, the speaker of the house of representatives, and the

14 final vote to authorize the innovation school for a period of not more than five (5) years. Approval
15 of the majority of the school committee as fully constituted shall be required to authorize an
16 innovation school. If the approval is not obtained, an innovation plan committee may revise the
17 innovation plan and:
18 (1) In the case of a new school, submit the revised plan to the school committee for a
19 subsequent vote; or
20 (2) In the case of a conversion, submit the revised plan to the teachers in the school that is

28 determine whether the school has met the annual goals in its innovation plan and assess the
29 implementation of the innovation plan at the school. If the school committee determines, on the
30 advice of the superintendent, that the school has not met one or more goals in the innovation plan
31 and that the failure to meet the goals may be corrected through reasonable modification of the plan,
32 the school committee may amend the innovation plan as necessary. After the superintendent
33 assesses the implementation of the innovation plan at the school, the school committee may, on the
34 advice of the superintendent, amend the plan if the school committee determines that the
LC000343 - Page 7 of 10

1 amendment is necessary in view of subsequent changes in the district that affect one or more
2 components of the plan, including, but not limited to, changes to contracts, collective bargaining
3 agreements or school district policies; provided, however, that an amendment involving a
4 subsequent change to a teacher contract shall first be approved by teachers at the school under the
5 procedures in this chapter.
6 (d) If the school committee determines, on the advice of the superintendent, that the school
7 has substantially failed to meet multiple goals in the innovation plan, the school committee may:
8 (1) Limit one or more components of the innovation plan;
9 (2) Suspend one or more components of the innovation plan; or
10 (3) Terminate the authorization of the school; provided, however, that the limitation or
11 suspension shall not take place before the completion of the second full year of the operation of the
12 school and the termination shall not take place before the completion of the third full year of the
13 operation of the school.
14 16-77.5-7. Extension of authorization.
15 (a) At the end of the period of authorization of an innovation school approved pursuant to
16 this chapter, the leadership of the school may petition the school committee to extend the
17 authorization of the school for an additional period of not more than five (5) years. Before
18 submitting the petition, the leadership of the school shall convene a selection of school
19 stakeholders, including, but not limited to, administrators, teachers, other school staff, parents and
20 external partners, as applicable, to discuss whether the innovation plan at the school requires
21 revision and to solicit recommendations as to the potential revisions. After considering the
22 recommendations of the stakeholder group, the leadership of the school and the applicable
23 superintendent shall jointly update the innovation plan as necessary; provided, however, that a
24 proposal regarding a new waiver or exemption from the local teacher's union contract shall be
25 approved by teachers at the school. Approval of the majority of the school committee as fully
26 constituted shall be required to extend the period of authorization of an innovation school. If the
27 approval is not obtained, the leadership of the school and superintendent may jointly revise the
28 innovation plan and submit the revised plan to the school committee for a subsequent vote. If the
29 school committee does not extend the authorization of the school, the leadership of the school may
30 seek the authorization from the commission on elementary and secondary education. The
31 commission shall vote on the requested extension within sixty (60) days of its receipt for approval
32 of such extension.
33 (b) The commissioner of elementary and secondary education (the "commissioner") shall,
34 to the extent practicable, be responsible for the following:
