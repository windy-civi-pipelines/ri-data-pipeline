7 (b) Low-income child care. The department shall provide child care to all other working
8 families with incomes at or below two hundred sixty-one percent (261%) of the federal poverty

10 employment as defined in the department’s rules and regulations. The department shall also provide
11 child care to families with incomes below two hundred sixty-one percent (261%) of the federal
12 poverty level if, and to the extent, these families require child care to participate on a short-term

14 on-the-job training, work experience, work immersion, or other job-readiness/job-attachment
15 program sponsored or funded by the human resource investment council (governor’s workforce

17 Effective from January 1, 2021, through June 30, 2022, the department shall also provide childcare
18 assistance to families with incomes below one hundred eighty percent (180%) of the federal poverty
19 level when such assistance is necessary for a member of these families to enroll or maintain
1 enrollment in a Rhode Island public institution of higher education provided that eligibility to
2 receive funding is capped when expenditures reach $200,000 for this provision. Effective July 1,
3 2022 through December 31, 2024, the department shall also provide childcare assistance to families
4 with incomes below two hundred percent (200%) of the federal poverty level when such assistance

6 public institution of higher education. Effective January 1, 2025, the department shall also provide
7 childcare assistance to families with incomes below two hundred sixty-one percent (261%) of the

10 (c) No family/assistance unit shall be eligible for childcare assistance under this chapter if
11 the combined value of its liquid resources exceeds one million dollars ($1,000,000), which
12 corresponds to the amount permitted by the federal government under the state plan and set forth
13 in the administrative rulemaking process by the department. Liquid resources are defined as any
14 interest(s) in property in the form of cash or other financial instruments or accounts that are readily
15 convertible to cash or cash equivalents. These include, but are not limited to: cash, bank, credit
16 union, or other financial institution savings, checking, and money market accounts; certificates of
17 deposit or other time deposits; stocks; bonds; mutual funds; and other similar financial instruments
18 or accounts. These do not include educational savings accounts, plans, or programs; retirement
19 accounts, plans, or programs; or accounts held jointly with another adult, not including a spouse.
20 The department is authorized to promulgate rules and regulations to determine the ownership and
21 source of the funds in the joint account.
22 (d) As a condition of eligibility for childcare assistance under this chapter, the parent or
23 caretaker relative of the family must consent to, and must cooperate with, the department in
24 establishing paternity, and in establishing and/or enforcing child support and medical support
25 orders for any children in the family receiving appropriate child care under this section in
26 accordance with the applicable sections of title 15, as amended, unless the parent or caretaker
27 relative is found to have good cause for refusing to comply with the requirements of this subsection.
28 The parent or caretaker relative of any family applying for child care assistance may voluntarily
29 access the state's office of child support services for assistance establishing parentage, establishing
30 a child support and/or medical order, and enforcement of that order, but this shall not be a
31 requirement to qualify for or access child care assistance.
32 (e) For purposes of this section, “appropriate child care” means child care, including infant,
33 toddler, preschool, nursery school, and school-age, that is provided by a person or organization
34 qualified, approved, and authorized to provide the care by the state agency or agencies designated

7 percent (7%) of income as defined in subsection (h) of this section.
8 (2) Families who are receiving childcare assistance and who become ineligible for
9 childcare assistance as a result of their incomes exceeding two hundred sixty-one percent (261%)

12 guidelines. To be eligible, the families must continue to pay for some portion of the child care they

14 percent (7%) of income as defined in subsection (h) of this section, and in accordance with all other
15 eligibility standards.

17 take into account the cost of available childcare options; the suitability of the type of care available
18 for the child; and the parent’s preference as to the type of child care.
19 (h) For purposes of this section, “income” for families receiving cash assistance under §
20 40-5.2-11 means gross, earned income and unearned income, subject to the income exclusions in
21 §§ 40-5.2-10(g)(2) and 40-5.2-10(g)(3), and income for other families shall mean gross, earned and

29 discharged from active duty.
30 (k) Effective from August 1, 2023, through July 31, 2025, the department shall provide
