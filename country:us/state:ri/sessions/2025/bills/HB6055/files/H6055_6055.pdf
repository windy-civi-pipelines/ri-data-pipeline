16 19-14.12-4. Application to persons purporting not to be lenders.
17 If a loan exceeds the rate permitted by chapters 14.1 and 14.2 of title 19, a person shall be
18 a lender subject to the requirements of this chapter notwithstanding the fact that the person purports
19 to act as an agent or service provider or in another capacity for another entity that is exempt from
20 chapters 14.1 and 14.2 of title 19, if, among other things:
21 (1) The person holds, acquires, or maintains, directly or indirectly, the predominant

28 loan program; or
29 (3) The totality of the circumstances indicate that the person is the lender and that the
30 transaction is structured to evade the requirements of chapters 14.1 and 14.2 of title 19.
31 Circumstances that weigh in favor of a person being a lender include, without limitation, when the
32 person:
33 (i) Indemnifies, insures or protects an exempt entity from costs or risks related to the loan;
34 (ii) Predominantly designs, controls or operates the loan program;

9 19-14.12-6. Violations.

EXPLANATION
BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL
OF
A N A C T
RELATING TO COMMERCIAL LAW -- GENERAL REGULATORY PROVISIONS --
INTEREST AND USURY
***
1 This act would allow Rhode Island to opt out of the provisions of the “Depository
2 Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980” (DIDMCA), for loans made within
3 the State of Rhode Island, which allow financial institutions chartered in other states to be exempt
4 from interest rate limits which apply to financial institutions chartered in Rhode Island. This act
5 would also prevent evasion of Rhode Island’s interest rate limits and lending rules by making clear
6 that lenders, whether they identify themselves as such or not, remain bound by Rhode Island’s
7 lending laws for both small loans and loans in general.
8 This act would take effect on October 1, 2025.
