THOMAS R. DILUGLIO
Introduced By: Representatives Shekarchi, Blazejewski, J. Lombardi, Chippendale,
Newberry, Place, Paplauskas, Fellela, Tanzi, and J. Brien
Date Introduced: January 09, 2025
Referred To: House read and passed
1 WHEREAS, It is with deep sadness that this House has learned of the passing of the
2 Honorable Thomas R. DiLuglio, the esteemed and distinguished former Lieutenant Governor of
3 the State of Rhode Island. He was the beloved husband of Ann and the loving father of Thomas
4 A., Mark, Bethany, Vera, and the late Anthony; and
5 WHEREAS, Thomas R. DiLuglio was raised in Providence and graduated from Classical
6 High School. He proceeded to attend Brown University, where he was a track star of national
7 repute. A Brown University Athletics Hall of Fame Inductee, Thomas DiLuglio won the 1951 Ivy
8 League Indoor High Jump Heptagonal title, setting an Ivy League record. He won the
9 Washington Star meet twice, in 1951 and 1952 against elite competition, setting a meet record in
10 1951. Thomas DiLuglio won several New England AAU titles in the high jump, taking the indoor
11 and outdoor titles in his sophomore and junior years, as well as winning the broad jump title in
12 1952. Unfortunately, Mr. DiLuglio’s athletic career was cut short as a senior shortly after he won
13 a major event at Madison Square Garden, due to a severe back injury that later required surgery.
14 Mr. DiLuglio later attended Boston University where he earned a law degree; and
15 WHEREAS, Thomas R. DiLuglio was a “renaissance man” who was a voracious reader
16 who was widely admired and respected for his great intellect. Mr. DiLuglio was a person with
17 many talents and had a vast knowledge of, and expertise in, an array of fields of study. He was a
18 very successful prosecutor and defense attorney, and was a highly successful businessman with
19 interests in restaurants, nursing homes and the film industry, where he represented Columbia

1 Motion Pictures and served as the President of the Cinema 8 Corporation in New York State; and
2 WHEREAS, Thomas DiLuglio was also a distinguished public servant who always
3 served the people of the town of Johnston and the state of Rhode Island with tireless devotion and
4 abiding integrity. He was a State Senator from Johnston before serving as Rhode Island’s
5 Lieutenant Governor from 1977 to 1984, and later was a regular commentator on the highly
6 popular and long-running Rhode Island PBS political show, “A Lively Experiment”; and
7 WHEREAS, Thomas R. DiLuglio was held in the highest regard by all who knew him
8 and worked with him. Legendary Providence Journal reporter M. Charles Bakst described Mr.
9 DiLuglio as being “one of the brightest pols I ever covered”. He leaves an enduring legacy of
10 public service which also includes founding a state chapter of the Alzheimer’s Association,
11 creating a statewide nuclear evacuation plan, serving as a member of the Board of Directors of
12 the National Committee of the humanities, and as a member of the Rhode Island Convention
13 Center Authority, and for being a tireless advocate for Rhode Island’s economy at the local,
14 national and international levels; now, therefore be it
15 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
16 expresses its deepest condolences to the DiLuglio Family on the passing of the Honorable
17 Thomas R. DiLuglio; and be it further
18 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
19 transmit a duly certified copy of this resolution to the Ann DiLuglio and Family.
