RELATING TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS -- LICENSED ACTIVITIES
Introduced By: Representatives Kennedy, Solomon, Kazarian, Azzinaro, and Ackerman
Date Introduced: February 12, 2025
Referred To: House Corporations
(Dept. of Business Regulation)
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Chapter 19-14 of the General Laws entitled "Licensed Activities" is hereby
2 amended by adding thereto the following sections:
3 19-14-35. Information security program..
4 (a) Each licensee shall develop, implement, and maintain a comprehensive information
5 security program that is written in one or more readily accessible parts and contains administrative,
6 technical, and physical safeguards that are appropriate to the licensee’s size and complexity, the
7 nature and scope of activities, including its use of third-party service providers, and the sensitivity
8 of any customer information used by the licensee or is in the licensee’s possession.
9 (b) As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the following meanings:
10 (1) “Customer” means a consumer who has a customer relationship with a licensee.
11 (2) “Customer information” means any record containing nonpublic personal information
12 about a consumer that a licensee has a relationship with, whether in paper, electronic, or other form,
13 that is handled or maintained by or on behalf of a licensee or its affiliates.
14 (3) “Encryption” means the transformation of data into a form that results in a low
15 probability of assigning meaning without the use of a protective process or key, consistent with
16 current cryptographic standards and accompanied by appropriate safeguards for cryptographic key
17 material.
18 (4) “Information security program” means the administrative, technical, or physical
19 safeguards used to access, collect, distribute, process, protect, store, use, transmit, dispose of or

1 otherwise handle customer information.
2 (5) “Information system” means a discrete set of electronic information resources
3 organized for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition
4 of electronic information, as well as any specialized system such as industrial or process controls
5 systems, telephone switching and private branch exchange systems, and environmental controls
6 systems that contains customer information or that is connected to a system that contains customer
7 information.
8 (6) “Notification event” means acquisition of unencrypted customer information without
9 the authorization of the individual to which the information pertains. Customer information is
10 considered unencrypted for this purpose if the encryption key was accessed by an unauthorized
11 person. Unauthorized acquisition will be presumed to include unauthorized access to unencrypted
12 customer information unless reliable evidence exists that proves there has not been, or could not
13 reasonably have been, unauthorized acquisition of such information.
14 (7) “Security event” means an event resulting in unauthorized access to, or disruption or
15 misuse of, an information system or information stored on such information system, or customer
16 information held in physical form, commonly known as a “cybersecurity event”.
17 (c) In order to develop, implement, and maintain the information security program, the
18 licensee shall:
19 (1) Designate a qualified individual responsible for overseeing, implementing, and
20 enforcing the information security program. The qualified individual may be employed by the
21 licensee, an affiliate, or a service provider. To the extent the requirement in subsection (a) of this
22 section is met using a service provider or an affiliate, the licensee shall:
23 (i) Retain responsibility for compliance with this section;
24 (ii) Designate a senior member of the licensee responsible for direction and oversight of
25 the qualified individual; and
26 (iii) Require the service provider or affiliate to maintain an information security program
27 that protects the licensee in accordance with the requirements of this section.
28 (2) Perform a risk assessment that identifies reasonably foreseeable internal and external
29 risks to the security, confidentiality, and integrity of customer information that could result in the
30 unauthorized disclosure, misuse, alteration, destruction or other compromise of such information,
31 and assesses the sufficiency of any safeguards in place to control these risks.
32 (i) The risk assessment shall be written and shall include:
33 (A) Criteria for the evaluation and categorization of identified security risks or threats;
34 (B) Criteria for the assessment of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
LC001270/SUB A - Page 2 of 8

1 information systems and customer information, including the adequacy of the existing controls in
2 the context of identified risks or threats; and
3 (C) Requirements describing how identified risks will be mitigated or accepted based on
4 the risk assessment and how the information security program will address the risks.
5 (ii) A licensee shall periodically perform additional risk assessments that reexamine the
6 reasonably foreseeable internal and external risks to the security, confidentiality, and integrity of
7 customer information that could result in the unauthorized disclosure, misuse, alteration,
8 destruction or other compromise of such information, and reassess the sufficiency of any safeguards
9 in place to control these risks.
10 (3) Design and implement safeguards to control the risks identified through risk assessment
11 by:
12 (i) Implementing and periodically reviewing access controls, including technical and as
13 appropriate, physical controls to:
14 (A) Authenticate and permit access only to authorized users to protect against the
15 unauthorized acquisition of customer information; and
16 (B) Limit authorized users’ access only to customer information that they need to perform
17 their duties and functions, or in the case of customers, to access their own information;
18 (ii) Identify and manage the data, personnel, devices, systems, and facilities that enable the
19 licensee to achieve business purposes in accordance with relative importance to business objectives
20 and the licensee’s risk strategy;
21 (iii) Protect by encryption all customer information held or transmitted both in transit over
22 external networks and at rest. To the extent it is determine that encryption of customer information,
23 either in transit over external networks or at rest, is infeasible, licensee may instead secure such
24 customer information using effective alternative compensating controls reviewed and approved by
25 the qualified individual;
26 (iv) Adopt secure development practices for in-house developed applications utilized by
27 the licensee for transmitting, accessing, or storing customer information and procedures for
28 evaluating, assessing, or testing the security of externally developed applications utilized to
29 transmit, access, or store customer information;
30 (v) Implement multi-factor authentication for any individual accessing any information
31 system, unless the qualified individual has approved in writing the use of reasonably equivalent or
32 more secure access controls;
33 (vi) Record retention:
34 (A) Develop, implement, and maintain procedures for the secure disposal of customer
LC001270/SUB A - Page 3 of 8

1 information in any format no later than two (2) years after the last date the information is used in
2 connection with the provision of a product or service to the customer which relates, unless such
3 information is necessary for business operations or for other legitimate business purposes, is
4 otherwise required to be retained by law or regulation, or where targeted disposal is not reasonably
5 feasible due to the manner in which the information is maintained; and
6 (B) Periodically review data retention policies to minimize the unnecessary retention of
7 data;
8 (vii) Adopt procedures for change management; and
9 (viii) Implement policies, procedures and controls designed to monitor and log the activity
10 of authorized users and detect unauthorized access or use of, or tampering with, customer
11 information by such users.
12 (4) Based on its risk assessment, the licensee shall perform ongoing testing by:
13 (i) Regularly testing or otherwise monitoring the effectiveness of the safeguards’ key
14 controls, systems, and procedures, including those to detect actual and attempted attacks on, or
15 intrusions into, information systems;
16 (ii) For information systems, the monitoring and testing shall include continuous
17 monitoring or periodic penetration testing and vulnerability assessments. Absent effective
18 continuous monitoring or other systems to detect, on an ongoing basis, changes in information
19 systems that may create vulnerabilities, the licensee shall conduct:
20 (A) Annual penetration testing of its information systems determined each given year based
21 on relevant identified risks in accordance with the risk assessment; and
22 (B) Vulnerability assessments, including any systemic scans or reviews of information
23 systems reasonably designed to identify publicly known security vulnerabilities in the licensee’s
24 information systems based on the risk assessment, at least every six (6) months; and whenever there
25 are material changes to operations or business arrangements; and whenever there are circumstances
26 that the licensee knows or has reason to know may have a material impact on the information
27 security program.
28 (5) Implement policies and procedures to ensure that personnel have the ability to enact the
29 information security program by:
30 (i) Providing personnel with security awareness training that is updated as necessary to
31 reflect risks identified by the risk assessment;
32 (ii) Utilizing qualified information security personnel employed by the licensee or an
33 affiliate or service provider sufficient to manage information security risks and to perform or
34 oversee the information security program;
LC001270/SUB A - Page 4 of 8

1 (iii) Providing information security personnel with security updates and training sufficient
2 to address relevant security risks; and
3 (iv) Verifying that key information security personnel take steps to maintain current
4 knowledge of changing information security threats and countermeasures.
5 (6) Monitor service providers by:
6 (i) Taking reasonable steps to select and retain service providers that are capable of
7 maintaining appropriate safeguards for the customer information at issue;
8 (ii) Requiring service providers by contract to implement and maintain such safeguards;
9 and
10 (iii) Periodically assessing service providers based on the risk they present and the
11 continued adequacy of their safeguards.
12 (7) Evaluate and adjust the information security program considering the results of the
13 testing and monitoring required by subsection (c)(4) of this section; any material changes to the
14 licensee’s operations or business arrangements; the results of risk assessments performed under
15 subsection (c)(2)(ii) of this section; or any other circumstances that the licensee knows or has reason
16 to know may have a material impact on the information security program.
17 (8) Establish a written incident response plan designed to promptly respond to, and recover
18 from, any security event materially affecting the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of
19 customer information in your control. Such incident response plan shall address the following
