5 (2) Within ninety (90) days of the effective date of this chapter, the department of health
6 shall begin accepting applications for the operation of a single compassion center.
7 (3) Within one hundred fifty (150) days of the effective date of this chapter, the department

12 one applicant has applied who meets the requirements of this chapter.
13 (5) If at any time after fifteen (15) months after the effective date of this chapter, there is
