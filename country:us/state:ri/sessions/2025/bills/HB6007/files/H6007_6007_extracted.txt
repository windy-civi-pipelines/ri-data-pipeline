Referred To: House Finance
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:

2 The general assembly finds and declares as follows:
3 (1) Inflation has eroded the purchasing power of the assets held in state funds managed by
4 the state treasurer as well as state retirement funds.
5 (2) This erosion diminishes the value of Rhode Island's reserves, affecting the financial
6 stability and economic security of the state and its taxpayers and residents.
7 (3) Although the state does not have direct control over the national money supply or the
8 policies that influence inflation, the state has a duty to safeguard its financial resources against the
9 impacts of inflation and other economic uncertainties.
10 (4) Throughout its sixteen (16) year history, Bitcoin has greatly risen in value, surpassing
11 a market capitalization of two trillion dollars ($2,000,000,000,000).
12 (5) Bitcoin is becoming more widely accepted as an international medium of exchange in
13 countries around the world, including the United States.
14 (6) Bitcoin is a digital asset that can serve as a hedge against inflation by a sovereign nation
15 or an investment advisor.
16 (7) Rhode Island should have access to assets such as Bitcoin to protect against inflation.
17 (8) The purpose of this act is to authorize the state treasurer, the Rhode Island employees'
18 retirement system, the Rhode Island public school employees' retirement system, or any other state
1 retirement system to:
2 (i) Permit the inclusion of Bitcoin to serve as an asset of value and provide a hedge against
3 inflation, thus protecting the purchasing power of state funds;
4 (ii) Ensure that the investment strategies employed by the state treasurer, the Rhode Island
5 employees' retirement system, the Rhode Island public school employees' retirement system, or any
6 other state retirement system are aligned with the goal of enhancing the economic security and
7 financial resilience of Rhode Island;
8 (iii) Allow flexibility in investment decisions to respond to changing economic conditions
9 and emerging opportunities that may offer better protection or returns on state funds.
