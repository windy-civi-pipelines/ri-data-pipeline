3 medical buildings, and malls into residential units or mixed-use developments which include the
4 development of at least fifty percent (50%) of the existing gross floor area into residential units,
5 shall be a permitted use and allowed by specific and objective provisions of a zoning ordinance,
6 except where such is prohibited by environmental land use restrictions recorded on the property by
7 the state of Rhode Island department of environmental management or the United States
8 Environmental Protection Agency preventing the conversion to residential use.
9 (1) The specific zoning ordinance provisions for adaptive reuse shall exempt adaptive reuse
10 developments from off-street parking requirements of over one space per dwelling unit.
11 (2) Density.
12 (i) Co-living housing which meets the applicable requirements of the building and fire
13 codes, may be allowed in adaptive reuse developments.
14 (i)(ii) For projects that meet the following criteria, zoning ordinances shall allow for high
15 density development and shall not limit the density to less than fifteen (15) dwelling units per acre:

21 private water, such as a well and and/or wastewater treatment system(s) approved by the relevant
22 state agency for the entire development as applicable.
23 (ii)(iii) For all other adaptive reuse projects, the residential density permitted in the
24 converted structure shall be the maximum allowed that otherwise meets all standards of minimum
25 housing and has access to public sewer and water service or has access to adequate private water,
26 such as a well, and wastewater treatment system(s) approved by the relevant state agency for the
27 entire development, as applicable. The density proposed shall be determined to meet all public
28 health and safety standards.

31 additional encroachments shall be permitted into any nonconforming setback, unless otherwise
32 allowed by zoning ordinance or relief is granted by the applicable authority.
33 (4) For adaptive reuse projects, notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the
34 height of the existing structure, if it exceeds the maximum height of the zoning district, may remain
LC002157/SUB A - Page 14 of 16
1 and shall be considered legal nonconforming, and any rooftop construction shall be included within
2 the height exemption.
3 (i) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, all towns and cities may allow
4 manufactured homes that comply with § 23-27.3-109.1.3 as a type of single-family home on any
5 lot zoned for single-family use. Such home shall comply with all dimensional requirements of a

19 to which it is related.

1 (4) Adaptive reuse. “Adaptive reuse,” as defined in § 42-64.22-2.
2 (5) Aggrieved party. An aggrieved party, for purposes of this chapter, shall be:

16 (11) Building. Any structure used or intended for supporting or sheltering any use or
17 occupancy.
18 (12) Building envelope. The three-dimensional space within which a structure is permitted
19 to be built on a lot and that is defined by regulations governing building setbacks, maximum height,

22 the average, existing-grade elevation where the foundation of the structure is proposed. For an
23 existing structure, building height shall be measured from average grade taken from the outermost
24 four (4) corners of the existing foundation. In all cases, building height shall be measured to the top
25 of the highest point of the existing or proposed roof or structure. This distance shall exclude spires,
26 chimneys, flag poles, and the like. For any property or structure located in a special flood hazard
27 area, as shown on the official FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), or depicted on the

4 (14) Cluster. A site-planning technique that concentrates buildings in specific areas on the
5 site to allow the remaining land to be used for recreation, common open space, and/or preservation
6 of environmentally, historically, culturally, or other sensitive features and/or structures. The

8 are not limited to, reduction in lot areas, setback requirements, and/or bulk requirements, with the
9 resultant open land being devoted by deed restrictions for one or more uses. Under cluster

25 housing and has access to public sewer and water service or has access to adequate private water,
26 such as a well, and wastewater treatment system(s) approved by the relevant state agency for the
27 entire development, as applicable. The density proposed shall be determined to meet all public
28 health and safety standards.
