3 42-6.2-3.1. Funding for the council.
4 There is hereby established a restricted receipt account in the general fund of the state and
5 housed in the budget of the department of administration entitled “RGGI-executive climate change
6 coordinating council projects.” The express purpose of this account is to record receipts and
7 expenditures allocated pursuant to §§§ 23-82-6(a)(7), and (a)(8) 23-82-6(a)(8), 46-12.9-11(a), and
8 46-12.9-11(b). The state budget officer is hereby authorized to create restricted receipt sub-

12 the governor and general assembly within one hundred twenty (120) days of the end of each
13 calendar year how the funds were used to achieve the statutory objectives of the 2021 Act on
14 Climate.

16 entitled "Oil Spill Prevention, Administration and Response Fund" are hereby amended to read as
17 follows:
18 46-12.7-4.1. Uniform oil response and prevention fee.
19 (a) A uniform oil spill response and prevention fee in an amount not exceeding five cents

1 ($.05) for each barrel of petroleum products, as set by the director pursuant to subsection (d) of this
2 section, shall be imposed upon every person owning petroleum products at the time the petroleum
3 products are received at a marine terminal within this state by means of a vessel from a point of
4 origin outside this state. The fee shall be remitted to the division of taxation on the 30th day of each
5 month based upon the number of barrels of petroleum products received during the preceding
6 month.
7 (b) Every owner of petroleum products shall be liable for the fee until it has been paid to
8 the state, except that payment to a marine terminal operator registered under this chapter is
9 sufficient to relieve the owner from further liability for the fee; provided, however, that the fee for
10 asphalt products and asphalt derivatives shall be one cent ($.01) per barrel of asphalt products or
11 derivatives.
12 (c) Whenever the director, in consultation with the department and the division of taxation,
13 estimates that the amount in the fund will reach the amount specified in subsection (e) of this
14 section, and the money in the fund is not required for the purposes specified in § 46-12.7-5.1, the
15 director shall instruct the division of taxation to cease collecting the fee.
16 (d) The director shall set the amount of the oil spill prevention and response fees. The
17 administrator, except for the fee set out in subsection (b), shall not set the amount of the fee at less
18 than five cents ($0.05) ten cents ($0.10) for each barrel of petroleum products or crude oil, unless
19 the director finds that the assessment of a lesser fee will cause the fund to reach the designated
20 amount within six (6) months.
21 (e) For the purposes of this chapter, “designated amount” means an amount equal to ten
22 million dollars ($10,000,000), adjusted for inflation after January 1, 1998, according to an index
23 which the director may reasonably choose.
24 (f) All fees collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited in the oil spill prevention,
25 administration, and response fund, and shall be disbursed according to the purposes expressed in §
26 46-12.7-5.1.
27 (g) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (f) of this section, each July 1st, two
28 hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) of the fees collected under this section shall be
29 deposited into the coastal and estuarine habitat restoration trust fund (the “trust”).
30 46-12.7-13. Preventative uses of the fund.
31 (a) Recognizing the importance of the development of readiness and response programs,
32 the legislature may allocate not more than two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) per annum
33 of the amount then currently in the fund to be devoted to research and development in the causes,
34 effects and removal of pollution caused by oil, petroleum products and their by-products on the
