Introduced By: Representatives Diaz, Shekarchi, Blazejewski, Felix, Chippendale,
Batista, Perez, Abney, Slater, and Paplauskas
Date Introduced: April 10, 2025
Referred To: House read and passed
1 WHEREAS, It was with deep sadness and devastation that this House and the world
2 learned of the incomprehensible tragedy that unfolded in the capital City of Santo Domingo, in
3 the Dominican Republic; and
4 WHEREAS, On Tuesday, April 8th, 2025, at least 184 souls perished and 155 survivors
5 were taken to nearby hospitals when a massive collapse brought the roof down on patrons
6 innocently enjoying a concert at the Jet Set Club; and
7 WHEREAS, In the early morning hours, firefighters laboriously lifted heavy blocks of
8 broken concrete and utilized planks of wood to lift the heavy debris as the sounds of drills
9 breaking through concrete filled the air; and
10 WHEREAS, For over 12 hours, more than 300 people feverishly worked on the desperate
11 search and rescue operation, digging through mountains of rubble to rescue survivors, and a
12 specialized canine unit was brought in to help search in critical, hard-to-reach areas; and
13 WHEREAS, So many people in Rhode Island and all across New England and the
14 country have close ties with the Dominican Republic and the sons, daughters, sisters, brothers,
15 mothers, and fathers who are victims of this tragedy, and it has left profound pain and dismay in
16 all our hearts; now, therefore be it
17 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
18 extends deepest condolences to those friends and family members who lost loved ones in the Jet
19 Set Club tragedy. There are no words to adequately express our profound sadness, but know that

1 you are in the thoughts and prayers of all Rhode Islanders; and be it further
2 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
3 transmit a duly certified copy of this resolution to The Dominican Independence and Heritage
4 Award Committee of Rhode Island (DIHACRI).
