8 Accountability for Learning and Teaching” (SALT) of the board of regents for those schools and
9 school districts that continue to fall short of performance goals outlined in the district strategic
10 plans. These strategies shall initially focus on:
11 (1) technical assistance in improvement planning, curriculum alignment, student
12 assessment, instruction, and family and community involvement;
13 (2) policy support;
14 (3) resource oversight to assess and recommend that each school has adequate resources
15 necessary to meet performance goal; and
16 (4) creating supportive partnerships with education institutions, business, governmental, or
17 other appropriate nonprofit agencies. If after a three (3) year period of support there has not been
18 improvement in the education of students as determined by objective criteria to be developed by
1 the board of regents, then there shall be progressive levels of control by the department of
2 elementary and secondary education over the school and/or district budget, program, and/or
3 personnel. This control by the department of elementary and secondary education may be exercised
4 in collaboration with the school district and the municipality. If further needed, the school shall be
5 reconstituted. Reconstitution responsibility is delegated to the board of regents and may range from
6 restructuring the school’s governance, budget, program, personnel, and/or may include decisions
7 regarding the continued operation of the school. The board of regents shall assess the district’s
8 capacity and may recommend the provision of additional district, municipal and/or state resources.
9 If a school or school district is under the board of regents’ control as a result of actions taken by
10 the board pursuant to this section, the local school committee shall be responsible for funding that
11 school or school district at the same level as in the prior academic year increased by the same
12 percentage as the state total of school aid is increased.
13 (b) For FY 2007, the department shall dedicate one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000)
14 from funds appropriated to support progressive support and intervention and SALT visits to support
15 the Rhode Island Consortium for Instructional Leadership and Training. This consortium is
16 engaged in training school leaders to be more effective instructional leaders in the standards based
17 instruction environment. This intervention, support, and control by the department of elementary
18 and secondary education as authorized by this section may only be exercised in up to two (2)
19 schools within one school district at any given time. Provided, the provisions of this subsection
20 shall not apply to any such intervention, support, and control which has been initiated and is in
21 effect prior to or as of July 1, 2025.
22 SECTION 2. This act shall take effect July 1, 2025.
