16 against the applicant.
17 (k) In reviewing an application under this section, the regulatory relief office and applicable
18 agency shall consider whether a competitor to the applicant is or has been a sandbox participant
19 and, if so, weigh that as a factor in favor of allowing the applicant to also become a sandbox
20 participant.
21 (l) In reviewing an application under this section, the regulatory relief office shall consider
22 whether:
23 (1) The applicant’s plan will adequately protect consumers from potential harm identified

28 suspended even if the applicant is approved as a sandbox participant, including applicable antifraud
29 or disclosure provisions.
30 (m) An applicant becomes a sandbox participant if the regulatory relief office approves the
31 application for the regulatory sandbox and enters into a written agreement with the applicant
32 describing the specific laws and regulations that are waived or suspended as part of participation in
33 the regulatory sandbox. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the regulatory relief
34 office shall not enter into a written agreement with an applicant that waives or suspends a tax, fee,

1 or charge that is administered by the department of revenue or the division of taxation.
2 (n) The office director may deny at the office director’s sole discretion any application
3 submitted under this section for any reason, including if the office director determines that the
4 preponderance of evidence demonstrates that suspending or waiving enforcement of a law or
5 regulation would cause a significant risk of harm to consumers or residents of the state. If the office
6 director denies an application submitted under this section, the regulatory relief office shall provide
7 to the applicant a written description of the reasons for not allowing the applicant to be a sandbox
8 participant. The denial of an application submitted under this section is not subject to:
9 (1) Agency or judicial review; or
10 (2) The provisions of chapter 35 of title 42 ("administrative procedures").
11 (o) The office director shall deny an application for participation in the regulatory sandbox
12 described by this section if the applicant or any person who seeks to participate with the applicant
13 in demonstrating an offering has been convicted, entered a plea of nolo contendere, or entered a
14 plea of guilty or nolo contendere held in abeyance, for any crime involving significant theft, fraud,
15 or dishonesty if the crime bears a significant relationship to the applicant’s or other participant’s
16 ability to safely and competently participate in the regulatory sandbox program.
17 (p) When an applicant is approved for participation in the regulatory sandbox, the director
18 shall provide public notice of the approval on the office’s website and through other appropriate
19 means. The public notice shall state:
20 (1) The name of the sandbox participant;
21 (2) The industries the sandbox participant represents; and
22 (3) Each law or regulation that is suspended or waived for the sandbox participant as
23 allowed by the regulatory sandbox.
24 (q) In addition to the information described in subsection (p) of this section, the office shall
25 make the following information available on the office’s website and through other appropriate
26 means:
27 (1) Documentation regarding the office’s determination and grounds for approving each
28 sandbox participant; and
29 (2) Public notice regarding any sandbox participant’s revocation to participate in the
30 regulatory sandbox.
31 42-64.35-6. Scope of the regulatory sandbox.
32 (a) If the regulatory relief office approves an application under the provisions of this
33 chapter, the sandbox participant has twelve (12) months after the day on which the application was
34 approved to demonstrate the offering described in the sandbox participant’s application.
LC001748 - Page 9 of 15

1 (b) An offering that is demonstrated within the regulatory sandbox is subject to the
2 following:
3 (1) Each consumer shall be a resident of the state; and
4 (2) No law or regulation may be waived or suspended if waiving or suspending the law or
5 regulation would prevent a consumer from seeking restitution in the event that the consumer is
6 harmed.
7 (c) This section does not restrict a sandbox participant who holds a license or other
8 authorization in another jurisdiction from acting in accordance with that license or other
9 authorization.
10 (d) A sandbox participant is deemed to possess an appropriate license or other authorization
11 under the laws of the state for the purposes of any provision of federal law requiring licensure or
12 other authorization by the state.
13 (e) Subject to subsection (f) of this section:
14 (1) During the demonstration period, a sandbox participant is not subject to the
15 enforcement of state laws or regulations identified in the written agreement between the regulatory
16 relief office and the sandbox participant;
17 (2) The department of the attorney general shall not file or pursue charges pertaining to a
18 law or regulation identified in the written agreement between the regulatory relief office and the
19 sandbox participant that occurs during the demonstration period; and
20 (3) A state agency shall not file or pursue any punitive action against a sandbox participant,
21 including a fine or license suspension or revocation, for the violation of a law or regulation that:
22 (i) Is identified as being waived or suspended in the written agreement between the
23 regulatory relief office and the sandbox participant; and
24 (ii) Occurs during the demonstration period.
25 (f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section:

27 committed during the sandbox participant’s participation in the regulatory sandbox; and

29 shall comply with all applicable federal laws and regulations governing consumer protection.
30 (g) By written notice, the regulatory relief office may end a sandbox participant’s
31 participation in the regulatory sandbox at any time and for any reason, including if the office
32 director determines that a sandbox participant is not operating in good faith to bring an offering to
33 market.
