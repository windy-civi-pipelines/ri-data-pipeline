13 project cost requirement.
14 (c) The commerce corporation shall develop separate, streamlined application processes
15 for the issuance of rebuild RI tax credits for each of the following:

2 allowed in addition to the maximum project credit for which said project is eligible.
3 (g) Credits available under this chapter shall not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the project
4 cost, provided, however, that the applicant shall be eligible for additional tax credits of not more

17 Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design or other equivalent standards.
18 (h) Maximum aggregate credits. The aggregate sum authorized pursuant to this chapter,
19 inclusive of any sales and use tax exemptions allowed pursuant to this chapter, shall not exceed
20 two hundred twenty-five million dollars ($225,000,000), excluding any tax credits allowed
21 pursuant to subsection (f)(3) of this section and sales and use tax exemptions allowed pursuant to
22 subsection (f)(4) of this section.
23 (i) Tax credits shall not be allowed under this chapter prior to the taxable year in which the
24 project is placed in service.
25 (j) The amount of a tax credit allowed under this chapter shall be allowable to the taxpayer
26 in up to five, annual increments; no more than thirty percent (30%) and no less than fifteen percent
27 (15%) of the total credits allowed to a taxpayer under this chapter may be allowable for any taxable
28 year.
29 (k) If the portion of the tax credit allowed under this chapter exceeds the taxpayer’s total
30 tax liability for the year in which the relevant portion of the credit is allowed, the amount that
31 exceeds the taxpayer’s tax liability may be carried forward for credit against the taxes imposed for
32 the succeeding four (4) years, or until the full credit is used, whichever occurs first. Credits allowed
33 to a partnership, a limited liability company taxed as a partnership, or multiple owners of property

4 (l) The commerce corporation, in consultation with the division of taxation, shall establish,
5 by regulation, the process for the assignment, transfer, or conveyance of tax credits.
6 (m) For purposes of this chapter, any assignment or sales proceeds received by the taxpayer
7 for its assignment or sale of the tax credits allowed pursuant to this section shall be exempt from
8 taxation under title 44. If a tax credit is subsequently revoked or adjusted, the seller’s tax calculation
9 for the year of revocation or adjustment shall be increased by the total amount of the sales proceeds,
10 without proration, as a modification under chapter 30 of title 44. In the event that the seller is not a
11 natural person, the seller’s tax calculation under chapter 11, 13, 14, or 17 of title 44, as applicable,
12 for the year of revocation, or adjustment, shall be increased by including the total amount of the
13 sales proceeds without proration.
14 (n) The tax credit allowed under this chapter may be used as a credit against corporate
15 income taxes imposed under chapter 11, 13, 14, or 17 of title 44, or may be used as a credit against
16 personal income taxes imposed under chapter 30 of title 44 for owners of pass-through entities such
17 as a partnership, a limited liability company taxed as a partnership, or multiple owners of property.
18 (o) In the case of a corporation, this credit is only allowed against the tax of a corporation
19 included in a consolidated return that qualifies for the credit and not against the tax of other
20 corporations that may join in the filing of a consolidated tax return.
21 (p) Upon request of a taxpayer and subject to annual appropriation, the state shall redeem
22 this credit, in whole or in part, for ninety percent (90%) of the value of the tax credit. The division
23 of taxation, in consultation with the commerce corporation, shall establish by regulation a
24 redemption process for tax credits.
25 (q) Projects eligible to receive a tax credit under this chapter may, at the discretion of the
