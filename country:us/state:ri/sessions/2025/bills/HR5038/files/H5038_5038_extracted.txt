Date Introduced: January 14, 2025
Referred To: House read and passed
1 WHEREAS, It is with sadness that this House has learned of the passing of Judge
2 Edward Clark Parker, a widely admired member of the State Traffic Tribunal and a devoted
3 family man. He was the beloved husband of Martha Kenney Parker for 59 years, and the father
4 of Edward Parker II, and his wife, Bethany, Jocelyn Parker and her husband, Thomas, his
5 daughter-in-law, Jennifer, and the late John Parker. He was also the very proud grandfather of
6 Chelsea, Emily, Teddy, and Ryan; and
7 WHEREAS, Affectionately known as “Eddie” by his family and many friends, Judge
8 Parker was the son of the late Edward and Catherine Clark Parker. He was a lifelong resident of
9 the City of Pawtucket, was a graduate of St. Raphael School, and earned his Bachelor’s degree
10 from Boston College, from which he remained a “devoted alum and avid Eagles fan” throughout
11 his life. He earned his Juris Doctor from New England School of Law, and for six years, had
12 honorably served our country in the Army Reserve; and
13 WHEREAS, For many years, Judge Parker maintained a flourishing private law practice,
14 Keough, Parker & Gearon, and later served as the Deputy Attorney General of Rhode Island from
15 1987 to 1993; and
16 WHEREAS, In 1993, the Honorable Edward Clark Parker was appointed to the bench,
17 where he served the people of Rhode Island on the State Traffic Tribunal for three decades, until
18 his retirement in 2022. In 2007, he served as the Tribunal’s interim chief, and over the course of
19 his long and distinguished career, had also been Vice-Chair of the Pawtucket Housing Authority,
1 and Executive Director of the State’s Fire Safety Code Board; and
2 WHEREAS, In addition to his family and career, Judge Parker enjoyed “playing golf
3 with his friends in the A-train at Pawtucket Country Club” where he had been a member for 61
4 years, was a member of the Sons of the Irish Kings, and was an avid reader who was never at a
5 loss for telling a good story or two; and
6 WHEREAS, Judge Parker possessed a “keen intellect”, “quick witted-humor” and a fair
7 and magnanimous spirit. He had the love of his family and friends and the admiration of his
8 peers, and he will be profoundly missed by those who had the good fortune to be a part of his
9 vital and fulfilling life; now, therefore be it
10 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
11 expresses our deepest sympathies on the passing of the Honorable Edward Clark Parker. He will
12 forever be remembered as a highly respected and admired judge who presided with fairness and
13 justice, and served the people of Rhode Island with integrity and excellence; and be it further
14 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
15 transmit a duly certified copy of this resolution to Martha Kenney Parker and Family.
