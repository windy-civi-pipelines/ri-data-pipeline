RELATING TO STATE AFFAIRS AND GOVERNMENT -- THE HEALTHCARE SERVICES
FUNDING PLAN ACT
Introduced By: Senators DiMario, DiPalma, Sosnowski, Gallo, Lawson, Bissaillon,
Mack, Thompson, Murray, and Acosta
Date Introduced: February 10, 2025
Referred To: Senate Health & Human Services
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Section 42-7.4-3 of the General Laws in Chapter 42-7.4 entitled "The
2 Healthcare Services Funding Plan Act" is hereby amended to read as follows:
3 42-7.4-3. Imposition of healthcare services funding contribution. [As enacted in 2014.]
4 (a) Each insurer is required to pay the healthcare services funding contribution for each
5 contribution enrollee of the insurer at the time the contribution is calculated and paid, at the rate set
6 forth in this section.
7 (1) Beginning January 1, 2016 July 1, 2025, the secretary shall set the healthcare services
8 funding contribution each fiscal year in an amount equal to: (i) The child immunization funding
9 requirement described in § 23-1-46; plus (ii) The adult immunization funding requirement
10 described in § 23-1-46; plus (iii) The children’s health services funding requirement described in §
11 42-12-29; plus (iv) The psychiatry resource network funding requirement described in § 23-1-46.2
12 and all as divided by; (iv)(v) The number of contribution enrollees of all insurers.
13 (2) The contribution set forth herein shall be in addition to any other fees or assessments
14 upon the insurer allowable by law.
15 (b) The contribution shall be paid by the insurer; provided, however, a person providing
16 health benefits coverage on a self-insurance basis that uses the services of a third-party
17 administrator shall not be required to make a contribution for a contribution enrollee where the
18 contribution on that enrollee has been or will be made by the third-party administrator.

1 (c) The secretary shall create a process to facilitate the transition to the healthcare services
2 funding contribution method that: (i) assures adequate funding beginning July 1, 2016, (ii) reflects
3 that funding via the healthcare services funding contribution method initially will be for only a
4 portion of the state’s fiscal year, and (iii) avoids duplicate liability for any insurer that made a
5 payment under the premium assessment method in effect prior to January 1, 2016, for a period for
6 which it would also be liable for a contribution under the healthcare services funding contribution
7 method as described in this chapter.
8 SECTION 2. Chapter 23-1 of the General Laws entitled "Department of Health" is hereby
9 amended by adding thereto the following section:
10 23-1-46.2. Psychiatry resource network account.

13 coverage for the following services: Existing Rhode Island lines including the PediPRN and
14 MomsPRN information lines which are available to providers or residents in the state, and which
15 are funded pursuant to regulation adopted by the director of the department of health. Amounts
16 collected pursuant to § 42-7.4-3(a)(1)(iv) shall be collected by the department of health and
17 deposited in the "PRN account." The funds shall be used solely for the purposes of the "PRN
18 account," and no other.
19 (b) Each year's psychiatry resource network funding requirement in § 42-7.4-3(a)(1)(iv)
20 shall be the amount projected by the department of health in subsection (a) of this section less any
21 projected carryover of excess funds from prior assessments, grants, or other funding and approved
22 by the PRN advisory committee.
23 (c) The department of health shall establish a PRN advisory committee, as determined by
24 the director of the department of health, that shall include, but not be limited to, representatives
25 from the department of health; the office of the health insurance commissioner; the executive office
26 of health and human services; the department of behavioral healthcare, developmental disabilities,
27 and hospitals; insurers; and other representatives as indicated.
28 (d) The department of health shall submit to the general assembly an annual report on the
29 program and costs related to the program, on or before February 1 of each year. The department
30 shall make available to each insurer required to make a contribution pursuant to § 42-7.4-3, upon
31 its request, detailed information regarding the programs described in subsection (a) of this section
32 and the costs related to those programs
33 (e) The "PRN account" shall be exempt from the indirect costs recovery provisions of §
34 35-4-27.

7 shall be no transfer from cash receipts with restrictions received exclusively: (1) From contributions
8 from nonprofit charitable organizations; (2) From the assessment of indirect cost-recovery rates on
