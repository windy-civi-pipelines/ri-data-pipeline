4 understand the components of their utility bills including, but not limited to, supply charges,
5 delivery charges, and any public policy costs related to renewable energy and public benefits
6 programs. To further these goals, it is imperative that utility companies provide detailed
7 breakdowns of these charges in an easily understandable manner on each bill.
8 SECTION 2. Title 39 of the General Laws entitled "PUBLIC UTILITIES AND
9 CARRIERS" is hereby amended by adding thereto the following chapter:
10 CHAPTER 36

12 (1) Supply charges. A clear itemization of the charges for electricity and gas supply,
13 including a separate line item indicating the portion of the supply charge attributable to each
14 renewable energy source, broken down by wind, solar, hydro, geothermal, and any other renewable
15 sources, utilized by the utility to meet the customer’s needs.
16 (2) Delivery charges. A separate line item indicating the charges for the delivery of
17 electricity or gas to the customer’s premises.

20 (hereinafter referred to in this chapter as “RECs”), energy efficiency programs, and other programs
21 related to state or federal renewable energy mandates.
22 (4) Breakdown of renewable energy mandates. A further itemization within the supply
23 charges to indicate the costs associated with specific renewable energy mandates. Each renewable
24 energy mandate should be individually identified with an associated cost breakdown including, but
25 not limited to:
26 (i) Wind energy mandates;
27 (ii) Solar energy mandates;
28 (iii) Hydro energy mandates;
29 (iv) Geothermal energy mandates; or
30 (v) Any other renewable energy mandates.
31 (b) The bill shall provide an explanation of how the customer’s costs for each renewable
32 energy source are determined, including the methodology used to allocate these costs and the
33 percentage of the customer’s supply charge attributed to each renewable energy source.
34 (c) The utility shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that this breakdown is presented in a
LC001883 - Page 2 of 4
1 user-friendly format that is easily readable and comprehensible to a typical residential or
2 commercial customer.
3 39-36-4. Public comment and review.
4 (a) Beginning on January 1, 2026, each utility shall submit to the public utilities
5 commission (“PUC”) a proposed plan for the implementation of the bill breakdown requirements

25 service announcements, educational materials, and online resources.
26 (b) The PUC shall provide utilities with guidance and resources on best practices for
27 explaining the new breakdown of charges to customers, particularly focusing on the renewable
