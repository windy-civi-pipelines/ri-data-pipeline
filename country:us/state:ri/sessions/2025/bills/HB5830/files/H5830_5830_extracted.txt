14 whom such covered entity has actual knowledge, or willfully disregards is a child shall use
15 reasonable care to avoid any heightened risk of harm to children caused by such online service,
16 product or feature. In any enforcement action brought by the attorney general pursuant to § 6-48.2-
17 7, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that a covered entity used reasonable care as required

31 that is reasonably likely to be accessed by children and maintain documentation of the data
32 protection impact assessment for as long as the online service, product, or feature is reasonably
33 known to be used by children. The data protection impact assessment shall consist of a systematic
34 survey to assess compliance with the duty to use reasonable care to avoid any heightened risk of
LC001708 - Page 5 of 11
1 harm to known children and shall include a plan to ensure that all online products, services, or
2 features provided by the covered entity and known to be used by children are designed and offered
3 in a manner consistent with the duty to use reasonable care to avoid any heightened risk of harm to
4 known children. The plan shall include a description of steps the covered entity has taken and shall
5 take to comply with the duty to use reasonable care to avoid any heightened risk of harm to known
6 children.
7 (2) Review and modify all data protection impact assessments as necessary to account for
8 material changes to processing pertaining to the online service, product, or feature within ninety
9 (90) days after any material changes.

15 general may, in the attorney general’s discretion, extend beyond seven (7) days the amount of time
16 allowed for a covered entity to produce a data protection impact assessment.
17 (5) Configure all default privacy settings provided to known children by the online service,
18 product, or feature to settings that offer a high level of privacy, unless the covered entity can
19 demonstrate a compelling reason that a different setting is consistent with the duty to use reasonable
20 care to avoid any heightened risk of harm to children, as defined pursuant to the provisions of § 6-
21 48.2-3(b).
22 (6) Provide any privacy information, terms of service, policies, and community standards
23 concisely, prominently, and using clear language suited to the age of children known to access that
24 online service, product, or feature.
25 (7) Provide prominent, accessible, and responsive tools to assist known children in a form
26 or manner required by the general attorney, or, if applicable, their parents or guardians, in the
27 exercise of their privacy rights and to report concerns.
28 (b) A data protection impact assessment required by this section shall:
29 (1) Identify the purpose of the online service, product, or feature;
30 (2) Disclose how it uses children’s personal data; and
31 (3) Determine whether the online service, product, or feature is designed and offered in a
32 manner consistent with the duty to use reasonable care to avoid any heightened risk of harm to

34 (i) Whether the design of the online service, product, or feature is reasonably expected to
LC001708 - Page 6 of 11
1 allow known children to be party to or exploited by a contract on the online service, product, or
2 feature that would result in reasonably foreseeable and material financial harm to the child; a highly
3 offensive intrusion on the reasonable privacy expectations of the child; or discrimination against
4 the child based upon race, color, religion, national origin, disability, sex, sexual orientation, or
5 gender identity or expression;
6 (ii) Whether targeted advertising systems used by the online service, product, or feature
7 would result in reasonably foreseeable and material financial harm to the known child; a highly
8 offensive intrusion on the reasonable privacy expectations of the child; or discrimination against
9 the child based upon race, color, religion, national origin, disability, sex, sexual orientation, or
10 gender identity or expression;
11 (iii) Whether the online service, product, or feature uses system design features to increase,
12 sustain, or extend use of the online service, product, or feature by known children, including the
13 automatic playing of media, rewards for time spent, and notifications, that would result in
14 reasonably foreseeable and material financial harm to the child or a highly offensive intrusion on
15 the reasonable privacy expectations of the child; or discrimination against the child based upon
16 race, color, religion, national origin, disability, sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity or
17 expression;
18 (iv) Whether, how, and for what purpose the online product, service, or feature collects or
19 processes personal data of known children and whether those practices would result in reasonably
20 foreseeable and material financial harm to the child; a highly offensive intrusion on the reasonable
21 privacy expectations of the child; or discrimination against the child based upon race, color,
22 religion, national origin, disability, sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity or expression; and
23 (v) Whether and how product experimentation results for the online product, service, or
24 feature reveal data management or design practices that would result in reasonably foreseeable and
25 material financial harm to the known child; a highly offensive intrusion on the reasonable privacy
26 expectations of the child; or discrimination against the child based upon race, color, religion,
27 national origin, disability, sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity or expression.
28 (c) A data protection impact assessment conducted by a covered entity for the purpose of
29 compliance with any other law may be utilized to comply with the provisions of this chapter if the
30 data protection impact assessment meets the requirements of this chapter.
31 (d) A single data protection impact assessment may contain multiple similar processing
32 operations that present similar risk only if each relevant online service, product, or feature is
33 addressed separately.
34 (e) A covered entity may process only the personal data reasonably necessary to provide
LC001708 - Page 7 of 11
1 an online service, product, or feature with which a child is actively and knowingly engaged to
2 estimate age.
3 (f) A data protection impact assessment created pursuant to this section is exempt from
4 public disclosure and to the extent required to be disclosed to public officials shall not constitute a
5 public record pursuant to the provisions of chapter 2 of title 38 (“access to public records”).
6 6-48.2-5. Covered entity prohibitions.
7 A covered entity that provides an online service, product, or feature to known children shall
8 not:
9 (1) Process the personal data of any known child in a way that is inconsistent with the duty
10 to use reasonable care to avoid any heightened risk of harm to children, as defined pursuant to the
11 provisions of § 6-48.2-3(b);
12 (2) Profile a known child by default unless both of the following criteria are met:
13 (i) The covered entity can demonstrate it has appropriate safeguards in place to ensure that
14 profiling is consistent with the duty to use reasonable care to avoid any heightened risk of harm to
15 known children; and
16 (ii) Profiling is necessary to provide the online service, product, or feature requested and
17 only with respect to the aspects of the online service, product, or feature with which a known child
18 is actively and knowingly engaged;
19 (3) Process any personal data that is not reasonably necessary to provide an online service,
20 product, or feature with which a known child is actively and knowingly engaged;
21 (4) If the end user is a known child, process personal data for any reason other than a reason
22 for which that personal data was collected;
23 (5) Process any precise geolocation information of known children by default, unless the
24 collection of that precise geolocation information is strictly necessary for the covered entity to
25 provide the service, product, or feature requested and then only for the limited time that the
26 collection of precise geolocation information is necessary to provide the service, product, or
27 feature;
28 (6) Process any precise geolocation information of a known child without providing a
29 conspicuous sign to the child for the duration of that collection that precise geolocation information
30 is being collected;
31 (7) Use dark patterns to cause known children to provide personal data beyond what is
32 reasonably expected to provide that online service, product, or feature to forego privacy protections,
33 or to take any action that the covered entity knows, or has reason to know, is not consistent with
34 the duty to use reasonable care to avoid any heightened risk of harm to children; or
LC001708 - Page 8 of 11
1 (8) Allow a known child’s parent or any other consumer to monitor the child’s online
2 activity or track the child’s location, without providing a conspicuous signal to the child when the
3 child is being monitored or tracked.

5 (a) A data protection impact assessment collected or maintained by the attorney general
6 pursuant to this chapter shall not be deemed public for purposes of chapter 2 of title 38 ("access to
7 public records").
8 (b) To the extent any information contained in a data protection impact assessment
9 disclosed to the attorney general includes information subject to attorney-client privilege or work
10 product protection, disclosure pursuant to this chapter does not constitute a waiver of that privilege
11 or protection.
12 6-48.2-7. Enforcement.
13 (a) The attorney general may seek the imposition of an injunction and a civil penalty of not
14 more than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) per affected child for each negligent violation

16 for each intentional violation of this chapter, plus costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees for each
17 violation.
18 (b) Any penalties, fees, and expenses recovered in an action brought under this chapter
19 shall be deposited in a restricted receipt account and are to be appropriated to the attorney general
20 and utilized pursuant to the provisions of subsection (c) of this section.

22 (b) of this section shall be placed into a restricted receipt account to support the personnel costs,
23 operating costs and capital expenditure necessary to carry out the enforcement provisions of this
24 section; provided, however, that any fees charged shall be in addition to and not substituted for
25 funds appropriated for the office by the state or federal government.
26 (d) If a covered entity is in substantial compliance with the requirements of this chapter,
27 the attorney general shall, before initiating a civil action pursuant to the provisions of this chapter,
28 provide written notice to the covered entity identifying the specific provisions of this chapter that
29 the attorney general alleges have been or are being violated. If a covered entity satisfies the
30 provisions of § 6-48.2-4 before offering any new online product, service, or feature reasonably
31 likely to be accessed by children to the public, the covered entity shall have ninety (90) days to
32 fully comply with all provisions specified in the notice from the attorney general. If the covered
33 entity cures all noticed violations and provides the attorney general a written statement that the
34 alleged violations have been cured, and sufficient measures have been taken to prevent future
LC001708 - Page 9 of 11
1 violations, the covered entity shall not be liable for a civil penalty for any violation cured within
2 the ninety (90) day period.
3 (e) No individual entitlement or private right of action is created by this section.
4 SECTION 2. This act shall take effect on January 1, 2026.

12 6-48.2-3. Heightened risk of harm to children -- Presumption -- Definitions.
13 (a) Each covered entity that offers any online service, product or feature to a consumer
14 whom such covered entity has actual knowledge, or willfully disregards is a child shall use
15 reasonable care to avoid any heightened risk of harm to children caused by such online service,
16 product or feature. In any enforcement action brought by the attorney general pursuant to § 6-48.2-
17 7, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that a covered entity used reasonable care as required

19 protection assessments.
20 (b) As used in this chapter, “heightened risk of harm to children” means processing known
21 children’s personal data in a manner that presents any reasonably foreseeable risk of:

30 (1) Complete a data protection impact assessment for an online service, product, or feature
31 that is reasonably likely to be accessed by children and maintain documentation of the data
32 protection impact assessment for as long as the online service, product, or feature is reasonably
33 known to be used by children. The data protection impact assessment shall consist of a systematic
34 survey to assess compliance with the duty to use reasonable care to avoid any heightened risk of
LC001708 - Page 5 of 11

1 harm to known children and shall include a plan to ensure that all online products, services, or
2 features provided by the covered entity and known to be used by children are designed and offered
3 in a manner consistent with the duty to use reasonable care to avoid any heightened risk of harm to
4 known children. The plan shall include a description of steps the covered entity has taken and shall
5 take to comply with the duty to use reasonable care to avoid any heightened risk of harm to known
6 children.
7 (2) Review and modify all data protection impact assessments as necessary to account for
8 material changes to processing pertaining to the online service, product, or feature within ninety
9 (90) days after any material changes.

14 the attorney general with a copy of a data protection impact assessment; provided that, the attorney
15 general may, in the attorney general’s discretion, extend beyond seven (7) days the amount of time
16 allowed for a covered entity to produce a data protection impact assessment.
17 (5) Configure all default privacy settings provided to known children by the online service,
18 product, or feature to settings that offer a high level of privacy, unless the covered entity can
19 demonstrate a compelling reason that a different setting is consistent with the duty to use reasonable
20 care to avoid any heightened risk of harm to children, as defined pursuant to the provisions of § 6-
21 48.2-3(b).
22 (6) Provide any privacy information, terms of service, policies, and community standards
23 concisely, prominently, and using clear language suited to the age of children known to access that
24 online service, product, or feature.
25 (7) Provide prominent, accessible, and responsive tools to assist known children in a form
26 or manner required by the general attorney, or, if applicable, their parents or guardians, in the
27 exercise of their privacy rights and to report concerns.
28 (b) A data protection impact assessment required by this section shall:
29 (1) Identify the purpose of the online service, product, or feature;
30 (2) Disclose how it uses children’s personal data; and
31 (3) Determine whether the online service, product, or feature is designed and offered in a
32 manner consistent with the duty to use reasonable care to avoid any heightened risk of harm to

34 (i) Whether the design of the online service, product, or feature is reasonably expected to
LC001708 - Page 6 of 11

1 allow known children to be party to or exploited by a contract on the online service, product, or
2 feature that would result in reasonably foreseeable and material financial harm to the child; a highly
3 offensive intrusion on the reasonable privacy expectations of the child; or discrimination against
4 the child based upon race, color, religion, national origin, disability, sex, sexual orientation, or
5 gender identity or expression;
6 (ii) Whether targeted advertising systems used by the online service, product, or feature
7 would result in reasonably foreseeable and material financial harm to the known child; a highly
8 offensive intrusion on the reasonable privacy expectations of the child; or discrimination against
9 the child based upon race, color, religion, national origin, disability, sex, sexual orientation, or
10 gender identity or expression;
11 (iii) Whether the online service, product, or feature uses system design features to increase,
12 sustain, or extend use of the online service, product, or feature by known children, including the
13 automatic playing of media, rewards for time spent, and notifications, that would result in
14 reasonably foreseeable and material financial harm to the child or a highly offensive intrusion on
15 the reasonable privacy expectations of the child; or discrimination against the child based upon
16 race, color, religion, national origin, disability, sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity or
17 expression;
18 (iv) Whether, how, and for what purpose the online product, service, or feature collects or
19 processes personal data of known children and whether those practices would result in reasonably
20 foreseeable and material financial harm to the child; a highly offensive intrusion on the reasonable
21 privacy expectations of the child; or discrimination against the child based upon race, color,
22 religion, national origin, disability, sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity or expression; and
23 (v) Whether and how product experimentation results for the online product, service, or
24 feature reveal data management or design practices that would result in reasonably foreseeable and
25 material financial harm to the known child; a highly offensive intrusion on the reasonable privacy
26 expectations of the child; or discrimination against the child based upon race, color, religion,
27 national origin, disability, sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity or expression.
28 (c) A data protection impact assessment conducted by a covered entity for the purpose of
29 compliance with any other law may be utilized to comply with the provisions of this chapter if the
30 data protection impact assessment meets the requirements of this chapter.
31 (d) A single data protection impact assessment may contain multiple similar processing
32 operations that present similar risk only if each relevant online service, product, or feature is
33 addressed separately.
34 (e) A covered entity may process only the personal data reasonably necessary to provide
LC001708 - Page 7 of 11

1 an online service, product, or feature with which a child is actively and knowingly engaged to
2 estimate age.
3 (f) A data protection impact assessment created pursuant to this section is exempt from
4 public disclosure and to the extent required to be disclosed to public officials shall not constitute a
5 public record pursuant to the provisions of chapter 2 of title 38 (“access to public records”).
6 6-48.2-5. Covered entity prohibitions.
7 A covered entity that provides an online service, product, or feature to known children shall
8 not:
9 (1) Process the personal data of any known child in a way that is inconsistent with the duty
10 to use reasonable care to avoid any heightened risk of harm to children, as defined pursuant to the
11 provisions of § 6-48.2-3(b);
12 (2) Profile a known child by default unless both of the following criteria are met:

14 profiling is consistent with the duty to use reasonable care to avoid any heightened risk of harm to
15 known children; and
16 (ii) Profiling is necessary to provide the online service, product, or feature requested and
17 only with respect to the aspects of the online service, product, or feature with which a known child
18 is actively and knowingly engaged;
19 (3) Process any personal data that is not reasonably necessary to provide an online service,
20 product, or feature with which a known child is actively and knowingly engaged;
21 (4) If the end user is a known child, process personal data for any reason other than a reason
22 for which that personal data was collected;
23 (5) Process any precise geolocation information of known children by default, unless the
24 collection of that precise geolocation information is strictly necessary for the covered entity to
25 provide the service, product, or feature requested and then only for the limited time that the
26 collection of precise geolocation information is necessary to provide the service, product, or
27 feature;
28 (6) Process any precise geolocation information of a known child without providing a
29 conspicuous sign to the child for the duration of that collection that precise geolocation information
30 is being collected;
31 (7) Use dark patterns to cause known children to provide personal data beyond what is
32 reasonably expected to provide that online service, product, or feature to forego privacy protections,
33 or to take any action that the covered entity knows, or has reason to know, is not consistent with
34 the duty to use reasonable care to avoid any heightened risk of harm to children; or
LC001708 - Page 8 of 11

1 (8) Allow a known child’s parent or any other consumer to monitor the child’s online

5 (a) A data protection impact assessment collected or maintained by the attorney general
6 pursuant to this chapter shall not be deemed public for purposes of chapter 2 of title 38 ("access to
7 public records").
8 (b) To the extent any information contained in a data protection impact assessment
9 disclosed to the attorney general includes information subject to attorney-client privilege or work
10 product protection, disclosure pursuant to this chapter does not constitute a waiver of that privilege
11 or protection.
12 6-48.2-7. Enforcement.
13 (a) The attorney general may seek the imposition of an injunction and a civil penalty of not
14 more than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) per affected child for each negligent violation

16 for each intentional violation of this chapter, plus costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees for each
17 violation.
18 (b) Any penalties, fees, and expenses recovered in an action brought under this chapter
19 shall be deposited in a restricted receipt account and are to be appropriated to the attorney general
20 and utilized pursuant to the provisions of subsection (c) of this section.

22 (b) of this section shall be placed into a restricted receipt account to support the personnel costs,
23 operating costs and capital expenditure necessary to carry out the enforcement provisions of this
24 section; provided, however, that any fees charged shall be in addition to and not substituted for
25 funds appropriated for the office by the state or federal government.
26 (d) If a covered entity is in substantial compliance with the requirements of this chapter,
27 the attorney general shall, before initiating a civil action pursuant to the provisions of this chapter,
28 provide written notice to the covered entity identifying the specific provisions of this chapter that
29 the attorney general alleges have been or are being violated. If a covered entity satisfies the
30 provisions of § 6-48.2-4 before offering any new online product, service, or feature reasonably
31 likely to be accessed by children to the public, the covered entity shall have ninety (90) days to
32 fully comply with all provisions specified in the notice from the attorney general. If the covered
33 entity cures all noticed violations and provides the attorney general a written statement that the
34 alleged violations have been cured, and sufficient measures have been taken to prevent future
LC001708 - Page 9 of 11

1 violations, the covered entity shall not be liable for a civil penalty for any violation cured within
2 the ninety (90) day period.
