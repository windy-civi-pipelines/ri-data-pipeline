PROCLAIMING MARCH 17, 2025, TO BE "PROFOUND AUTISM DAY IN RHODE
ISLAND"
Introduced By: Senators Kallman, LaMountain, Felag, Murray, Euer, Rogers, Zurier,
Acosta, Ujifusa, and Lauria
Date Introduced: March 18, 2025
Referred To: Recommended for Immediate Consideration
1 WHEREAS, Profound Autism refers to a subset of individuals with Autism Spectrum
2 Disorder who are at least eight years old, have an intellectual disability with an intelligence
3 quotient less than 50 and minimal-to-no language or verbal abilities. Many have epilepsy and are
4 prone to self-injury behaviors and aggression, and therefore require 24-hour supervision and
5 assistance with the activities of daily living in order to be safe; and
6 WHEREAS, The Centers for Disease Control estimates that the percentage of eight-year
7 old children with profound autism among those with autism in the United States, was
8 approximately 26.7 percent, which means that one in four children with autism in America have
9 Profound Autism; and
10 WHEREAS, The Centers for Disease Control also found that the percentage of children
11 with profound autism was higher in girls than in boys, and was also higher in racial and ethnic
12 minorities than in white children, and was more prevalent in low-income families than affluent
13 families. Researchers suggest that the reason for these disparities may be that fewer children in
14 these groups who are mildly affected by autism are given a diagnosis. Tragically, children with
15 Profound Autism are frequently excluded from research and support programs because of their
16 unique needs; and
17 WHEREAS, Profound Autism Day is an event that recognizes people with Profound
18 Autism and advocates for more support for them and their families and advocates for their
19 inclusion in services and research. People with Profound Autism and those who care for them live

1 amongst us and all too often live in isolation. They very much need our inclusion and support,
2 and specific consideration of their unique challenges is vital to their well-being; now, therefore be
3 it
4 RESOLVED, That this Senate of the State of Rhode Island hereby proclaims March 17,
5 2025, to be “Profound Autism Day in Rhode Island”; and be it further
6 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
7 transmit a duly certified copy of this resolution to Ms. Judith Ursitti, Cofounder & President of
8 the Profound Autism Alliance.
