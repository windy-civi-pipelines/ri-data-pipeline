2 INSTRUCTIONS TO THE DEFENDANT
3 Listed below are several possible defenses to the eviction action your landlord has filed
4 against you. If one or more of these defenses apply to your case, check the appropriate box(es). If
5 space is provided, write in facts in support of that defense. Use additional paper if necessary. Some
6 of these defenses are technical, and there may be others not listed here. You may consult a lawyer
7 and seek representation before filling out this Answer.
8 TENANT'S ANSWER
9 The complaint against me is untrue or fails to state the following facts:
10 I offered rent, but my landlord refused it. I am still able and willing to pay the rent.
11 I have a defense for nonpayment because the landlord has failed to maintain the premises
12 in a fit and habitable condition.
13 My rent has not been paid, but I have a legally justifiable defense for not paying:
14 I have a written lease which does not expire until:
15 I have not received the required notice from the landlord before this complaint was served
16 on me.
17 The landlord is trying to evict me because I have exercised my legal rights by calling code
18 enforcement officials, or by taking the following protected action:
19 I have other defenses as follow:
20 WHEREFORE: Because of the defense(s) indicated above, I ask the court to grant a
21 judgment in my favor and not order me to be evicted.
22 COUNTERCLAIM
23 Instructions: If you believe you are entitled to be awarded damages or money for any reason
24 from your landlord, you may fill out the statement below:
