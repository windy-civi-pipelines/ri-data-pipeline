11 § 17-10-1, may cast a vote for president and vice-president on election day at the person’s city or
12 town hall or at an alternate location designated by the board of canvassers, and approved by the
13 board of elections, where such location is deemed necessary to better accommodate such voters.
14 The casting of that vote shall commence the process of voter registration and subject the person
15 voting to the requirements and penalties of this chapter.
16 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, any person who has
17 not yet reached age eighteen (18), but will be age eighteen (18) at the time of a general election,
18 may vote in a primary election, in which candidates are nominated for a general or special election.
