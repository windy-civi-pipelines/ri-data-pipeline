12 bases or outlets of out-of-state manufacturers; and fabricating processes incidental to warehousing
13 or distribution of raw materials, such as alteration of stock for the convenience of a customer; are
14 excluded from this definition;
15 (ii) For the purposes of this section and §§ 44-4-10 and 44-5-38, the term “manufacturer’s
16 inventory,” or any similar term, means and includes the manufacturer’s raw materials, the
17 manufacturer’s work in process, and finished products manufactured by the manufacturer in this
18 state, and not sold, leased, or traded by the manufacturer or its title or right to possession divested;
19 provided, that the term does not include any finished products held by the manufacturer in any retail
20 store or other similar selling place operated by the manufacturer whether or not the retail
21 establishment is located in the same building in which the manufacturer operates the manufacturing
22 plant;
23 (iii) For the purpose of § 44-11-2, a “manufacturer” is a person whose principal business
24 in this state consists of transforming raw materials into a finished product for trade through any or
25 all of the operations described in paragraph (i) of this subdivision. A person will be deemed to be
26 principally engaged if the gross receipts that person derived from the manufacturing operations in

28 fifty percent (50%) of the total gross receipts that person derived from all the business activities in
29 which that person engaged in this state during the taxable year. For the purpose of computing the
30 percentage, gross receipts derived by a manufacturer from the sale, lease, or rental of finished
31 products manufactured by the manufacturer in this state, even though the manufacturer’s store or
32 other selling place may be at a different location from the location of the manufacturer’s
33 manufacturing plant in this state, are deemed to have been derived from manufacturing;

LC001023 - Page 4 of 15
1 “manufacturer” also includes persons who are principally engaged in any of the general activities
2 coded and listed as establishments engaged in manufacturing in the Standard Industrial
3 Classification Manual prepared by the Technical Committee on Industrial Classification, Office of
4 Statistical Standards, Executive Office of the President, United States Bureau of the Budget, as
5 revised from time to time, but eliminating as manufacturers those persons, who, because of their
6 limited type of manufacturing activities, are classified in the manual as falling within the trade
7 rather than an industrial classification of manufacturers. Among those thus eliminated, and
8 accordingly also excluded as manufacturers within the meaning of this paragraph, are persons
9 primarily engaged in selling, to the general public, products produced on the premises from which
10 they are sold, such as neighborhood bakeries, candy stores, ice cream parlors, shade shops, and
11 custom tailors, except, that a person who manufactures bakery products for sale primarily for home

21 reconstructed, erected, installed, or acquired in furtherance of federal or state requirements or
22 standards for the control of water or air pollution or contamination, and certified as approved in an
23 order entered by the director of environmental management. The property is exempt as long as it is
24 operated properly in compliance with the order of approval of the director of environmental
25 management; provided, that any grant of the exemption by the director of environmental
26 management in excess of ten (10) years is approved by the city or town in which the property is

30 placed in operation for the first time after April 13, 1970;

7 equipment is used for the manufacturing processes, research and development, or quality assurance.
8 In the instances where machinery and equipment is used in both manufacturing and/or research and
9 development and/or quality assurance activities and non-manufacturing activities, the assessment
10 on machinery and equipment is prorated by applying the percentage of usage of the equipment for
11 the manufacturing, research and development, and quality-assurance activity to the value of the
12 machinery and equipment for purposes of taxation, and the portion of the value used for
13 manufacturing, research and development, and quality assurance is exempt from taxation. The
14 burden of demonstrating this percentage usage of machinery and equipment for manufacturing and
15 for research and development and/or quality assurance of its manufactured products rests with the
16 manufacturer; and
17 (iii) Machinery and equipment described in §§ 44-18-30(7) and 44-18-30(22) that was
18 purchased after July 1, 1997; provided that the city or town council of the city or town in which the
19 machinery and equipment is located adopts an ordinance exempting the machinery and equipment
20 from taxation. For purposes of this subsection, city councils and town councils of any municipality
21 may, by ordinance, wholly or partially exempt from taxation the machinery and equipment
22 discussed in this subsection for the period of time established in the ordinance and may, by
23 ordinance, establish the procedures for taxpayers to avail themselves of the benefit of any
24 exemption permitted under this section; provided, that the ordinance does not apply to any
25 machinery or equipment of a business, subsidiary, or any affiliated business that locates or relocates
26 from a city or town in this state to another city or town in the state;
27 (23) Precious metal bullion, meaning any elementary metal that has been put through a
28 process of melting or refining, and that is in a state or condition that its value depends upon its
29 content and not its form. The term does not include fabricated precious metal that has been
30 processed or manufactured for some one or more specific and customary industrial, professional,
31 or artistic uses;
32 (24) Hydroelectric power-generation equipment, which includes, but is not limited to,

3 equipment to generate hydroelectric power;

14 are generated primarily by the same taxpayer and where the personal property is located at, in, or
15 adjacent to a generating facility of the taxpayer. The taxpayer may, but need not, procure an order
16 from the director of the department of environmental management certifying that the tangible
17 personal property has this function, which order effects a conclusive presumption that the tangible
18 personal property qualifies for the exemption under this subdivision. If any information relating to
19 secret processes or methods of manufacture, production, or treatment is disclosed to the department
20 of environmental management only to procure an order, and is a “trade secret” as defined in § 28-
21 21-10(b), it shall not be open to public inspection or publicly disclosed unless disclosure is

7 place in it primarily for the purpose of transforming raw materials into a finished product for trade
8 through any or all of the following operations: adapting, altering, finishing, making, and
9 ornamenting; provided, that public utilities; non-regulated power producers commencing
10 commercial operation by selling electricity at retail or taking title to generating facilities on or after
11 July 1, 1997; building and construction contractors; warehousing operations, including distribution
12 bases or outlets of out-of-state manufacturers; and fabricating processes incidental to warehousing
13 or distribution of raw materials, such as alteration of stock for the convenience of a customer; are
14 excluded from this definition;
15 (ii) For the purposes of this section and §§ 44-4-10 and 44-5-38, the term “manufacturer’s
16 inventory,” or any similar term, means and includes the manufacturer’s raw materials, the
17 manufacturer’s work in process, and finished products manufactured by the manufacturer in this
18 state, and not sold, leased, or traded by the manufacturer or its title or right to possession divested;
19 provided, that the term does not include any finished products held by the manufacturer in any retail
20 store or other similar selling place operated by the manufacturer whether or not the retail
21 establishment is located in the same building in which the manufacturer operates the manufacturing
22 plant;
23 (iii) For the purpose of § 44-11-2, a “manufacturer” is a person whose principal business
24 in this state consists of transforming raw materials into a finished product for trade through any or
25 all of the operations described in paragraph (i) of this subdivision. A person will be deemed to be
26 principally engaged if the gross receipts that person derived from the manufacturing operations in
27 this state during the calendar year or fiscal year mentioned in § 44-11-1 amounted to more than
28 fifty percent (50%) of the total gross receipts that person derived from all the business activities in
29 which that person engaged in this state during the taxable year. For the purpose of computing the
30 percentage, gross receipts derived by a manufacturer from the sale, lease, or rental of finished
31 products manufactured by the manufacturer in this state, even though the manufacturer’s store or
32 other selling place may be at a different location from the location of the manufacturer’s
33 manufacturing plant in this state, are deemed to have been derived from manufacturing;
34 (iv) Within the meaning of the preceding paragraphs of this subdivision, the term
LC001023 - Page 4 of 15

1 “manufacturer” also includes persons who are principally engaged in any of the general activities
2 coded and listed as establishments engaged in manufacturing in the Standard Industrial
3 Classification Manual prepared by the Technical Committee on Industrial Classification, Office of
4 Statistical Standards, Executive Office of the President, United States Bureau of the Budget, as
5 revised from time to time, but eliminating as manufacturers those persons, who, because of their
6 limited type of manufacturing activities, are classified in the manual as falling within the trade
7 rather than an industrial classification of manufacturers. Among those thus eliminated, and
8 accordingly also excluded as manufacturers within the meaning of this paragraph, are persons
9 primarily engaged in selling, to the general public, products produced on the premises from which
10 they are sold, such as neighborhood bakeries, candy stores, ice cream parlors, shade shops, and
11 custom tailors, except, that a person who manufactures bakery products for sale primarily for home
12 delivery, or through one or more non-baking retail outlets, and whether or not retail outlets are
13 operated by the person, is a manufacturer within the meaning of this paragraph;
14 (v) The term “Person” means and includes, as appropriate, a person, partnership, or
15 corporation; and
16 (vi) The department of revenue shall provide to the local assessors any assistance that is
17 necessary in determining the proper application of the definitions in this subdivision;
18 (21) Real and tangible personal property acquired to provide a treatment facility used
19 primarily to control the pollution or contamination of the waters or the air of the state, as defined
20 in chapter 12 of title 46 and chapter 25 of title 23, respectively, the facility having been constructed,
21 reconstructed, erected, installed, or acquired in furtherance of federal or state requirements or
22 standards for the control of water or air pollution or contamination, and certified as approved in an
23 order entered by the director of environmental management. The property is exempt as long as it is
24 operated properly in compliance with the order of approval of the director of environmental
25 management; provided, that any grant of the exemption by the director of environmental
26 management in excess of ten (10) years is approved by the city or town in which the property is
27 situated. This provision applies only to water and air pollution control properties and facilities
28 installed for the treatment of waste waters and air contaminants resulting from industrial
29 processing; furthermore, it applies only to water or air pollution control properties and facilities
30 placed in operation for the first time after April 13, 1970;
31 (22) Manufacturing machinery and equipment acquired or used by a manufacturer after
32 December 31, 1974. Manufacturing machinery and equipment is defined as:
33 (i) Machinery and equipment used exclusively in the actual manufacture or conversion of
34 raw materials or goods in the process of manufacture by a manufacturer, as defined in subdivision
LC001023 - Page 5 of 15

1 (20), and machinery, fixtures, and equipment used exclusively by a manufacturer for research and
2 development or for quality assurance of its manufactured products;
3 (ii) Machinery and equipment that is partially used in the actual manufacture or conversion
4 of raw materials or goods in process of manufacture by a manufacturer, as defined in subdivision
5 (20), and machinery, fixtures, and equipment used by a manufacturer for research and development
6 or for quality assurance of its manufactured products, to the extent to which the machinery and
7 equipment is used for the manufacturing processes, research and development, or quality assurance.
8 In the instances where machinery and equipment is used in both manufacturing and/or research and
9 development and/or quality assurance activities and non-manufacturing activities, the assessment
10 on machinery and equipment is prorated by applying the percentage of usage of the equipment for
11 the manufacturing, research and development, and quality-assurance activity to the value of the
12 machinery and equipment for purposes of taxation, and the portion of the value used for
13 manufacturing, research and development, and quality assurance is exempt from taxation. The
14 burden of demonstrating this percentage usage of machinery and equipment for manufacturing and
15 for research and development and/or quality assurance of its manufactured products rests with the
16 manufacturer; and
17 (iii) Machinery and equipment described in §§ 44-18-30(7) and 44-18-30(22) that was
18 purchased after July 1, 1997; provided that the city or town council of the city or town in which the
19 machinery and equipment is located adopts an ordinance exempting the machinery and equipment
20 from taxation. For purposes of this subsection, city councils and town councils of any municipality
21 may, by ordinance, wholly or partially exempt from taxation the machinery and equipment
22 discussed in this subsection for the period of time established in the ordinance and may, by
23 ordinance, establish the procedures for taxpayers to avail themselves of the benefit of any
24 exemption permitted under this section; provided, that the ordinance does not apply to any
25 machinery or equipment of a business, subsidiary, or any affiliated business that locates or relocates
26 from a city or town in this state to another city or town in the state;
27 (23) Precious metal bullion, meaning any elementary metal that has been put through a
28 process of melting or refining, and that is in a state or condition that its value depends upon its
29 content and not its form. The term does not include fabricated precious metal that has been
30 processed or manufactured for some one or more specific and customary industrial, professional,
31 or artistic uses;
32 (24) Hydroelectric power-generation equipment, which includes, but is not limited to,
33 turbines, generators, switchgear, controls, monitoring equipment, circuit breakers, transformers,
34 protective relaying, bus bars, cables, connections, trash racks, headgates, and conduits. The
LC001023 - Page 6 of 15

1 hydroelectric power-generation equipment must have been purchased after July 1, 1979, and
2 acquired or used by a person or corporation who or that owns or leases a dam and utilizes the
3 equipment to generate hydroelectric power;
4 (25) Subject to authorization by formal action of the council of any city or town, any real
5 or personal property owned by, held in trust for, or leased to an organization incorporated under
6 chapter 6 of title 7, as amended, or an organization meeting the definition of “charitable trust” set
7 out in § 18-9-4, as amended, or an organization incorporated under the not-for-profits statutes of
8 another state or the District of Columbia, the purpose of which is the conserving of open space, as
9 that term is defined in chapter 36 of title 45, as amended, provided the property is used exclusively
10 for the purposes of the organization;
11 (26) Tangible personal property, the primary function of which is the recycling, reuse, or
12 recovery of materials (other than precious metals, as defined in § 44-18-30(24)(ii) and (iii)), from,
13 or the treatment of “hazardous wastes,” as defined in § 23-19.1-4, where the “hazardous wastes”
14 are generated primarily by the same taxpayer and where the personal property is located at, in, or
15 adjacent to a generating facility of the taxpayer. The taxpayer may, but need not, procure an order
16 from the director of the department of environmental management certifying that the tangible
17 personal property has this function, which order effects a conclusive presumption that the tangible
18 personal property qualifies for the exemption under this subdivision. If any information relating to
19 secret processes or methods of manufacture, production, or treatment is disclosed to the department
20 of environmental management only to procure an order, and is a “trade secret” as defined in § 28-
