30 of the application. The running of the time period set forth herein will be deemed stopped upon the
31 issuance of a written certificate of incompleteness of the application by the administrative officer
32 and will recommence upon the resubmission of a corrected application by the applicant. However,
33 in no event will the administrative officer be required to certify a corrected submission as complete

13 submission of a written consent.
14 (D) Failure to act. Failure of the local review board to act within the prescribed period
15 constitutes approval of the preliminary plan, and a certificate of the administrative officer as to the
16 failure of the local review board to act within the required time and the resulting approval shall be
17 issued on request of the applicant. Further, if the public hearing is not convened or a decision is not

25 (I) The proposed development is consistent with local needs as identified in the local
26 comprehensive community plan with particular emphasis on the community’s affordable housing
27 plan and/or has satisfactorily addressed the issues where there may be inconsistencies.
28 (II) The proposed development is in compliance with the standards and provisions of the
29 municipality’s zoning ordinance and subdivision regulations, and/or where adjustments are
30 requested by the applicant, that local concerns that have been affected by the relief granted do not
31 outweigh the state and local need for low- and moderate-income housing.
32 (III) All low- and moderate-income housing units proposed are integrated throughout the
33 development; are compatible in scale and architectural style to the market rate units within the
34 project; and will be built and occupied prior to, or simultaneous with the construction and
LC001042 - Page 10 of 31

1 occupancy of any market rate units.
2 (IV) There will be no significant negative impacts on the health and safety of current or
3 future residents of the community, in areas including, but not limited to, safe circulation of

5 of potable water, adequate surface water run-off, and the preservation of natural, historical, or
6 cultural features that contribute to the attractiveness of the community.
7 (V) All proposed land developments and all subdivisions lots will have adequate and
8 permanent physical access to a public street in accordance with the requirements of § 45-23-
9 60(a)(5).
10 (VI) The proposed development will not result in the creation of individual lots with any
11 physical constraints to development that building on those lots according to pertinent regulations
12 and building standards would be impracticable, unless created only as permanent open space or
13 permanently reserved for a public purpose on the approved, recorded plans.
14 (F) Required findings for denial. In reviewing the comprehensive permit request, the
15 local review board may deny the request for any of the following reasons: (I) If the city or town
16 has an approved affordable housing plan and is meeting housing needs, and the proposal is
17 inconsistent with the affordable housing plan; provided that, the local review board also finds that
18 the municipality has made significant progress in implementing that housing plan; (II) The proposal
19 is not consistent with local needs, including, but not limited to, the needs identified in an approved
20 comprehensive plan, and/or local zoning ordinances and procedures promulgated in conformance
21 with the comprehensive plan; (III) The proposal is not in conformance with the comprehensive
22 plan; (IV) The community has met or has plans to meet the goal of ten percent (10%) of the year-
23 round units or, in the case of an urban town or city, fifteen percent (15%) of the occupied rental
24 housing units as defined in § 45-53-3(5)(i) being low- and moderate-income housing; provided
25 that, the local review board also finds that the community has achieved or has made significant
26 progress towards meeting the goals required by this section; or (V) Concerns for the environment
27 and the health and safety of current residents have not been adequately addressed.
28 (iv) Vesting. The approved preliminary plan is vested for a period of two (2) years with
29 the right to extend for two (2), one-year extensions upon written request by the applicant, who must
30 appear before the planning board for each annual review and provide proof of valid state or federal
31 permits as applicable. Thereafter, vesting may be extended for a longer period, for good cause
32 shown, if requested, in writing by the applicant, and approved by the local review board. The
33 vesting for the preliminary plan approval includes all ordinance provisions and regulations at the
34 time of the approval, general and specific conditions shown on the approved preliminary plan

2 (3) Final plan review. The second and final stage of review for the comprehensive permit
3 project shall be done administratively, unless an applicant has requested and been granted any
4 waivers from the submission of checklist items for preliminary plan review, and then, at the local
5 review board’s discretion, it may vote to require the applicant to return for final plan review and
6 approval.

8 include:
9 (A) All required state and federal permits must be obtained prior to the final plan approval
10 or the issuance of a building permit; and
11 (B) A draft monitoring agreement which identifies an approved entity that will monitor the
12 long-term affordability of the low- and moderate-income units pursuant to § 45-53-3.2; and
13 (C) A sample land lease or deed restriction with affordability liens that will restrict use as
14 low- and moderate-income housing in conformance with the guidelines of the agency providing
15 the subsidy for the low- and moderate-income housing, but for a period of not less than thirty (30)
16 years; and
17 (D) Those items required by local regulations promulgated pursuant to applicable state law
18 included in the checklist for final plan review in the local regulations promulgated pursuant to

21 construction schedule and/or financial guarantees; and
22 (II) Certification by the tax collector that all property taxes are current; and
23 (III) For phased projects, the final plan for phases following the first phase, shall be
24 accompanied by copies of as-built drawings not previously submitted of all existing public
25 improvements for prior phases.
26 (ii) Certification of completeness. The final plan application must be certified complete
27 or incomplete by the administrative officer according to the provisions of § 45-23-36; provided
28 however, that the certificate shall be granted within twenty-five (25) days of submission of the
29 application. The running of the time period set forth herein will be deemed stopped upon the
30 issuance of a written certificate of incompleteness of the application by the administrative officer
31 and will recommence upon the resubmission of a corrected application by the applicant. However,
32 in no event will the administrative officer be required to certify a corrected submission as complete
33 or incomplete less than ten (10) days after its resubmission. If the administrative officer certifies
34 the application as incomplete, the officer shall set forth in writing with specificity the missing or
LC001042 - Page 12 of 31

1 incomplete items.
2 (iii) Review of applications.
3 (A) Timeframe for review. The reviewing authority shall render a decision on the final
4 plan application within forty-five (45) days of the date the application is certified complete.
5 (B) Modifications and changes to plans:
6 (I) Minor changes, as defined in the local regulations, to the plans approved at preliminary
7 plan may be approved administratively, by the administrative officer, whereupon final plan
8 approval may be issued. The changes may be authorized without additional public hearings, at the
9 discretion of the administrative officer. All changes shall be made part of the permanent record of
10 the project application. This provision does not prohibit the administrative officer from requesting
11 a recommendation from either the technical review committee or the local review board. Denial of
12 the proposed change(s) shall be referred to the local review board for review as a major change.
13 (II) Major changes, as defined in the local regulations, to the plans approved at preliminary
14 plan may be approved only by the local review board and must follow the same review and public
15 hearing process required for approval of preliminary plans as described in subsection (d)(2)(iii) of
16 this section.
17 (III) The administrative officer shall notify the applicant in writing within fourteen (14)
18 days of submission of the final plan application if the administrative officer is referring the
19 application to the local review board under this subsection.
20 (C) Decision on final plan. An application filed in accordance with this chapter shall be
21 approved by the administrative officer unless such application does not satisfy conditions set forth
22 in the preliminary plan approval decision or such application does not have the requisite state and/or
23 federal approvals or other required submissions, does not post the required improvement bonds, or
24 such application is a major modification of the plans approved at preliminary plan.
25 (D) Failure to act. Failure of the reviewing authority to act within the prescribed period
26 constitutes approval of the final plan, and a certificate of the administrative officer as to the failure
27 to act within the required time and the resulting approval shall be issued on request of the applicant.
28 (iv) Vesting. The approved final plan is vested for a period of two (2) years with the right
29 to extend for one one-year extension upon written request by the applicant, who must appear before
30 the planning board for the extension request. Thereafter, vesting may be extended for a longer
31 period, for good cause shown, if requested, in writing by the applicant, and approved by the local
32 review board.
33 (4) Infeasibility of conditions of approval. The burden is on the applicant to show, by
34 competent evidence before the local review board, that proposed conditions of approval are
LC001042 - Page 13 of 31

1 infeasible, as defined in § 45-53-3. Upon request, the applicant shall be provided a reasonable
2 opportunity to respond to such proposed conditions prior to a final vote on the application.
3 (5) Fees. Municipalities may impose fees on comprehensive permit applications that are
4 consistent with but do not exceed fees that would otherwise be assessed for a project of the same
5 scope and type, but not proceeding under this chapter; provided, however, the imposition of such
6 fees shall not preclude a showing by an applicant that the fees make the project financially
7 infeasible.
8 (6) Recording of written decisions. All written decisions on applications under this
9 chapter shall be recorded in the land evidence records within twenty (20) days after the local review
10 board’s vote or the administrative officer’s decision, as applicable. A copy of the recorded decision
11 shall be mailed within one business day of recording, by any method that provides confirmation of
12 receipt, to the applicant and to any objector who has filed a written request for notice with the
13 administrative officer.
14 (7) Local review board powers. The local review board has the same power to issue
15 permits or approvals that any local board or official who would otherwise act with respect to the
16 application, including, but not limited to, the power to attach to the permit or approval, conditions,
17 and requirements with respect to height, site plan, size or shape, or building materials, as are
18 consistent with the terms of this section.
19 (8) Majority vote required. All local review board decisions on comprehensive permits
20 shall be by majority vote of the members present at the proceeding.
21 (9) Construction timetable. A comprehensive permit shall expire unless construction is
22 started within twelve (12) months and completed within sixty (60) months of the recording of the
23 final plan unless a longer and/or phased period for development is agreed to by the local review
24 board and the applicant. Low- and moderate-income housing units shall be built and occupied prior
25 to, or simultaneous with the construction and occupancy of market rate units.
26 (10) For-profit developers — Limits. A town with an approved affordable housing plan
27 and that is meeting local housing needs, as defined in this chapter, may by council action limit the
28 annual total number of dwelling units in comprehensive permit applications from for-profit
29 developers to an aggregate of one percent (1%) of the total number of year-round housing units in
30 the town, as recognized in the affordable housing plan and notwithstanding the timetables set forth
31 elsewhere in this section, the local review board shall have the authority to consider comprehensive
32 permit applications from for-profit developers, which are made pursuant to this paragraph,
33 sequentially in the order in which they are submitted.
34 (11) Report. The local review board of a town with an approved affordable housing plan
LC001042 - Page 14 of 31

1 shall report the status of implementation to the housing resources commission, including the
2 disposition of any applications made under the plan, as of June 30, 2006, by September 1, 2006,
3 and for each June 30 thereafter by September 1 through 2010. The housing resources commission
4 shall prepare by October 15 and adopt by December 31, a report on the status of implementation,
5 which shall be submitted to the governor, the speaker and the president of the senate, and shall find
6 which towns are not in compliance with implementation requirements.
7 (12) Remanded applications. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 45-53-4 in effect on
8 February 13, 2004, a local review board shall commence hearings within thirty (30) days of
9 receiving an application remanded pursuant to § 45-53-5 or, effective January 1, 2024, § 45-53-
10 5.1. In any town with more than one remanded application, applications may be scheduled for
11 hearing in the order in which they were received, and may be taken up sequentially, with the thirty-
12 day (30) requirement for the initiation of hearings, commencing upon the decision of the earlier
13 filed application.
14 (e)(1) The general assembly finds and declares that in January 2004 towns throughout
15 Rhode Island have been confronted by an unprecedented volume and complexity of development
16 applications as a result of private for-profit developers using the provisions of this chapter and that
17 in order to protect the public health and welfare in communities and to provide sufficient time to
18 establish a reasonable and orderly process for the consideration of applications made under the
19 provisions of this chapter, and to have communities prepare plans to meet low- and moderate-
20 income housing goals, that it is necessary to impose a moratorium on the use of comprehensive
21 permit applications as herein provided by private for-profit developers; a moratorium is hereby
22 imposed on the use of the provisions of this chapter by private for-profit developers, which
23 moratorium shall be effective on passage and shall expire on January 31, 2005, and may be revisited
24 prior to expiration and extended to such other date as may be established by law. Notwithstanding
25 the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, private for-profit developers may not utilize the
26 procedure of this chapter until the expiration of the moratorium.
27 (2) No for-profit developer shall submit a new application for comprehensive permits until
28 July 1, 2005, except by mutual agreement with the local review board.
29 (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (e)(2) of this section, a local review board
30 in a town which has submitted a plan in accordance with subsection (f) of this section, shall not be
31 required to accept an application for a new comprehensive permit from a for-profit developer until
32 October 1, 2005.
33 (f) Towns and cities that are not in conformity with the provisions of § 45-53-3(5)(i) shall
34 prepare by December 31, 2004, a comprehensive plan housing element for low- and moderate-
LC001042 - Page 15 of 31

1 income housing as specified by § 45-53-3(5)(ii), consistent with applicable law and regulation.
2 That the secretary of the planning board or commission of each city or town subject to the
3 requirements of this paragraph shall report in writing the status of the preparation of the housing
4 element for low- and moderate-income housing on or before June 30, 2004, and on or before
5 December 31, 2004, to the secretary of the state planning council, to the chair of the house
6 committee on corporations and to the chair of the senate committee on commerce, housing and
7 municipal government.
8 (g) If any provision of this section or the application thereof shall for any reason be judged
9 invalid, the judgment shall not affect, impair, or invalidate the remainder of this section or of any
10 other provision of this chapter, but shall be confined in its effect to the provision or application
11 directly involved in the controversy giving rise to the judgment, and a moratorium on the
12 applications of for-profit developers pursuant to this chapter shall remain and continue to be in
13 effect for the period commencing on the day this section becomes law [February 13, 2004] and
14 continue until it shall expire on January 31, 2005, or until amended further.
15 (h) In planning for, awarding, and otherwise administering programs and funds for housing
16 and for community development, state departments, agencies, boards and commissions, and public
17 corporations, as defined in chapter 18 of title 35, shall among the towns subject to the provision of
18 § 45-53-3(5)(ii), give priority to the maximum extent allowable by law to towns with an approved
19 affordable housing plan. The director of administration shall adopt not later than January 31, 2005,
20 regulations to implement the provisions of this section.
21 (i) Multi-family rental units built under a comprehensive permit may be calculated towards
22 meeting the requirements of a municipality’s low- or moderate-income housing inventory, as long
23 as the units meet and are in compliance with the provisions of § 45-53-3.1.
24 45-53-5.1. Appeals — Judicial review.
25 (a) Effective January 1, 2024, as a replacement to § 45-53-5. A decision of a local review
26 board may be appealed by the applicant or an aggrieved party, as defined by § 45-24-31, to the
27 superior court for the county in which the property is situated. The appeal shall be taken within
28 twenty (20) days after the date of the recording and posting of the decision by the local review
29 board, by filing with the superior court a complaint that contains a statement of the prior
30 proceedings and the reasons upon which the appeal is based. The complaint shall name the local
31 review board as the appellee and serve the local review board with the appeal within twenty (20)
32 days of filing of the appeal. If an aggrieved party who or that is not the applicant files an appeal,
33 the original applicant shall be named as a party and served in the same manner as the local review
34 board.
LC001042 - Page 16 of 31

1 (b) The local review board shall not be required to answer the complaint, but it shall submit
2 the complete local review board record to superior court within thirty (30) days of receiving service
3 of the complaint. Should the local review board fail to file the record within thirty (30) days, the
4 applicant may move for default.
5 (c) The appeal shall be expedited and given priority on the court calendar as soon as proof
6 of service of the complaint on the local review board is filed. The appeal shall be decided as soon
7 as possible by the superior court, without delay.
8 (d) The review shall be conducted by the superior court without a jury. The court shall
9 consider the record of the hearing before the local review board and, if it appears to the court that
10 additional evidence is necessary for the proper disposition of the matter, it may allow any party to
11 the appeal to present that evidence in open court, which evidence, along with the record, constitutes
12 the record upon which the determination of the court is made.
13 (e) The superior court shall review the appeal under the following standards:
14 (1) Whether the decision was arbitrary and capricious or clearly erroneous in light of
15 considerations regarding:
16 (i) The consistency of the decision to deny or condition the permit with the approved
17 affordable housing plan;
18 (ii) The extent to which the community meets or plans to meet housing needs, as defined
19 in an affordable housing plan, including, but not limited to, the ten percent (10%) goal for existing
20 low- and moderate-income housing units as a proportion of year-round housing;
21 (iii) The consideration of environmental protection;
22 (iv) The state’s need for low- and moderate-income housing;
23 (v) The need to protect the health and safety of the occupants of the proposed housing or
24 the residents of the city or town;
25 (vi) The need to promote better site and building design in relation to the surroundings or
26 to preserve open space; and
27 (vii) Whether the reasons for denial, local zoning or land use ordinances, requirements and
28 regulations are applied as equally as possible to both subsidized and unsubsidized housing.
29 (f) If the appeal is by an applicant for a decision approving an application with conditions,
30 the superior court shall, in addition to reviewing the standards and considerations set forth in
31 subsection (e) of this section, determine whether such conditions and requirements imposed make
32 the construction or operation of the housing infeasible.
33 (g) The court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the local review board as to the
34 weight of the evidence on questions of fact. The court may affirm the decision of the local review
LC001042 - Page 17 of 31

1 board or remand the case for further proceedings, or may reverse or modify the decision if
2 substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because of findings, inferences,
3 conclusions, or decisions that were arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable.
4 (h) An aggrieved party may, within twenty (20) days from the date of entry of the judgment
5 of superior court, petition the supreme court of the state of Rhode Island for a writ of certiorari to
6 review any questions of law involved. The petition for a writ of certiorari shall set forth the errors
7 claimed. Upon the filing of such a petition with the clerk of the supreme court, the supreme court
8 may, if it sees fit, issue its writ of certiorari to the superior court to certify to the supreme court the
9 record of the record under review, or so much thereof as was submitted to the superior court by the
10 parties, together with any additional record of the proceedings in the superior court.
11 (i) Effective January 1, 2024, all matters pending before the state housing appeals board
12 shall be transferred to superior court for the county in which the property is situated by the applicant
13 filing a complaint in superior court and providing a copy of the complaint to the attorney
14 representing the local review board within ten (10) days of filing. An applicant with an appeal
15 pending before the state housing appeals board shall have until March 1, 2024, to file the complaint
16 transferring the matter to superior court for the county in which the property is situated. The parties
17 shall be required to file the entire record before the state housing appeals board with superior court
18 within forty-five (45) days of the filing of the complaint.
19 (j) Effective January 1, 2024, this section shall replace the provisions of § 45-53-5 and any
20 reference in the general laws to § 45-53-5 shall mean § 45-53-5.1.
21 45-53-6. Powers of state housing appeals board. [Expires January 1, 2024.]
22 (a) Effective until January 1, 2024, the state housing appeals board shall have the powers
23 to: (i) Adopt, amend, and repeal rules and regulations that are consistent with this chapter and are
24 necessary to implement the requirements of §§ 45-53-5, 45-53-6, and 45-53-7; (ii) Receive and
25 expend state appropriations; and (iii) Establish a reasonable fee schedule, which may be waived, to
26 carry out its duties.
27 (b) In hearing the appeal, the state housing appeals board shall determine whether: (i) In
28 the case of the denial of an application, the decision of the local review board was consistent with
29 an approved affordable housing plan, or if the town does not have an approved affordable housing
30 plan, was reasonable and consistent with local needs; and (ii) In the case of an approval of an
31 application with conditions and requirements imposed, whether those conditions and requirements
32 make the construction or operation of the housing infeasible and whether those conditions and
33 requirements are consistent with an approved affordable housing plan, or if the town does not have
34 an approved affordable housing plan, are consistent with local needs.
LC001042 - Page 18 of 31

1 (c) In making a determination, the standards for reviewing the appeal include, but are not
2 limited to:
3 (1) The consistency of the decision to deny or condition the permit with the approved
4 affordable housing plan and/or approved comprehensive plan;
5 (2) The extent to which the community meets or plans to meet housing needs, as defined
6 in an affordable housing plan, including, but not limited to, the ten percent (10%) goal for existing
7 low- and moderate-income housing units as a proportion of year-round housing;
8 (3) The consideration of the health and safety of existing residents;
9 (4) The consideration of environmental protection; and
10 (5) The extent to which the community applies local zoning ordinances and review
11 procedures evenly on subsidized and unsubsidized housing applications alike.
12 (d) If the appeals board finds, in the case of a denial, that the decision of the local review
13 board was not consistent with an approved affordable housing plan, or if the town does not have an
14 approved affordable housing plan, was not reasonable and consistent with local needs, it shall
15 vacate the decision and issue a decision and order approving the application, denying the
16 application, or approving with various conditions consistent with local needs. If the appeals board
17 finds, in the case of an approval with conditions and requirements imposed, that the decision of the
18 local review board makes the building or operation of the housing infeasible, and/or the conditions
19 and requirements are not consistent with an approved affordable housing plan, or if the town does
20 not have an approved affordable housing plan, are not consistent with local needs, it shall issue a
21 decision and order, modifying or removing any condition or requirement so as to make the proposal
22 no longer infeasible and/or consistent, and approving the application; provided, that the appeals
23 board shall not issue any decision and order that would permit the building or operation of the
24 housing in accordance with standards less safe than the applicable building and site plan
25 requirements of the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development or the Rhode Island
26 housing and mortgage finance corporation, whichever agency is financially assisting the housing.
27 Decisions or conditions and requirements imposed by a local review board that are consistent with
28 approved affordable housing plans and/or with local needs shall not be vacated, modified, or
29 removed by the appeals board notwithstanding that the decision or conditions and requirements
30 have the effect of denying or making the applicant’s proposal infeasible.
31 (e) The appeals board or the applicant has the power to enforce the orders of the appeals
32 board by an action brought in the superior court. The local review board shall carry out the decision
33 and order of the appeals board within thirty (30) days of its entry and, upon failure to do so, the
34 decision and order of the appeals board is, for all purposes, deemed to be the action of the local
LC001042 - Page 19 of 31

1 review board, unless the applicant consents to a different decision or order by the local review
2 board. The decision and order of the appeals board is binding on the city or town, which shall
3 immediately issue any and all necessary permits and approvals to allow the construction and
4 operation of the housing as approved by the appeals board.
5 (f) The state housing appeals board shall:
6 (1) Upon an appeal of the applicant prior to August 1, 2004, rule on December 1, 2004, on
7 the substantial completeness of applications as of February 13, 2004, that were affected by the
8 moratorium established by § 45-53-4(b).

3 of review determined the application to be substantially complete and/or acted in a manner
4 demonstrating that it considered the application substantially complete for the purposes of
5 reviewing the application, the state housing appeals board shall consider the application
6 substantially complete.
7 (2) Remand for hearing in accordance with the provisions of § 45-53-4 applications that
8 are determined to be substantially complete, which hearings may be conducted (or resume) under
9 the provisions in effect on February 13, 2004, unless the applicant and the board shall mutually
10 agree that the hearing shall proceed under the provisions in effect on December 1, 2004, which
11 hearings may commence on or after January 1, 2005, but shall commence not later than January

13 commencement date is mutually agreed to by the applicant and the local board hearing the
14 applications; the local review board shall not be obligated to hear, and may deny, any application
15 affected by the moratorium unless it was determined to be substantially complete in accordance
16 with the provisions of subsection (f)(1) of this section, and the local review board may require such
17 additional submissions as may be specified by the town or necessary for the review of the
