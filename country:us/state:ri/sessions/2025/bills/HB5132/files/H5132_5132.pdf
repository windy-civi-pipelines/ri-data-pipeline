7 training, the statute of limitations for filing a private cause of action is tolled.
8 28-61-15. Severability clause.
9 If any clause, paragraph, subparagraph, article, provision, section, or part of this chapter
10 are held to be unconstitutional or void, the holding to such effect shall not affect, impair, or
11 invalidate the remainder of this chapter. The effect of said holding shall be limited solely to the
12 clause, paragraph, subparagraph, article, provision, section, or part thereof thus held to be
13 unconstitutional or void.
14 28-61-16. Conflict with laws.
15 (a) Nothing in this chapter should limit employee rights under any other law including
16 OSHA, laws under state-level OSHA agencies or their equivalent, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act,
17 the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, state EEO laws,
