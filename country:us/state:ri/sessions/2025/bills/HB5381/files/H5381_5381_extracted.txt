27 in this section shall be construed to prevent the secretary of state or the local board, as the case may

2 require the production of books, papers, and documents. The witnesses shall be summoned in the
3 same manner, be paid the same fees, and be subject to the same penalties for default as witnesses
4 before the superior court. A summons may be sworn to and an oath may be administered by the
5 board. When an objection has been filed, notice of the objection shall be immediately given by
6 registered or certified mail or by personal service by the state board to the candidates, addressed to
7 the residence of the candidate as given in the nomination papers, and to any party committee
8 interested in the nomination to which objection is made. The state board shall promulgate rules and
9 regulations on challenges to nomination papers filed by any candidate, an individual presenting
10 written authorization from the candidate, or the chairperson of any party committee that questions
11 the validity or authenticity of any signature on the nomination paper of a candidate.
12 (b) Additional notice may also be given by the state board if it sees fit to do so. The decision
13 of the board shall be rendered within two (2) days for nomination papers for candidates

17 (c) All objections to nomination papers other than state and federal candidates shall be

20 by the state board.
