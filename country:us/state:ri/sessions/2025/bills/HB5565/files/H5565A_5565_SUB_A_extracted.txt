2 documentary evidence would tend to incriminate the witness, but the testimony or the evidence of
3 the books or papers so produced shall not be used in any criminal proceedings against the witness.
4 (b) If any person disobeys this process or, having appeared in obedience to it, refuses to
5 answer any pertinent question put to the person by the tax administrator or his or her authorized
6 agent or to produce any books and papers pursuant to the process, the tax administrator or the agent
7 may apply to the sixth division of the district court, stating the disobedience to process or refusal
8 to answer, and the court shall cite the person to appear before the court to answer that question or
9 to produce those books and papers, and, upon his or her refusal so to do, shall commit the person
10 to the adult correctional institutions, for a period not to exceed sixty (60) days. Notwithstanding
11 the serving of the term of this commitment by any person, the tax administrator may proceed in all
12 respects with this inquiry and examination as if the witness had not previously been called upon to
13 testify.
14 (c) Officers who serve subpoenas issued by the tax administrator or under the tax
15 administrator's authority and witnesses subpoenaed by the tax administrator under this section shall

25 why the hearing should be granted and the manner of relief sought. The tax administrator shall
26 notify the applicant of the time and place fixed for the hearing. After the hearing, the tax
27 administrator may make the order in the premises as may appear to the tax administrator just and
28 lawful and shall furnish a copy of the order to the applicant. The tax administrator may, by notice
29 in writing, at any time, order a hearing on the tax administrator’s own initiative and require the
30 taxpayer or any other individual whom the tax administrator believes to be in possession of
31 information concerning any manufacture, importation, or sale of kratom or kratom products to
32 appear before the tax administrator or the tax administrator’s authorized agent with any specific

LC001746/SUB A - Page 22 of 25
1 Any person aggrieved by any decision of the tax administrator under the provisions of this

3 court. The appellant shall at the time of taking an appeal file with the court a bond of recognizance
4 to the state, with surety to prosecute the appeal to effect and to comply with the orders and decrees
5 of the court in the premises. These appeals are preferred cases, to be heard, unless cause appears to
6 the contrary, in priority to other cases. The court may grant relief as may be equitable. If the court
7 determines that the appeal was taken without probable cause, the court may tax double or triple
8 costs, as the case demands; and, upon all those appeals, which may be denied, costs may be taxed
9 against the appellant at the discretion of the court. In no case shall costs be taxed against the state,
10 its officers, or agents. A party aggrieved by a final order of the court may seek review of the order
11 in the supreme court by writ of certiorari in accordance with the procedures contained in § 42-35-
12 16.
13 44-20.3-13. Claim for refund.
14 Whenever the tax administrator determines that any person is entitled to a refund of any
15 monies paid by a person under the provisions of this chapter, or whenever a court of competent
16 jurisdiction orders a refund of any monies paid, the general treasurer shall, upon certification by
17 the tax administrator and with the approval of the director of revenue, pay the refund from any
18 monies in the treasury not appropriated without any further act or resolution making appropriation
19 for the refund. No refund is allowed unless a claim is filed with the tax administrator within three
20 (3) years from the fifteenth day after the close of the month for which the overpayment was made.
21 44-20.3-14. Administration — Forms — Rules and regulations.
22 The tax administrator is authorized to promulgate rules and regulations to carry out the
23 provisions, policies, and purposes of this chapter. The provisions of this chapter shall be liberally
24 construed to foster the enforcement of and compliance with all provisions herein related to taxation.

26 authorized agent of the department of health and the attorney general any information that the
27 administrator may consider proper contained in tax reports or returns or any audit or the report of
28 any investigation made with respect to them, filed pursuant to the tax laws of this state, to whom
29 disclosure is necessary for the purpose of ensuring compliance with state law and regulations.
30 44-20.3-15. Severability.
31 The provisions of this chapter are declared to be severable; and in case any part, section,
32 or provision of this chapter is held void by any court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining parts,
33 sections, and provisions of the chapter are not impaired or affected.

3 court. The appellant shall at the time of taking an appeal file with the court a bond of recognizance
4 to the state, with surety to prosecute the appeal to effect and to comply with the orders and decrees
5 of the court in the premises. These appeals are preferred cases, to be heard, unless cause appears to
6 the contrary, in priority to other cases. The court may grant relief as may be equitable. If the court
7 determines that the appeal was taken without probable cause, the court may tax double or triple
8 costs, as the case demands; and, upon all those appeals, which may be denied, costs may be taxed
9 against the appellant at the discretion of the court. In no case shall costs be taxed against the state,
10 its officers, or agents. A party aggrieved by a final order of the court may seek review of the order
11 in the supreme court by writ of certiorari in accordance with the procedures contained in § 42-35-
12 16.
13 44-20.3-13. Claim for refund.

17 the tax administrator and with the approval of the director of revenue, pay the refund from any
18 monies in the treasury not appropriated without any further act or resolution making appropriation
19 for the refund. No refund is allowed unless a claim is filed with the tax administrator within three

21 44-20.3-14. Administration — Forms — Rules and regulations.
22 The tax administrator is authorized to promulgate rules and regulations to carry out the
23 provisions, policies, and purposes of this chapter. The provisions of this chapter shall be liberally
24 construed to foster the enforcement of and compliance with all provisions herein related to taxation.
25 Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the tax administrator may make available to an
26 authorized agent of the department of health and the attorney general any information that the
27 administrator may consider proper contained in tax reports or returns or any audit or the report of
28 any investigation made with respect to them, filed pursuant to the tax laws of this state, to whom
29 disclosure is necessary for the purpose of ensuring compliance with state law and regulations.
30 44-20.3-15. Severability.
31 The provisions of this chapter are declared to be severable; and in case any part, section,
32 or provision of this chapter is held void by any court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining parts,
33 sections, and provisions of the chapter are not impaired or affected.
