3 provided that total full time equivalent positions are within the authorized cap and all these
4 personnel are assigned exclusively to the schools. The hiring of individuals on a contract basis shall
5 be subject to state purchasing requirements. All non-classified employees of the board of regents
6 who shall have twenty (20) years, not necessarily consecutive, of service credit, these credits having

22 collectively bargain pursuant to chapters 11 of title 36 and chapter 7 of title 28 over all terms and
23 conditions of employment including, but not limited to, salaries, terms of service, and dismissal, or
