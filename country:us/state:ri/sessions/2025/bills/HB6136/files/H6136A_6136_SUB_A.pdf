7 housing pursuant to the provisions of chapter 53 of title 45 and the town of West Greenwich code
8 of ordinances, the town council of the town of West Greenwich may vote to authorize, subject to
9 the conditions in this section, to exempt from payment, in whole or in part, real qualified property,
10 or to determine a stabilized amount, notwithstanding the valuation of the property or the rate of tax,
11 provided that after a public hearing, ten (10) days' notice of which shall be published in a newspaper
12 of general circulation in the town, and upon a determination by the town council that the granting
13 of the exemption and/or stabilization of taxes for a qualified property shall inure to the benefit of
14 the town of West Greenwich including, without limitation, by reason of the town of West
15 Greenwich achieving, exceeding, or furthering its realization of its goal of ten percent (10%) of its
16 year round housing units constituting low- and moderate-income housing units pursuant to the
17 provisions of chapter 53 of title 45.
18 (b) For purposes of this section, "qualifying property" means property for which there is
19 an approved comprehensive permit project pursuant to chapter 53 of title 45, in which final plan

1 approval has been recorded. Qualified property may be comprised of one or more contiguous lots

5 recorded.
6 (c) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the town council may vote to
7 authorize an agreement under this section for a period of up to thirty (30) years.
8 (d) Except as otherwise provided in this section, property for which taxes have been
9 exempted and/or stabilized, in whole or in part, pursuant to this section shall not, during the period
10 for which taxes have been so exempted and/or stabilized, be further liable to taxation by the town

16 provisions of ยง44-5-13.11, the town council's grant of exemption and/or stabilization under this
17 section shall result in taxation of such qualifying low-income housing that is no less favorable than
