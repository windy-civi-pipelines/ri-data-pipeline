EXPLANATION
BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL
OF
A N A C T
RELATING TO HUMAN SERVICES -- MEDICAL ASSISTANCE
***
1 This act would authorize the executive office of health and human services (EOHHS) to
2 establish a program, on or after July 1, 2025, to establish comprehensive coverage for treatment of
3 obesity, including prescription treatments for certain individuals where there is a clinical need. This
4 program would seek to receive expanded authority to provide FDA-approved anti-obesity
5 medication when medically appropriate. The executive office would seek a Medicaid section 1115
6 demonstration waiver request and renewal to a seek waiver of the compliance provisions of 42
7 U.S.C. section 1396d(a) ("definitions"), as set forth in subsection (b) of this resolution.
