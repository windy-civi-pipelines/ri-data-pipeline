17 (5) “MERV” means minimum efficiency reporting value.
18 (6) “PM2.5” means particles less than two and one-half (2.5) micrometers in diameter.
19 (7) “PM10” means particles less than ten (10) micrometers in diameter.

1 (8) “Qualified adjusting personnel” means either of the following:
2 (i) A certified testing, adjusting, and balancing (TAB) technician; or
3 (ii) A skilled and trained workforce under the supervision of a certified TAB technician.
4 (9) "Qualified testing personnel” means a certified TAB technician or a person certified to

12 (11) “Verification” means the process of evaluating a system, component, or product to
13 determine whether it complies with specified requirements, design specifications, or regulations.
14 (b) The department of health shall establish guidelines for indoor air quality in schools,
15 including recommended thresholds and/or rates for the following:
16 (1) Temperature;
17 (2) Humidity;
18 (3) Carbon dioxide;
19 (4) PM2.5;
20 (5) PM10;
21 (6) Ventilation; and
22 (7) Filtration.
23 (c) The department of education school building authority, as part of the needs survey
24 outlined in § 16-105-3, shall undertake a uniform inspection and evaluation of the indoor air quality

31 construction workforce at least once every five (5) years. The assessment shall include, but not be
32 limited to, the following:
33 (1) Measurements of temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, PM2.5, and PM10;
34 (2) Testing for maximum filter efficiency aiming for MERV 13 when feasible;
LC002707 - Page 2 of 4

1 (3) Assessment of MERV filter level and replacement routine;
2 (4) Measurements of outside air delivery rate;
3 (5) Verification of the condition and operation of ventilation components, pursuant to
4 specifications provided by the manufacturer;
5 (6) Verification of unit operation and that required maintenance has been performed;
6 (7) Verification of control sequences;
7 (8) Measurement of all air distribution inlets and outlets;
8 (9) Verification, replacement or installation of carbon dioxide sensors; and
9 (10) Collection of field data for the installation of mechanical ventilation system or HVAC
10 system if none exists.
11 (d) The department of education shall make the inspection and evaluation results easily
12 available online and send the test results directly to:
13 (1) Each school's principal;
14 (2) The department of elementary and secondary education; and
15 (3) The appropriate local school board.
16 (e) All schools with HVAC systems shall install filtration that achieves MERV levels of
17 thirteen (13) for existing HVAC systems, as determined by the school board, in accordance with
18 ASHRAE Standard 62.1- 2022 § 8 and Table 8–1. If it is determined by the school board that the
