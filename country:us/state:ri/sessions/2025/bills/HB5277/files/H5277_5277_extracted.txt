30 "Voter Choice Act" are hereby amended to read as follows:
31 17-29-2. Legislative declaration.

1 (2) In an election where more than two (2) candidates are running for an office, the
2 candidate who receives a plurality of the votes may actually be opposed by the majority of voters.
3 (3) The state’s current voting method limits voters’ choices and contributes to lower voter
4 participation.
5 (4) It is in the public interest to examine Rhode Island’s voting method and consider
6 comprehensive reforms that would expand the choices realistically available to voters, increase
7 participation, address the concerns of the major political parties, save money, and increase
8 accountability.
9 (b) The general assembly further finds and declares that instant runoff voting and other
10 advanced voting methods have the potential to:
11 (1) Expand the range of choices available to voters by allowing them to vote for candidates
12 of minor political parties or unaffiliated candidates without fear of giving an advantage to the
13 candidate they least prefer;
14 (2) Reduce both election administration costs and campaign expenditures by combining
15 primary general and general elections; and

24 voting method” includes, but is not limited to, instant runoff voting, approval voting, range voting,
25 and proportional voting.
26 (c) The voter choice study commission shall consist of sixteen (16) members selected as

5 (1) Study advanced voting methods;
6 (2) Analyze the requirements for implementing advanced voting methods, including public
7 education, voting equipment and technology, ballot designs, the costs of conducting the pilot

13 (5) Recommend statutory changes to implement advanced voting methods in elections for
14 state and federal offices to be held in the state in 2014;

24 comply with this section. There shall also be transferred to the board any additional sums that may
25 be required until the permitted limits are reached. The board shall account for all funds disbursed
26 pursuant to this chapter and transfer upon the conclusion of any election for general office any and
27 all undisbursed sums to the general treasurer for deposit in the general fund by December 1 in any
28 year in which the election is held.
29 SECTION 17. Sections 17-29-2 and 17-29-3 of the General Laws in Chapter 17-29 entitled
30 "Voter Choice Act" are hereby amended to read as follows:
31 17-29-2. Legislative declaration.
32 (a) The general assembly hereby finds and declares that:
33 (1) Majority rule is a fundamental principle of representative democracy, and the state’s
34 election laws should uphold and facilitate this principle.
LC000304 - Page 44 of 48

1 (2) In an election where more than two (2) candidates are running for an office, the
2 candidate who receives a plurality of the votes may actually be opposed by the majority of voters.
3 (3) The state’s current voting method limits voters’ choices and contributes to lower voter
4 participation.
5 (4) It is in the public interest to examine Rhode Island’s voting method and consider
6 comprehensive reforms that would expand the choices realistically available to voters, increase
7 participation, address the concerns of the major political parties, save money, and increase
8 accountability.
9 (b) The general assembly further finds and declares that instant runoff voting and other
10 advanced voting methods have the potential to:
11 (1) Expand the range of choices available to voters by allowing them to vote for candidates
12 of minor political parties or unaffiliated candidates without fear of giving an advantage to the
13 candidate they least prefer;
14 (2) Reduce both election administration costs and campaign expenditures by combining
15 primary general and general elections; and
16 (3) Promote campaigns that are more positive and focused on issues because candidates
17 will seek to appeal to opponents’ supporters as a second choice.
18 17-29-3. Voter choice study commission — Established — Definitions.
19 (a) The voter choice study commission is hereby established for the purpose of studying
20 instant runoff voting and other advanced voting methods.
21 (b) As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires, “Advanced voting
22 method” means a voting method that allows an elector to indicate a preference for more than one
23 candidate in an election and that determines the winner of the election by majority vote. “Advanced
24 voting method” includes, but is not limited to, instant runoff voting, approval voting, range voting,
25 and proportional voting.
26 (c) The voter choice study commission shall consist of sixteen (16) members selected as
27 follows:
28 (1) Eight (8) members to be appointed by the speaker of the house, no more than five (5)
29 of whom shall be from the same political party, and at least three (3) of whom shall be the clerk of
30 a city or town of this state;
31 (2) Eight (8) members to be appointed by the president of the senate, no more than five (5)
32 of whom shall be from the same political party, at least three (3) of whom shall be the clerk of a
33 city or town of this state; and
34 (3) Provided, that all members of the study commission shall be registered voters of this
LC000304 - Page 45 of 48

1 state at the time of their selection and at all times while they remain on said study group.
2 (d) Members of the voter choice study group shall be appointed no later than August 1,
3 2012.
4 (e) The voter choice study commission shall:
5 (1) Study advanced voting methods;
6 (2) Analyze the requirements for implementing advanced voting methods, including public
7 education, voting equipment and technology, ballot designs, the costs of conducting the pilot
8 project established by this chapter and using advanced voting methods in elections for state and
9 federal offices, and savings due to the elimination of primary general elections;
10 (3) Determine the level of public support for a change in voting methods;
11 (4) Review the experience of other states in conducting elections using advanced voting
12 methods;
13 (5) Recommend statutory changes to implement advanced voting methods in elections for
14 state and federal offices to be held in the state in 2014;
15 (6) Make recommendations on making all voting systems used in the state compatible with
16 advanced voting methods by 2014, including a review of the availability and costs of necessary
17 voting equipment;
18 (7) Make recommendations to the governing bodies and designated election officials of
19 political subdivisions of the state on preparing to conduct an election using an advanced voting
20 methods; and
21 (8) Consider changes to the state’s statutes governing access to the ballot for presidential
22 candidates.
23 (f) The voter choice study commission shall present a report on its work to the general
24 assembly, the governor, and the secretary of state no later than November 1, 2013.
25 (g) The director of research of the legislative council and the director of the office of
26 legislative legal services shall provide staff assistance to the voter choice study commission.
27 (h) The members of the voter choice study commission shall serve without compensation;
28 except that the members shall be reimbursed for necessary expenses incurred in the performance
29 of their duties.
30 SECTION 18. Section 17-13-1 of the General Laws in Chapter 17-13 entitled "Primary
31 Voting Lists" is hereby repealed.
32 17-13-1. Preparation and posting of preliminary lists.
33 (a) In conformity with the requirements of chapter 10 of this title relating to preliminary

1 each local board shall, for the party, prepare and post in the local board of canvassers a separate list
2 of voters with their addresses in the districts who are eligible to participate in the primary of the
3 respective party in accordance with the provisions of chapter 15 of this title. Each list shall be
4 plainly marked with the name of the party for which it is prepared.
5 (b) In the preparation of any preliminary list, the names of all persons who are ineligible
6 by reason of the provisions of § 17-15-24 shall be stricken from the list, and those persons are
7 debarred from participating in the primary.
8 SECTION 19. Section 17-15-6 of the General Laws in Chapter 17-15 entitled "Primary
9 Elections" is hereby repealed.
10 17-15-6. Conventions and caucuses replaced — Parties holding primaries — Forms.
11 The primary elections held pursuant to this chapter shall replace the party conventions and
12 caucuses for making the nominations provided for in this title, but party conventions shall be held

14 Except as otherwise provided in this title, any and all forms prescribed by this chapter shall be
15 prepared and provided by the secretary of state and shall be, wherever practicable, uniform
