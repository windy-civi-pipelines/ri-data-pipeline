REQUESTING THAT THE CANNABIS CONTROL COMMISSION PROVIDE THE
GENERAL ASSEMBLY WITH RECOMMENDATIONS ON LEGISLATION TO REGULATE
AND LICENSE CANNABINOIDS AND HEMP-DERIVED BEVERAGES
Introduced By: Senators Britto, McKenney, Dimitri, Ciccone, Felag, Murray, Patalano,
and Thompson
Date Introduced: April 16, 2025
Referred To: Senate Judiciary
1 WHEREAS, The legalization of adult-use cannabis in the State of Rhode Island has
2 created a regulated framework for the cultivation, processing, sale, and consumption of cannabis
3 products; and
4 WHEREAS, The Rhode Island Cannabis Act established the Rhode Island Cannabis
5 Control Commission to oversee and implement rules and regulations for the safe and responsible
6 use of cannabis and cannabis-derived products; and
7 WHEREAS, Hemp THC-infused beverages are a new emerging category of cannabis
8 products in many legal jurisdictions, offering consumers a smokeless alternative to traditional
9 cannabis consumption; and
10 WHEREAS, As intoxicating products, hemp THC-infused beverages warrant careful
11 study and monitoring to better understand their short- and long-term effects on individual health
12 and behavior, particularly with respect to public health outcomes and the potential risks they pose
13 to juveniles if not properly regulated and restricted; and
14 WHEREAS, Hemp THC-infused beverages can impair judgment, coordination, and
15 perception, and as such, strict rules and regulations governing their age-appropriate use are
16 essential to prevent underage consumption and protect public health and safety; and
17 WHEREAS, Rhode Island's cannabis and hemp entrepreneurs require clear, consistent
18 guidance to participate in the emerging hemp THC-infused beverage market to ensure compliance
19 with regulations designed to enable sales of hemp THC-infused beverages while protecting public

1 health and safety; and
2 WHEREAS, Hemp THC-infused beverages should only be sold by properly regulated
3 venues equipped to verify age and ensure responsible dispensing, in order to prevent misuse,
4 diversion, and access by underage individuals; and
5 WHEREAS, Establishing equitable and transparent rules around production, potency,
6 distribution, and wholesale and retail sales will empower local small businesses, foster
7 innovation, and ensure broad participation in the regulated cannabis economy; and
8 WHEREAS, A unified regulatory framework for both cannabis and hemp products -
9 including hemp THC-infused beverages - would reduce confusion, promote compliance, and
10 better protect public health and safety; now, therefore be it
11 RESOLVED, That the General Assembly hereby requests that prior to March 1, 2026, the
12 Cannabis Control Commission, pursuant to its authority under section 21-28.11-4, consult with
13 medical experts and appropriate state agencies and departments including the Department of
14 Health, the Department of Revenue, and the Department of Business Regulation in devising
15 recommendations regarding dosage limits, packaging standards, labeling requirements, licensing
16 conditions, and appropriate age requirements and other safeguards against underage access as
17 well as study optimal procedures in other states that have undertaken regulation of ingestible
18 hemp products; and be it further
19 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
20 transmit duly certified copies of this resolution to Commissioners Kim Ahern, Layi Oduyingbo,
21 and Robert Jacquard of the Cannabis Control Commission, Administrator Michelle Reddish of
22 the Cannabis Control Commission, and the Director of the Department of Business Regulation.
