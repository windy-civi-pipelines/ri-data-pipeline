2 in speech or expressive activity protected under the first amendment of the U.S. Constitution, unless
3 the board demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that the practitioner’s speech was the direct
4 cause of physical harm to a person with whom the health care practitioner had a practitioner-patient
5 relationship within the three (3) years immediately preceding the incident of physical harm.
6 (1) The board of medical licensure and discipline shall provide a medical practitioner with

13 (a) Civil action for violation of right of conscience. A civil action for damages or injunctive
14 relief, or both, may be brought by any medical practitioner, healthcare institution, or healthcare
15 payer for any violation of this chapter. Any additional burden or expense on another medical
16 practitioner, healthcare institution, or healthcare payer arising from the exercise of the right of
17 conscience shall not be a defense to any violation of this chapter. However, no civil action may be
18 brought against an individual who declines to use or purchase medical procedure or services from
19 a specific medical practitioner, healthcare institution, or healthcare payer for exercising the rights
20 set forth in § 23-104-3.
21 (b) Other remedies. Any party aggrieved by any violation of this chapter may commence a
22 civil action and upon a finding of a violation, shall be entitled to recover threefold their actual
23 damages sustained, along with the costs of the action and reasonable attorneys' fees. Such damages
24 shall be cumulative and in no way limited by any other remedies which may be available under any
25 other federal, state, or municipal law. A court considering such civil action may also award
26 injunction relief, which may include, but it not limited to, reinstatement of a medical practitioner
27 to their previous position, reinstatement of board certification, and re-licensure of a healthcare
28 institution or healthcare payer.
29 23-104-6. Severability.
30 Any provision of this chapter held to be invalid or unenforceable by its terms, or as applied
31 to any person or circumstance, shall be construed so as to give it the maximum effect permitted by
32 law, unless such holding shall be one of utter invalidity or unenforceability, in which event such
33 provision shall be deemed severable herefrom and shall not affect the remainder hereof or the
34 application of such provision to other persons not similarly situated or to other, dissimilar
