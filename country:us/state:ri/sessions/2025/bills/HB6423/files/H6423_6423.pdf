It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Section 17-9.1-7 of the General Laws in Chapter 17-9.1 entitled "Registration
2 of Voters" is hereby amended to read as follows:
3 17-9.1-7. Registration at the division of motor vehicles — Additional agencies.
4 (a) Every person applying at the division of motor vehicles for a driver’s license or a
5 renewal of the license, or personal identification document issued by the division of motor vehicles,
6 and who is or may be by the next general election qualified to vote, shall be registered to vote, or
7 if previously registered, be afforded the opportunity to change their address for voting purposes.
8 (b)(1) The division of motor vehicles shall identify each person applying for or renewing
9 a REAL ID driver's license or REAL ID personal identification document who provides an
10 identification document with such application that demonstrates United States citizenship and who
11 is of sufficient age to register to vote. The division of motor vehicles may identify such persons by
12 reviewing records of identification documents maintained by the division of motor vehicles that
13 demonstrate United States citizenship provided as part of a previous REAL ID licensing or
14 identification application. The division of motor vehicles may identify each person identifying or
15 renewing a standard driver’s license or standard personal identification document who provides an
16 identification document with such application that demonstrates United States citizenship and who
17 is of sufficient age to register to vote. Submission of such a document shall be considered a
18 certification of citizenship, pursuant to § 17-9.1-11.
19 (2) Each such applicant's name, residence address, mailing address, if different from their

1 residence address, date of birth, and registrant's signature and date of affixation of signature, and
2 any other information requested by the secretary of state, shall be transmitted by the division of
3 motor vehicles to the statewide central voter registration system, mandated pursuant to § 17-6-1.2,
4 not later than the next business day after the date of acceptance of the provided information by the
5 division of motor vehicles. Transmission shall be made by electronic means, as prescribed by the
6 secretary of state, and shall be in an electronic form, compatible with the voter registration system
7 maintained by the secretary of state. If the person is not registered to vote at the address which
8 appears in the electronic record, the secretary of state shall forward such electronic record to the
9 local board of the city or town of the applicant's residence. The secretary of state may adopt rules
10 to facilitate the administration of voter registration under this section.
11 (3) Notice shall be sent by mail to each such applicant that the applicant shall be registered
12 to vote or, if already registered, then the address on the registration record shall be updated. The
13 notice shall include information on how the applicant may decline to become registered to vote or
14 decline to update their registration address, and on how to affiliate with a political party or update
15 their affiliation. Any applicant who does not so decline within fourteen (14) days of such mailing,
16 shall be registered or the registration record shall be updated. The mailing required by this section,
17 may be combined with the contents of an acknowledgement of registration or change of address,
18 pursuant to § 17-9.1-25, and if so combined, shall serve as acknowledgement of registration or
19 change of address, that shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of § 17-9.1-25 if the recipient
20 does not decline to register to vote or change their address within fourteen (14) days of such
21 mailing. Any person who declines to register under this subsection, shall be removed from the
22 central voter registration system and deemed not to have submitted an application to register to
23 vote. The information transmitted pursuant to subsection (b)(2) of this section shall be deemed
24 confidential and shall not be open to public inspection or copying or included on any public
25 registration list, until after fourteen (14) days of such mailing.
26 (4) The division of motor vehicles may obtain information from the secretary of state
27 regarding the voter registration status of persons applying for a driver’s license or renewal or
28 change of address of it or a personal identification document. If the information from the secretary
29 of state is available to the division of motor vehicles during the licensing transaction, and the
30 information indicates that such applicant is on the active or inactive voter list, the applicant’s
31 information shall be processed as a registration update by the division of motor vehicles and the
32 secretary of state, under the procedures set forth in subsections (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section
33 whether or not the applicant satisfies the conditions of subsection (b)(1) of this section.
34 (5) The procedures set forth in subsections (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section shall not

1 apply to an applicant who is requesting or is renewing a license that contains the applicant's official
2 business address, in lieu of a residence address, as provided in § 31-10-26(d). The division of motor
3 vehicles shall provide such applicant with a voter registration opportunity, under the procedures set
4 forth in subsection (c) of this section.
5 (6) The division of motor vehicles, in consultation with the secretary of state, may provide
6 applicants under subsection (b) of this section with appropriate notices and instructions regarding
7 the voter registration procedures set forth in subsection (b) of this section.
8 (b)(c) For each person applying for a driver's license or renewal of it or a personal
9 identification document who is not an applicant under subsection (b) of this section, and who is of
10 sufficient age to register to vote, the division of motor vehicles shall provide such person with an
11 application to register to vote under the procedures set forth in this subsection. The application to
12 register to vote must be offered simultaneously with the application for the driver’s license or
13 renewal of it or personal identification document. Division of motor vehicles employees must
14 provide to applicants for driver’s licenses, license renewal, or personal identification documents
15 the same level of assistance and instruction with respect to the application to register to vote as is
16 provided with respect to the application for driver’s licenses, renewal of the license, or personal
17 identification documents; provided, that one signature may be sufficient on the application for
18 driver’s license, renewal of the license, or personal identification document and the application to
19 register to vote. The applicant shall be afforded the opportunity to decline certify their United States
20 citizenship to register to vote. If previously registered, the applicant shall be afforded the
21 opportunity to change his or her address for voting purposes. In order to protect the privacy of
22 those who do not wish to register to vote for any reason, the failure of an applicant for a driver’s
23 license or renewal of it or a personal identification document to register to vote may not be used
24 for any purposes other than to determine the person’s voter registration status.
25 (c)(d)(1) The voter registration application, pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, shall
26 contain the registrant’s name, residence address, mailing address if different from residence
27 address, date of birth, and registrant’s signature and date of affixation of signature, and may include
28 any other information, certifications, and declarations, including those made under the penalty of
29 perjury, that may be required by the state board in order to administer a single and unified system
30 of voter registration in accordance with applicable state and federal laws that shall enable duly
31 registered voters to vote in all elections in their respective voting districts including, elections for
32 federal officers. The voter registration application must also include, in print identical to that used

25 not be offered an opportunity to register to vote, and the division of motor vehicles shall not transfer
26 the record of such applicant, pursuant to subsections (b) or (c) of this section.
