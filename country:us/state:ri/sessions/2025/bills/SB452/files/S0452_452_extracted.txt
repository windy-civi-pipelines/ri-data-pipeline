16 grades six (6) through eight (8) in the case of a kindergarten through grade eight (K-8) schools, or
17 grade six (6) in the case of a grade five (5) and grade (6) school, the state shall cover the cost of

RELATING TO EDUCATION -- FEDERAL AID
***
1 This act would establish a statewide “healthy school meals for all” universal school
2 breakfast and lunch program in Rhode Island public schools phased in over three (3) years. The
3 program would begin with all elementary school students, then add all middle school students in
4 year two (2), and then provide universal meals for all students by the 2027-2028 school year. The
5 act would also direct that in operating its school breakfast and lunch program, each public
6 educational entity would seek to maximize access to federal funds for the cost of the school
7 breakfast and lunch program by participating in one of several identified federal programs in order
8 to obtain federal funds to offset the costs to districts of providing free breakfasts and lunches and
9 minimize the costs to the state. The general assembly would be required to make an appropriation
10 by separate line items in the budget to provide breakfast and lunch at no charge for children in state
11 subsidized early childhood education programs.
12 This act would take effect on July 1, 2026.
