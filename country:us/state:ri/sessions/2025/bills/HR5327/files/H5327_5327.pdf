Date Introduced: February 06, 2025
Referred To: House read and passed
1 WHEREAS, The Freedmen’s Aid Society was founded in 1859, with the American Civil
2 War looming, by the American Missionary Association (AMA), a group predominantly supported
3 by the Congregational, Presbyterian, and Methodist churches in the North, with a mission of
4 educating recently freed slaves and advocating for their rights; and
5 WHEREAS, The Freedmen’s Aid Society organized a group of teachers from the North
6 and set them up to teach in schools in the South for freedmen, who were recently freed slaves,
7 and their children. The Freedmen’s Aid Society also provided them with basic necessities such as
8 food and clothing. The AMA founded more than 500 such schools and colleges in the South, and
9 as a result, many freedmen became educated and went on to serve their communities as teachers,
10 nurses, and in other professional positions; and
11 WHEREAS, These Freedmen's schools were open to men, women and children in the
12 South, and by the turn of the century, the literacy rate for African-Americans had been
13 significantly increased; now, therefore be it
14 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
15 proclaims February 6th, 2025, to be "New England Freedmen’s Aid Society Day" in the State of
16 Rhode Island; and be it further

1 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed
2 to transmit a duly certified copy of this resolution to the Rhode Island NAACP.
