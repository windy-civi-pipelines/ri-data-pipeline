11 coverage for medically necessary services for failure to obtain a prior authorization, if a medical
12 necessity determination can be made after the rehabilitative or habilitative services have been
13 provided and the services would have been covered benefits if prior authorization had been
14 obtained.
15 (f) An individual or group health insurance plan’s failure to approve a prior authorization
16 for all rehabilitative or habilitative services or visits in a plan of care is subject to the same appeal
17 rights as a denial under the health insurance commissioner’s rule regarding health plan
18 accountability and the provider's network agreement with the carrier, if any.
19 (g) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit an individual or group health
20 insurance plan from performing a retrospective medical necessity review.
21 SECTION 4. Chapter 27-41 of the General Laws entitled "Health Maintenance
22 Organizations" is hereby amended by adding thereto the following section:
23 27-41-100. Prior authorization restrictions for rehabilitative and habilitative services.
24 (a) An individual or group health insurance plan shall not require prior authorization for
25 rehabilitative or habilitative services including, but not limited to, physical therapy or occupational
26 therapy services for the first twelve (12) visits of each new episode of care. After the twelve (12)
27 visits of each new episode of care, an individual or group health insurance plan may not require
28 prior authorization more frequently than every six (6) visits or every thirty (30) days, whichever
29 time period is longer. For purposes of this section, "new episode of care" means treatment for a
30 new or recurring condition for which an insured has not been treated by the provider within the
31 previous ninety (90) days.
32 (b) An individual or group health insurance plan shall not require prior authorization for
33 physical medicine or rehabilitation services provided to patients with chronic pain for the first
34 ninety (90) days following diagnosis in order to provide the necessary nonpharmacologic

1 management of the pain. After the first ninety (90) days following a chronic pain diagnosis, an
2 individual or group health insurance plan may not require prior authorization more frequently than
3 every six (6) visits or every thirty (30) days, whichever time period is longer. For purposes of this
4 subsection, "chronic pain" means pain that persists or recurs for more than three (3) months.
5 (c) An individual or group health insurance plan shall respond to a prior authorization
6 request for services or visits in an ongoing plan of care for rehabilitative or habilitative services
7 within twenty-four (24) hours. If an individual or group health insurance plan requires more
8 information to render a decision on the prior authorization request, the individual or group health
9 insurance plan shall notify the patient and the provider within twenty-four (24) hours of the initial
10 request with the information that is needed to complete the prior authorization request including,
11 but not limited to, the specific tests and measures needed from the patient and provider. An
12 individual or group health insurance plan shall render a decision on the prior authorization request
13 within twenty-four (24) hours of receiving the requested information.
14 (d) A prior authorization for rehabilitative or habilitative services is deemed to be approved
15 if an individual or group health insurance plan:
16 (1) Fails to timely answer a prior authorization request in accordance with subsection (c)
17 of this section, including due to a failure of the individual or group health insurance plan’s prior
18 authorization platform or process; or
19 (2) Informs a provider that prior authorization is not required orally, via an online platform
20 or program, through the patient's health plan documents or by any other means.
21 (e) An individual or group health insurance plan shall provide a procedure for providers
22 and insureds to obtain retroactive authorization for rehabilitative or habilitative services that are
23 medically necessary covered benefits. An individual or group health insurance plan shall not deny
24 coverage for medically necessary services for failure to obtain a prior authorization, if a medical
25 necessity determination can be made after the rehabilitative or habilitative services have been
26 provided and the services would have been covered benefits if prior authorization had been
27 obtained.
28 (f) An individual or group health insurance plan’s failure to approve a prior authorization
29 for all rehabilitative or habilitative services or visits in a plan of care is subject to the same appeal
30 rights as a denial under the health insurance commissioner’s rule regarding health plan
31 accountability and the provider's network agreement with the carrier, if any.
32 (g) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit an individual or group health
33 insurance plan from performing a retrospective medical necessity review.
