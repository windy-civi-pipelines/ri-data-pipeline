INDEPENDENCE DAY AND CELEBRATING DEMOCRACY IN GREECE AND THE
UNITED STATES
Introduced By: Senators Raptakis, Gallo, Euer, Lawson, Tikoian, de la Cruz, Urso,
Felag, Patalano, and Burke
Date Introduced: March 25, 2025
Referred To: Recommended for Immediate Consideration
1 WHEREAS, On March 25, 1821, the Feast Day of the Annunciation, the Greek nation
2 reclaimed its ancient heritage as the "Cradle of Democracy" by overthrowing the yoke of
3 oppression which had enslaved its people since the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Conquered by
4 the Ottoman Turks in the 15th century, Greece waged a successful war of Independence (1821-
5 1829) and re-instituted a democratic form of government; and
6 WHEREAS, The People of the United States generously offered humanitarian assistance
7 to the Greek people during their struggle for independence; and
8 WHEREAS, The price for the people of Greece to hold onto their common values in their
9 region was high, as hundreds of thousands of civilians were killed in Greece during World War
10 II; and
11 WHEREAS, Greece is one of only three nations in the world, beyond the former British
12 Empire, that has been allied with the United States in every major international conflict over the
13 last 100 years; and
14 WHEREAS, Greece, located in a region where Christianity meets Islam and Judaism,
15 maintains excellent relations with Muslim nations and Israel, and demonstrates religious
16 tolerance; and
17 WHEREAS, The Ancient Macedonians were Hellenes and the northern Province of
18 Greece, Macedonia and the Hellenic descendants; and
19 WHEREAS, Greece and the United States are at the forefront of the effort for freedom,
1 democracy, peace, stability, and human rights; and
2 WHEREAS, Many American Philhellenes participated and fought in the Greek War of
3 Independence. One such individual was George Wilson from Providence, Rhode Island, who
4 served as a gunman in the Greek fleet, most notably in the battle against the Turkish Navy in
5 Nafpaktos Bay, Greece; and
6 WHEREAS, United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio recently met with Greek
7 Foreign Minister Giorgos Gerapetritis and reaffirmed the strategic importance of the US-Greece
8 Partnership and stated that "Greece is a valued NATO ally and is critical to regional stability."
9 Secretary Rubio went on to say that "The United States applauds Greece's strong commitment to
10 defense spending, its regional leadership, including its continued support for Ukraine, delivery of
11 life-saving humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza, and its support for freedom of navigation
12 in the Red Sea through its participation in operation Prosperity Guardian." Secretary Rubio also
13 welcomed Greece's presence on the UN Security Council for its 2025-2026 term; now, therefore
14 be it
15 RESOLVED, That this Senate of the State of Rhode Island hereby celebrates March 25,
16 2025, as the 204th Anniversary of Greek Independence, reaffirms Rhode Island's abiding
17 commitment to the magnificent principles of democracy and religious freedom, and urges Turkey
18 to respect the rights and religious freedoms of the Ecumenical Patriarchate; and be it further
19 RESOLVED, That this Senate hereby commends the Greek-American community for its
20 contributions to Rhode Island and its role as a bridge between two countries; and be it further
21 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
22 transmit duly certified copies of this resolution to the Annunciation Greek Orthodox Church of
23 Cranston, the Assumption Greek Orthodox Church of Pawtucket, the St. Spyridon Greek
24 Orthodox Church of Newport, members of the Rhode Island Congressional delegation, the
25 Honorable Symeon Tegos, Consul General of the Hellenic Republic in Boston, and Archbishop
