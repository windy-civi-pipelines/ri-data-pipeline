It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Section 43-4-18 of the General Laws in Chapter 43-4 entitled "Effect of

7 contained in the reenactment of these titles shall be annually brought to the attention of the general
8 assembly in a “Statutes and Statutory Construction” bill, prepared by the law revision office, for
9 general assembly approval or disapproval. The office of law revision shall also identify, on a yearly
10 basis, any United States Supreme Court decisions or rulings that would require amendments to any
11 state statutes or general laws, and shall so inform each chamber of those decisions or rulings.
12 (b) The reenacted sections of the general laws shall be construed as continuations of
13 previously enacted public laws and all rights and remedies remain in effect as defined in this
14 chapter.
15 (c) In case of any conflict between an act passed at an annual or special session of the
16 general assembly and an amendment adopted as a part of a reenactment or the “Statutes and
17 Statutory Construction” bill referred to in subsection (a) of this section, the former shall be
18 controlling regardless of respective dates of passage or approval.

1 (d) The provisions in titles that have been amended and corrected as “reenactments” shall
2 take effect and go into operation on and after December 31 of the calendar year of their reenactment.
3 (e) The enactment of this section and the repeal of sections in chapter 4 of title 43 adopted
4 prior to the date of enactment of this chapter of the public laws shall not act as a repeal of those
5 chapters of the public laws which have been adopted to reenact the general laws.
6 (f) Any subsequent reenactments shall be recorded in the history of this section.
7 (g) In any reenactment, the word “text” as used in the general laws does not include: (1)
8 printer’s reference lines appearing at the top or bottom of any galley proof; (2) title or chapter
9 heading (except the numbers of said titles and chapters); (3) tables of contents appearing at the
10 beginning of the titles and chapters; or (4) boldface captions appearing at the beginning of sections
11 (except the numbers of said sections), except insofar as the title or chapter headings or boldface
12 captions are necessary for clarification of any statutory text.
13 SECTION 2. This act shall take effect upon passage.
