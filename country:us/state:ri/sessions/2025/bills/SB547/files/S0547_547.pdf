13 endorsement. Provided, however, that the college or university shall operate the shuttle service and
14 there shall be no specific charge for the transportation of students or employees. The division of
15 motor vehicles shall not issue a chauffeur’s license for either purpose unless the applicant has had
16 at least one year of driving experience prior to the application, and has filed with the division of

16 of motor vehicles shall conduct a search of that person’s motor vehicle record. Any violation of
17 any safety regulation or conviction of any motor vehicle law in this or any other state shall be
18 grounds for refusing to issue a certificate.
