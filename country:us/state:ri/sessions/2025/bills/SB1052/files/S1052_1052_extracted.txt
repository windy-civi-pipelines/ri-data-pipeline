22 than are permitted by the use regulations of a zoning ordinance is nonconformity by use; or
23 (ii) Nonconforming by dimension: a building, structure, or parcel of land not in compliance
24 with the dimensional regulations of the zoning ordinance. Dimensional regulations include all
25 regulations of the zoning ordinance, other than those pertaining to the permitted uses. A building
26 or structure containing more dwelling units than are permitted by the use regulations of a zoning
27 ordinance is nonconforming by use; a building or structure containing a permitted number of
28 dwelling units by the use regulations of the zoning ordinance, but not meeting the lot area per
29 dwelling unit regulations, is nonconforming by dimension.

30 establishment or maintenance of a use of land, that is prohibited by a zoning ordinance. There are
31 only two (2) categories of variance, a use variance or a dimensional variance.
32 (i) Use variance. Permission to depart from the use requirements of a zoning ordinance
33 where the applicant for the requested variance has shown by evidence upon the record that the
34 subject land or structure cannot yield any beneficial use if it is to conform to the provisions of the
LC002868 - Page 15 of 21
1 zoning ordinance.
2 (ii) Dimensional variance. Permission to depart from the dimensional requirements of a

19 complies with the provisions of this chapter.
20 (75) Zoning use district. The basic unit in zoning, either mapped or unmapped, to which a
21 uniform set of regulations applies, or a uniform set of regulations for a specified use. Zoning use
22 districts include, but are not limited to: agricultural, commercial, industrial, institutional, open
23 space, and residential. Each district may include sub-districts. Districts may be combined.
24 45-24-38. General provisions — Substandard lots of record.
25 (a) Any city or town adopting or amending a zoning ordinance under this chapter shall
26 regulate the development of any single substandard lot of record or contiguous lots of record at the
27 effective date of adoption or amendment of the zoning ordinance.
28 (b) Notwithstanding the failure of that lot or those lots to meet the dimensional and/or
29 quantitative requirements, and/or road frontage or other access requirements, applicable in the
30 district as stated in the ordinance, a substandard lot of record shall not be required to seek any
31 zoning relief based solely on the failure to meet minimum lot size requirements of the district in
32 which such lot is located. For any structure proposed under this section on a substandard lot of
33 record, the following dimensional regulations shall apply:
34 (1) Minimum building setbacks, lot frontage, and lot width requirements for a lot that is
LC002868 - Page 16 of 21
1 nonconforming in area shall be reduced by applying the building setback, lot frontage, and lot width
2 requirements from another zoning district in the municipality in which the subject lot would be
3 conforming as to lot area. If the subject lot is not conforming as to lot area in any zoning district in
4 the municipality, the setbacks, lot frontage, and lot width shall be reduced by the same proportion
5 that the area of such substandard lot meets the minimum lot area of the district in which the lot is
6 located. By way of example, if the lot area of a substandard lot only meets forty percent (40%) of
7 the minimum lot area required in the district in which it is located, the setbacks, lot frontage, and
8 lot width shall each be reduced to forty percent (40%) of the requirements for those dimensional
9 standards in the same district.
10 (2) Maximum lot building coverage for lots that are nonconforming in area shall be
11 increased by the inverse proportion that the area of such substandard lot meets the minimum area
12 requirements in the district in which the lot is located. By way of example, if the lot area of a
13 substandard lot only meets forty percent (40%) of the required minimum lot area, the maximum lot
14 building coverage is allowed to increase by sixty percent (60%) over the maximum permitted lot
15 building coverage in that district.
16 All proposals exceeding such reduced requirement shall proceed with a modification
17 request under § 45-24-46 or a dimensional variance request under § 45-24-41, whichever is
18 applicable.
19 (c) Provisions Except as set forth otherwise in this chapter and in chapter 23 of title 45,
20 provisions may be made for the merger of contiguous unimproved, or improved and unimproved,
21 substandard lots of record in the same ownership to create dimensionally conforming lots or to
22 reduce the extent of dimensional nonconformance. The ordinance shall specify the standards, on a
23 district by district basis, which determine the mergers. The standards shall include, but are not to
24 be limited to, the availability of infrastructure, the character of the neighborhood, and the
25 consistency with the comprehensive plan. The merger of lots shall not be required when the
26 substandard lot of record has an area equal to or greater than the area of fifty percent (50%) of the
27 lots within two hundred feet (200′) of the subject lot, as confirmed by the zoning enforcement
28 officer a compilation plan signed by a professional land surveyor as such term is defined by the
29 rules and regulations for professional land surveying.
30 45-24-46. Special provisions — Modification.
31 (a) A zoning ordinance shall provide for the issuance of modifications from the literal
32 dimensional requirements of the zoning ordinance in the instance of the construction, alteration, or
33 structural modification of a structure or lot of record. The zoning enforcement officer is authorized
34 to grant modification permits. The zoning ordinance shall permit modifications that are fifteen
LC002868 - Page 17 of 21
1 percent (15%) or less of the dimensional requirements specified in the zoning ordinance but may
2 permit modification up to twenty-five percent (25%). A modification does not permit moving of
3 lot lines. Within ten (10) days of the receipt of a request for a modification, the zoning enforcement
4 officer shall make a decision as to the suitability of the requested modification based on the
5 following determinations:
6 (1) The modification requested is reasonably necessary for the full enjoyment of the
7 permitted use;
8 (2) If the modification is granted, neighboring property will neither be substantially injured
9 nor its appropriate use substantially impaired;
10 (3) The modification requested does not require a variance of a flood hazard requirement,
11 unless the building is built in accordance with applicable regulations; and
12 (4) The modification requested does not violate any rules or regulations with respect to
13 freshwater or coastal wetlands.
14 (b) Upon an affirmative determination, in the case of a modification of five percent (5%)
15 or less, the zoning enforcement officer shall have the authority to issue a permit approving the
16 modification, without any public notice requirements. In the case of a modification of greater than
17 five percent (5%), the zoning enforcement officer shall notify, by first class mail, all property
18 owners abutting the property which is the subject of the modification request, and shall indicate the
19 street address of the subject property in the notice, and shall publish in a newspaper of local
20 circulation within the city or town that the modification will be granted unless written objection is
21 received within fourteen (14) days of the public notice. If written objection is received within
22 fourteen (14) days, the request for a modification shall be scheduled for the next available hearing
23 before the zoning board of review on application for a dimensional variance following the standard
24 procedures for such variances, including notice requirements provided for under this chapter. If no
25 written objections are received within fourteen (14) days, the zoning enforcement officer shall grant
26 the modification. The zoning enforcement officer may apply any special conditions to the permit
27 as may, in the opinion of the officer, be required to conform to the intent and purposes of the zoning
28 ordinance. The zoning enforcement officer shall keep public records of all requests for
29 modifications, and of findings, determinations, special conditions, and any objections received.
30 Costs of any notice required under this subsection shall be borne by the applicant requesting the
31 modification.
32 (c) Neighborhood character-based modifications (“NCBM”). The zoning enforcement
33 officer is authorized to grant NCBM on any parcel with a public water and sewer connection, and
34 for purposes of residential use, from the literal dimensional requirements of the zoning ordinance
LC002868 - Page 18 of 21
1 in the instance of the construction, alteration, creation or structural modification of a dwelling unit,
2 provided that:
3 (1) Such modifications shall only be granted for dimensional relief from frontage, lot width,
4 and lot depth, up to the average dimensions of the comparable existing built environment;
5 (2) The average dimensions of the comparable existing built environment shall be
6 calculated as follows:
7 (i) Comparable existing parcels shall mean all parcels that are:
8 (A) Within two hundred feet (200') of the subject property; and
9 (B) In the same base zone; and
10 (C) Used for residential purposes.
11 (ii) The average dimensions shall be confirmed by a professional land surveyor.
12 (iii) The average dimensions are to be determined without any additional review of zoning
13 or building code analysis of the legality of the existing dimensions of the comparable existing
14 parcels.
15 (3) Within ten (10) days of the receipt of a request for NCBM, the zoning enforcement
16 officer shall make a decision as to the suitability of the requested modification based on the
17 following determinations:
18 (i) The modification requested does not require a variance of a flood hazard requirement,
19 unless the building is built in accordance with applicable regulations; and
20 (ii) The modification requested does not violate any rules or regulations with respect to
21 freshwater or coastal wetlands; and
22 (iii) The NCBM does not violate any provisions regarding separation included in the state
23 building or fire code;
24 (4) Upon an affirmative determination, in the case of an NCBM modification of equal to
25 or less than thirty percent (30%) of the requirements of the zoning district, the zoning enforcement
26 officer shall have the authority to issue a permit approving the modification, without any public
27 notice requirements. In the case of an NCBM modification of greater than thirty percent (30%), the
28 zoning enforcement officer shall notify, by first class mail, all property owners abutting the
29 property which is the subject of the NCBM modification request, and shall indicate the street
30 address of the subject property in the notice, and shall publish in a newspaper of local circulation
31 within the city or town that the modification will be granted unless written objection is received
32 within fourteen (14) days of the public notice. If written objection is received from any party
33 entitled to notice under this section within fourteen (14) days, the request for a modification shall
34 be scheduled for the next available hearing before the zoning board of review on application for a
LC002868 - Page 19 of 21
1 dimensional variance following the standard procedures for such variances, including notice
2 requirements provided for under this chapter. If no written objections are received within fourteen
3 (14) days, the zoning enforcement officer shall grant the modification. The zoning enforcement
4 officer may apply any special conditions to the permit as may, in the opinion of the officer, be
5 required to conform to the intent and purposes of the zoning ordinance. The zoning enforcement
6 officer shall keep public records of all requests for modifications, and of findings, determinations,
7 special conditions, and any objections received. Costs of any notice required under this subsection
8 shall be borne by the applicant requesting the modification.
9 SECTION 3. This act shall take effect on January 1, 2026.

22 than are permitted by the use regulations of a zoning ordinance is nonconformity by use; or
23 (ii) Nonconforming by dimension: a building, structure, or parcel of land not in compliance
24 with the dimensional regulations of the zoning ordinance. Dimensional regulations include all
25 regulations of the zoning ordinance, other than those pertaining to the permitted uses. A building

30 establishment or maintenance of a use of land, that is prohibited by a zoning ordinance. There are
31 only two (2) categories of variance, a use variance or a dimensional variance.
32 (i) Use variance. Permission to depart from the use requirements of a zoning ordinance
33 where the applicant for the requested variance has shown by evidence upon the record that the
34 subject land or structure cannot yield any beneficial use if it is to conform to the provisions of the
LC002868 - Page 15 of 21

1 zoning ordinance.
2 (ii) Dimensional variance. Permission to depart from the dimensional requirements of a

18 of the city or town as defined in chapter 22.2 of this title; that includes a zoning map; and that
19 complies with the provisions of this chapter.
20 (75) Zoning use district. The basic unit in zoning, either mapped or unmapped, to which a
21 uniform set of regulations applies, or a uniform set of regulations for a specified use. Zoning use
22 districts include, but are not limited to: agricultural, commercial, industrial, institutional, open
23 space, and residential. Each district may include sub-districts. Districts may be combined.
24 45-24-38. General provisions — Substandard lots of record.
25 (a) Any city or town adopting or amending a zoning ordinance under this chapter shall
26 regulate the development of any single substandard lot of record or contiguous lots of record at the
27 effective date of adoption or amendment of the zoning ordinance.
28 (b) Notwithstanding the failure of that lot or those lots to meet the dimensional and/or
29 quantitative requirements, and/or road frontage or other access requirements, applicable in the
30 district as stated in the ordinance, a substandard lot of record shall not be required to seek any
31 zoning relief based solely on the failure to meet minimum lot size requirements of the district in
32 which such lot is located. For any structure proposed under this section on a substandard lot of
33 record, the following dimensional regulations shall apply:
34 (1) Minimum building setbacks, lot frontage, and lot width requirements for a lot that is
LC002868 - Page 16 of 21

1 nonconforming in area shall be reduced by applying the building setback, lot frontage, and lot width
2 requirements from another zoning district in the municipality in which the subject lot would be
3 conforming as to lot area. If the subject lot is not conforming as to lot area in any zoning district in
4 the municipality, the setbacks, lot frontage, and lot width shall be reduced by the same proportion
5 that the area of such substandard lot meets the minimum lot area of the district in which the lot is
6 located. By way of example, if the lot area of a substandard lot only meets forty percent (40%) of
7 the minimum lot area required in the district in which it is located, the setbacks, lot frontage, and
8 lot width shall each be reduced to forty percent (40%) of the requirements for those dimensional
9 standards in the same district.
10 (2) Maximum lot building coverage for lots that are nonconforming in area shall be
11 increased by the inverse proportion that the area of such substandard lot meets the minimum area
12 requirements in the district in which the lot is located. By way of example, if the lot area of a
13 substandard lot only meets forty percent (40%) of the required minimum lot area, the maximum lot
14 building coverage is allowed to increase by sixty percent (60%) over the maximum permitted lot
15 building coverage in that district.
16 All proposals exceeding such reduced requirement shall proceed with a modification
17 request under § 45-24-46 or a dimensional variance request under § 45-24-41, whichever is
18 applicable.
19 (c) Provisions Except as set forth otherwise in this chapter and in chapter 23 of title 45,
20 provisions may be made for the merger of contiguous unimproved, or improved and unimproved,
21 substandard lots of record in the same ownership to create dimensionally conforming lots or to
22 reduce the extent of dimensional nonconformance. The ordinance shall specify the standards, on a
23 district by district basis, which determine the mergers. The standards shall include, but are not to
24 be limited to, the availability of infrastructure, the character of the neighborhood, and the
25 consistency with the comprehensive plan. The merger of lots shall not be required when the
26 substandard lot of record has an area equal to or greater than the area of fifty percent (50%) of the
27 lots within two hundred feet (200′) of the subject lot, as confirmed by the zoning enforcement
28 officer a compilation plan signed by a professional land surveyor as such term is defined by the
29 rules and regulations for professional land surveying.
30 45-24-46. Special provisions — Modification.
31 (a) A zoning ordinance shall provide for the issuance of modifications from the literal
32 dimensional requirements of the zoning ordinance in the instance of the construction, alteration, or
33 structural modification of a structure or lot of record. The zoning enforcement officer is authorized
34 to grant modification permits. The zoning ordinance shall permit modifications that are fifteen
LC002868 - Page 17 of 21

1 percent (15%) or less of the dimensional requirements specified in the zoning ordinance but may
2 permit modification up to twenty-five percent (25%). A modification does not permit moving of
3 lot lines. Within ten (10) days of the receipt of a request for a modification, the zoning enforcement
4 officer shall make a decision as to the suitability of the requested modification based on the
5 following determinations:
6 (1) The modification requested is reasonably necessary for the full enjoyment of the
7 permitted use;
8 (2) If the modification is granted, neighboring property will neither be substantially injured
9 nor its appropriate use substantially impaired;
10 (3) The modification requested does not require a variance of a flood hazard requirement,
11 unless the building is built in accordance with applicable regulations; and
12 (4) The modification requested does not violate any rules or regulations with respect to
13 freshwater or coastal wetlands.
14 (b) Upon an affirmative determination, in the case of a modification of five percent (5%)
15 or less, the zoning enforcement officer shall have the authority to issue a permit approving the
16 modification, without any public notice requirements. In the case of a modification of greater than
17 five percent (5%), the zoning enforcement officer shall notify, by first class mail, all property
18 owners abutting the property which is the subject of the modification request, and shall indicate the
19 street address of the subject property in the notice, and shall publish in a newspaper of local
20 circulation within the city or town that the modification will be granted unless written objection is
21 received within fourteen (14) days of the public notice. If written objection is received within
22 fourteen (14) days, the request for a modification shall be scheduled for the next available hearing
23 before the zoning board of review on application for a dimensional variance following the standard
24 procedures for such variances, including notice requirements provided for under this chapter. If no
25 written objections are received within fourteen (14) days, the zoning enforcement officer shall grant
26 the modification. The zoning enforcement officer may apply any special conditions to the permit
27 as may, in the opinion of the officer, be required to conform to the intent and purposes of the zoning
28 ordinance. The zoning enforcement officer shall keep public records of all requests for
29 modifications, and of findings, determinations, special conditions, and any objections received.
30 Costs of any notice required under this subsection shall be borne by the applicant requesting the
31 modification.
32 (c) Neighborhood character-based modifications (“NCBM”). The zoning enforcement
33 officer is authorized to grant NCBM on any parcel with a public water and sewer connection, and
34 for purposes of residential use, from the literal dimensional requirements of the zoning ordinance
LC002868 - Page 18 of 21

1 in the instance of the construction, alteration, creation or structural modification of a dwelling unit,
2 provided that:
3 (1) Such modifications shall only be granted for dimensional relief from frontage, lot width,
4 and lot depth, up to the average dimensions of the comparable existing built environment;
5 (2) The average dimensions of the comparable existing built environment shall be
6 calculated as follows:
7 (i) Comparable existing parcels shall mean all parcels that are:
8 (A) Within two hundred feet (200') of the subject property; and
9 (B) In the same base zone; and
10 (C) Used for residential purposes.
11 (ii) The average dimensions shall be confirmed by a professional land surveyor.
12 (iii) The average dimensions are to be determined without any additional review of zoning
13 or building code analysis of the legality of the existing dimensions of the comparable existing
14 parcels.
15 (3) Within ten (10) days of the receipt of a request for NCBM, the zoning enforcement
16 officer shall make a decision as to the suitability of the requested modification based on the
17 following determinations:
18 (i) The modification requested does not require a variance of a flood hazard requirement,
19 unless the building is built in accordance with applicable regulations; and
20 (ii) The modification requested does not violate any rules or regulations with respect to
21 freshwater or coastal wetlands; and
22 (iii) The NCBM does not violate any provisions regarding separation included in the state
23 building or fire code;
24 (4) Upon an affirmative determination, in the case of an NCBM modification of equal to
25 or less than thirty percent (30%) of the requirements of the zoning district, the zoning enforcement
26 officer shall have the authority to issue a permit approving the modification, without any public
27 notice requirements. In the case of an NCBM modification of greater than thirty percent (30%), the
28 zoning enforcement officer shall notify, by first class mail, all property owners abutting the
29 property which is the subject of the NCBM modification request, and shall indicate the street
30 address of the subject property in the notice, and shall publish in a newspaper of local circulation
31 within the city or town that the modification will be granted unless written objection is received
32 within fourteen (14) days of the public notice. If written objection is received from any party
33 entitled to notice under this section within fourteen (14) days, the request for a modification shall
34 be scheduled for the next available hearing before the zoning board of review on application for a
LC002868 - Page 19 of 21

1 dimensional variance following the standard procedures for such variances, including notice
2 requirements provided for under this chapter. If no written objections are received within fourteen
3 (14) days, the zoning enforcement officer shall grant the modification. The zoning enforcement
4 officer may apply any special conditions to the permit as may, in the opinion of the officer, be
5 required to conform to the intent and purposes of the zoning ordinance. The zoning enforcement
6 officer shall keep public records of all requests for modifications, and of findings, determinations,
7 special conditions, and any objections received. Costs of any notice required under this subsection
8 shall be borne by the applicant requesting the modification.
9 SECTION 3. This act shall take effect on January 1, 2026.
