12 The general treasurer is hereby authorized and empowered, with the approval of the
13 governor, and in accordance with the provisions of this act to issue capital development bonds in
14 serial form, in the name of and on behalf of the State of Rhode Island, in amounts as may be
15 specified by the governor in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the total amount for the
16 project approved by the people and designated as "capital development loan of 2026 bonds."
17 Provided, however, that the aggregate principal amount of such capital development bonds and of
18 any temporary notes outstanding at any one time issued in anticipation thereof pursuant to section
19 7 hereof shall not exceed the total amount for the project approved by the people. All provisions in
20 this act relating to "bonds" shall also be deemed to apply to "refunding bonds."
21 Capital development bonds issued under this act shall be in denominations of one thousand
22 dollars ($1,000) each, or multiples thereof, and shall be payable in any coin or currency of the
23 United States which at the time of payment shall be legal tender for public and private debts. These

2 SECTION 5. Refunding bonds for 2026 capital development program. –
3 The general treasurer is hereby authorized and empowered, with the approval of the
4 governor, and in accordance with the provisions of this act, to issue bonds to refund the 2026 capital
5 development program bonds, in the name of and on behalf of the state, in amounts as may be
6 specified by the governor in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the total amount approved

14 net the underwriters' cost, and cost of bond insurance, shall, upon their receipt, be paid by the
15 general treasurer immediately to the paying agent for the capital development bonds which are to

21 bonds the proceeds of the refunding bonds, or proceeds from other sources, amounts that, when
22 invested in obligations of the United States or the State of Rhode Island, are sufficient to pay all
23 principal, interest, and premium, if any, on the capital development bonds until these bonds are
24 called for prepayment, then such capital development bonds shall not be considered debts of the
25 State of Rhode Island for any purpose starting from the date of deposit of such monies with the
26 paying agent. The refunding bonds shall continue to be a debt of the state until paid.
27 The term "bond" shall include "note," and the term "refunding bonds" shall include
28 "refunding notes" when used in this act.

31 development bonds issued under this act, exclusive of premiums and accrued interest and net the
32 underwriters' cost, and cost of bond insurance, in one or more of the depositories in which the funds
33 of the state may be lawfully kept in special accounts (hereinafter cumulatively referred to as "such
