3 CHAPTER 1.12
4 CATASTROPHIC ILLNESS IN CHILDREN RELIEF FUND
5 23-1.12-1. Definitions.
6 When used in this chapter, unless the context requires otherwise:
7 (1) "Catastrophic illness" means any illness or condition the medical expenses of which are
8 not covered by any other state or federal program or any insurance contract and exceed ten percent
9 (10%) of the first one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) of annual income of a family plus fifteen
10 percent (15%) of the excess income over one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000).
11 (2) "Child" means a person twenty-one (21) years of age and younger.
12 (3) "Commission" means the catastrophic illness in children relief fund commission
13 established pursuant to § 23-1.12-3.
14 (4) "Family" means a child and the child's parent, parents or legal guardian, as the case
15 may be, who is legally responsible for the child's medical expenses.
16 (5) "Fund" means the catastrophic illness in children relief fund established pursuant to §
17 23-1.12-2.

2 (7) "Resident" means a person legally domiciled within the state for a period of three (3)
