9 (10%) of the first one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) of annual income of a family plus fifteen
10 percent (15%) of the excess income over one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000).
11 (2) "Child" means a person twenty-one (21) years of age and younger.
12 (3) "Commission" means the catastrophic illness in children relief fund commission
13 established pursuant to ยง 23-1.12-3.
