LC001203 - Page 5 of 16
1 applicable constitutional standards for the issuance of administrative search warrants. The
2 administrative standard of probable cause, not the criminal standard of probable cause, shall apply
3 to applications for administrative search warrants;
4 (I) The need for, or reliance upon, an administrative warrant shall not be construed as
5 requiring the department to forfeit the element of surprise in its inspection efforts;
6 (II) An administrative warrant issued pursuant to this subsection must be executed and
7 returned within ten (10) days of its issuance date unless, upon a showing of need for additional
8 time, the court orders otherwise;

21 location is being inspected;
22 (V) Service of an administrative warrant may be required only to the extent provided for
23 in the terms of the warrant itself, by the issuing court.

26 shall subject the refusing party to sanctions, which in the court’s discretion may result in up to six
27 (6) months imprisonment and/or a monetary fine of up to ten thousand dollars ($10,000) per refusal;
28 (21) To give notice of an alleged violation of law to the person responsible therefor
29 whenever the director determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that there is a
30 violation of any provision of law within his or her jurisdiction or of any rule or regulation adopted
31 pursuant to authority granted to him or her. Nothing in this chapter shall limit the authority of the
32 attorney general to prosecute offenders as required by law;
33 (i) The notice shall provide for a time within which the alleged violation shall be remedied,
34 and shall inform the person to whom it is directed that a written request for a hearing on the alleged

3 personally; or sent by registered or certified mail to the person’s last known address; or if the person
4 is served with notice by any other method of service now or hereafter authorized in a civil action
5 under the laws of this state. If no written request for a hearing is made to the director within twenty
6 (20) days of the service of notice, the notice shall automatically become a compliance order;
7 (ii)(A) Whenever the director determines that there exists a violation of any law, rule, or
8 regulation within the director’s jurisdiction that requires immediate action to protect the
9 environment, the director may, without prior notice of violation or hearing, issue an immediate 30
10 compliance order stating the existence of the violation and the action he or she deems necessary.

15 hearing shall be effective for no longer than forty-five (45) days; provided, however, that for good
16 cause shown, the order may be extended one additional period not exceeding forty-five (45) days;
17 (iii) The director may, at his or her discretion and for the purposes of timely and effective
18 resolution and return to compliance, cite a person for alleged noncompliance through the issuance
19 of an expedited citation in accordance with § 42-17.6-3(c);
20 (iv) If a person upon whom a notice of violation has been served under the provisions of
21 this section or if a person aggrieved by any such notice of violation requests a hearing before the
22 director within twenty (20) days of the service of notice of violation, the director shall set a time
23 place for the hearing, and shall give the person requesting that hearing at least five (5) days’ written
24 notice thereof. After the hearing, the director may make findings of fact and shall sustain, modify,
25 or withdraw the notice of violation. If the director sustains or modifies the notice, that decision
26 shall be deemed a compliance order and shall be served upon the person responsible in any manner
27 provided for the service of the notice in this section;
28 (v) The compliance order shall state a time within which the violation shall be remedied,
29 and the original time specified in the notice of violation shall be extended to the time set in the
30 order;
31 (vi) Whenever a compliance order has become effective, whether automatically where no
32 hearing has been requested, where an immediate compliance order has been issued, or upon
33 decision following a hearing, the director may institute injunction proceedings in the superior court
34 of the state for enforcement of the compliance order and for appropriate temporary relief, and in
LC001203 - Page 7 of 16
1 that proceeding, the correctness of a compliance order shall be presumed and the person attacking
2 the order shall bear the burden of proving error in the compliance order, except that the director
3 shall bear the burden of proving in the proceeding the correctness of an immediate compliance
4 order. The remedy provided for in this section shall be cumulative and not exclusive and shall be
5 in addition to remedies relating to the removal or abatement of nuisances or any other remedies
6 provided by law;
7 (vii) Any party aggrieved by a final judgment of the superior court may, within thirty (30)
8 days from the date of entry of such judgment, petition the supreme court for a writ of certiorari to

21 location is being inspected;
22 (V) Service of an administrative warrant may be required only to the extent provided for
23 in the terms of the warrant itself, by the issuing court.

27 (6) months imprisonment and/or a monetary fine of up to ten thousand dollars ($10,000) per refusal;
28 (21) To give notice of an alleged violation of law to the person responsible therefor
29 whenever the director determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that there is a
30 violation of any provision of law within his or her jurisdiction or of any rule or regulation adopted
31 pursuant to authority granted to him or her. Nothing in this chapter shall limit the authority of the
32 attorney general to prosecute offenders as required by law;
33 (i) The notice shall provide for a time within which the alleged violation shall be remedied,
34 and shall inform the person to whom it is directed that a written request for a hearing on the alleged
LC001203 - Page 6 of 16

1 violation may be filed with the director within twenty (20) days after service of the notice. The
2 notice will be deemed properly served upon a person if a copy thereof is served the person
3 personally; or sent by registered or certified mail to the person’s last known address; or if the person
4 is served with notice by any other method of service now or hereafter authorized in a civil action
5 under the laws of this state. If no written request for a hearing is made to the director within twenty
6 (20) days of the service of notice, the notice shall automatically become a compliance order;
7 (ii)(A) Whenever the director determines that there exists a violation of any law, rule, or
8 regulation within the director’s jurisdiction that requires immediate action to protect the
9 environment, the director may, without prior notice of violation or hearing, issue an immediate 30
10 compliance order stating the existence of the violation and the action he or she deems necessary.
11 The compliance order shall become effective immediately upon service or within such time as is
12 specified by the director in such order. No request for a hearing on an immediate-compliance order
13 may be made;
14 (B) Any immediate-compliance order issued under this section without notice and prior
15 hearing shall be effective for no longer than forty-five (45) days; provided, however, that for good

17 (iii) The director may, at his or her discretion and for the purposes of timely and effective
18 resolution and return to compliance, cite a person for alleged noncompliance through the issuance
19 of an expedited citation in accordance with § 42-17.6-3(c);
20 (iv) If a person upon whom a notice of violation has been served under the provisions of
21 this section or if a person aggrieved by any such notice of violation requests a hearing before the
22 director within twenty (20) days of the service of notice of violation, the director shall set a time
23 place for the hearing, and shall give the person requesting that hearing at least five (5) days’ written
24 notice thereof. After the hearing, the director may make findings of fact and shall sustain, modify,
25 or withdraw the notice of violation. If the director sustains or modifies the notice, that decision
26 shall be deemed a compliance order and shall be served upon the person responsible in any manner
27 provided for the service of the notice in this section;
28 (v) The compliance order shall state a time within which the violation shall be remedied,
29 and the original time specified in the notice of violation shall be extended to the time set in the
30 order;
31 (vi) Whenever a compliance order has become effective, whether automatically where no
32 hearing has been requested, where an immediate compliance order has been issued, or upon
33 decision following a hearing, the director may institute injunction proceedings in the superior court
34 of the state for enforcement of the compliance order and for appropriate temporary relief, and in
LC001203 - Page 7 of 16

1 that proceeding, the correctness of a compliance order shall be presumed and the person attacking
2 the order shall bear the burden of proving error in the compliance order, except that the director
3 shall bear the burden of proving in the proceeding the correctness of an immediate compliance
4 order. The remedy provided for in this section shall be cumulative and not exclusive and shall be
5 in addition to remedies relating to the removal or abatement of nuisances or any other remedies
6 provided by law;
7 (vii) Any party aggrieved by a final judgment of the superior court may, within thirty (30)
8 days from the date of entry of such judgment, petition the supreme court for a writ of certiorari to
9 review any questions of law. The petition shall set forth the errors claimed. Upon the filing of the
10 petition with the clerk of the supreme court, the supreme court may, if it sees fit, issue its writ of
11 certiorari;

25 and consistent protection, management, continuity of ownership and purpose, and centralized
26 records-keeping for lands, water, and open spaces owned in fee or controlled in full or in part
27 through other interests, rights, or devices such as conservation easements or restrictions, by private
28 and public land trusts in Rhode Island. The director may charge a reasonable fee for filing of each
29 document submitted by a land trust;
30 (ii) The term “public land trust” means any public instrumentality created by a Rhode
31 Island municipality for the purposes stated herein and financed by means of public funds collected

1 conservancy. The main purpose of either a public or a private land trust shall be the protection,
2 acquisition, or control of land, water, wildlife, wildlife habitat, plants, and/or other natural features,
3 areas, or open space for the purpose of managing or maintaining, or causing to be managed or
4 maintained by others, the land, water, and other natural amenities in any undeveloped and relatively
5 natural state in perpetuity. A private land trust must be granted exemption from federal income tax
6 under Internal Revenue Code 501(c)(3) [26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(3)] within two (2) years of its
7 incorporation in Rhode Island or it may not continue to function as a land trust in Rhode Island. A
8 private land trust may not be incorporated for the exclusive purpose of acquiring or accepting
9 property or rights in property from a single individual, family, corporation, business, partnership,
10 or other entity. Membership in any private land trust must be open to any individual subscribing to
11 the purposes of the land trust and agreeing to abide by its rules and regulations including payment
12 of reasonable dues;

16 dissolution of the land trust;
17 (B) All land trusts, public and private, will record in the public records, of the appropriate
18 towns and cities in Rhode Island, all deeds, conservation easements, or restrictions or other interests
19 and rights acquired in land and will also file copies of all such documents and current copies of
20 their articles of association, their bylaws, and their annual reports with the secretary of state and
21 with the director of the Rhode Island department of environmental management. The director is
22 hereby directed to establish and maintain permanently a system for keeping records of all private
23 and public land trust land holdings in Rhode Island;
24 (29) The director will contact in writing, not less often than once every two (2) years, each
25 public or private land trust to ascertain: that all lands held by the land trust are recorded with the
26 director; the current status and condition of each land holding; that any funds or other assets of the
27 land trust held as endowment for specific lands have been properly audited at least once within the
28 two-year (2) period; the name of the successor organization named in the public or private land
29 trust’s bylaws or articles of association; and any other information the director deems essential to
30 the proper and continuous protection and management of land and interests or rights in land held

4 of original acquisition by the trust. Any trust assets or interests other than land or rights in land
5 accruing to the state under such circumstances will be held and managed as a separate fund for the
6 benefit of the designated trust lands;

22 requirements of the order or notice, the director shall provide written notice of the same, which
23 notice shall be eligible for recordation. The original, written notice shall be forwarded to the city
24 or town wherein the subject facility is located, and the notice of satisfactory completion shall be
25 recorded in the general index by the appropriate municipal official in the land-evidence records in
