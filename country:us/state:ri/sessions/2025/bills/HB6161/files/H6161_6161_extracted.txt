1 (B) The fact that the employer provides, or would be required to provide, a similar

3 job or those with disabilities, shall create a rebuttable presumption that the accommodation does
4 not impose an undue hardship on the employer.
5 (c) No employer shall be required by this section to create additional employment that the
6 employer would not otherwise have created, unless the employer does so, or would do so, for other

10 more seniority; or promote any employee who is not qualified to perform the job, unless the

12 as those who are injured on the job or those with disabilities.
13 (e) The provisions of this section shall not be construed to affect any other provision of law

15 otherwise affect any other law that provides greater protection or specific benefits with respect to
16 pregnancy, childbirth, menopause, or medical conditions related to childbirth or menopause.
