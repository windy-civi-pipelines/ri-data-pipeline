6 question;
7 (3) The state has a compelling interest in ensuring equitable access to public educational
8 opportunities and extracurricular programs supported by public resources;
9 (4) The current structure of athletic governance creates unequal access, disproportionately
10 affecting students enrolled in small or non-traditional schools, particularly female students;
11 (5) This act shall be known and may be cited as “The Vera Riley Act,” in recognition of a
12 Rhode Island student whose exclusion from school-based athletics highlighted this systemic issue.

3 sport at the public middle school in the school district where the student resides; provided that:
4 (1) The student meets all applicable academic and conduct eligibility requirements;
5 (2) The student’s non-sponsoring school verifies, in writing, that the sport is not offered;
6 and
7 (3) The public school principal approves the participation for administrative coordination

10 the sole basis of their enrollment at a non-sponsoring middle school; provided that, the conditions
11 of subsection (a) of this section are satisfied.
12 (c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a public school to create, expand,
13 or alter its interscholastic athletic programs or team structures, but public schools are encouraged
14 to provide reasonable access to eligible students pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.
15 16-117-2. Rulemaking authority.
16 The department of education, in consultation with the Rhode Island interscholastic league
