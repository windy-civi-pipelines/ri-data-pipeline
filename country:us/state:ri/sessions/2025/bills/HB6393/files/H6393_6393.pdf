4 personal property, but in no case for more than seven (7) days from the date of the resident's death.
5 If the personal property is not removed within seven (7) days the assisted living residence may
6 arrange for the storage of the personal property.
7 (C) A violation of the provisions of subsection (a)(2)(xix)(B) shall constitute a deceptive
8 trade practice in violation of chapter 13.1 of title 6.

30 (b) For purposes of subdivisions (a)(2)(ii), (iv), (xi), (xiii), (xiv), (xvii), (xviii)(A) and
31 (xxviii), the term “resident” also means the resident’s agent as designated in writing or legal
