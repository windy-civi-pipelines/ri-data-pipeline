RELATING TO PROPERTY -- RESIDENTIAL LANDLORD AND TENANT ACT
Introduced By: Representatives Casey, Costantino, Chippendale, Finkelman, J. Brien,
Phillips, Baginski, Lima, Noret, and Corvese
Date Introduced: February 28, 2025
Referred To: House Judiciary
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Section 34-18-46 of the General Laws in Chapter 34-18 entitled "Residential
2 Landlord and Tenant Act" is hereby amended to read as follows:
3 34-18-46. Retaliatory conduct prohibited.
4 (a) Except as provided in this section, a landlord may not retaliate by increasing rent or
5 decreasing services or by bringing or threatening to bring an action for possession because:
6 (1) The tenant has complained to a governmental agency charged with responsibility for
7 enforcement of a building or housing code of a violation applicable to the premises materially
8 affecting health and safety; or
9 (2) The tenant has complained to the landlord of a violation under § 34-18-22; or
10 (3) The tenant has organized or become a member of a tenants’ union or similar
11 organization; or
12 (4) The tenant has availed himself or herself of any other lawful rights and remedies.
13 (b) If the landlord acts in violation of subsection (a), the tenant is entitled to the remedies
14 provided in § 34-18-34 and has a defense in any retaliatory action against him or her for possession.
15 In an action by or against the tenant, evidence of a complaint within six (6) months before the
16 alleged act of retaliation creates a presumption that the landlord’s conduct was in retaliation. The
17 presumption does not arise if the tenant made the complaint after notice of a proposed rental
18 increase or diminution of services. “Presumption” means that the trier of fact must find the
19 existence of the fact presumed unless and until evidence is introduced which would support a

1 finding of its nonexistence.
2 (c) Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b), this subsection shall not be considered
3 retaliatory, and a landlord may bring an action for possession if:
4 (1) The violation of the applicable building or housing code was caused primarily by lack
5 of reasonable care by the tenant, a member of his or her family, or other person on the premises
6 with his or her consent; or
7 (2) The tenant is in default in rent; or
8 (3) Compliance with the applicable lead mitigation act, building or housing code or other
9 public action such as eminent domain, requires alteration, remodeling, or demolition which would
10 effectively deprive the tenant of use of the dwelling unit, and the relocation requirements have been
11 met by the municipality.
12 (d) The maintenance of an action under subsection (c) of this section does not release the
13 landlord from liability under § 34-18-28(b).
14 SECTION 2. Section 34-18-58 of the General Laws in Chapter 34-18 entitled "Residential
15 Landlord and Tenant Act" is hereby amended to read as follows:
16 34-18-58. Statewide mandatory rental registry.
17 (a) All landlords who lease a residential property constructed prior to 1978 and that is not
18 exempt from the requirements of chapter 128.1 of title 42 (“lead hazard mitigation”) shall register
19 the following information with the department of health:
20 (1) Names of individual landlords or any the business entity or property management
21 company responsible for leasing to a tenant under this chapter;
22 (2) An active business address, PO box, or home address;
23 (3) An active email address;
24 (4) An active telephone number that would reasonably facilitate communications with the
25 tenant of each dwelling unit; and
26 (5) Any property manager, management company, or agent for service of the property,
27 along with the business address, PO box, or home address of the property manager, management
28 company, or agent and including:
29 (i) An active email address; and
30 (ii) An active telephone number, for each such person or legal entity, if applicable, for each
31 dwelling unit; and
32 (6) Information necessary to identify each dwelling unit.
33 (b) All landlords who lease a residential property constructed prior to 1978 and that is not
34 exempt from the requirements of chapter 128.1 of title 42 (“lead hazard mitigation”) shall, in

4 demonstrate that they are exempt from the requirement to obtain a certificate of conformance.
5 (c) Contingent upon available funding, the department of health, or designee, shall create
6 a publicly accessible an online database containing the information obtained in accordance with
7 subsections (a) and (b) of this section, no later than nine (9) months following the effective date of
