12 bases or outlets of out-of-state manufacturers; and fabricating processes incidental to warehousing
13 or distribution of raw materials, such as alteration of stock for the convenience of a customer; are
14 excluded from this definition;
15 (ii) For the purposes of this section and §§ 44-4-10 and 44-5-38, the term “manufacturer’s
16 inventory,” or any similar term, means and includes the manufacturer’s raw materials, the
17 manufacturer’s work in process, and finished products manufactured by the manufacturer in this

20 store or other similar selling place operated by the manufacturer whether or not the retail
21 establishment is located in the same building in which the manufacturer operates the manufacturing
22 plant;
23 (iii) For the purpose of § 44-11-2, a “manufacturer” is a person whose principal business
24 in this state consists of transforming raw materials into a finished product for trade through any or
25 all of the operations described in paragraph (i) of this subdivision. A person will be deemed to be
26 principally engaged if the gross receipts that person derived from the manufacturing operations in

28 fifty percent (50%) of the total gross receipts that person derived from all the business activities in

30 percentage, gross receipts derived by a manufacturer from the sale, lease, or rental of finished
31 products manufactured by the manufacturer in this state, even though the manufacturer’s store or
32 other selling place may be at a different location from the location of the manufacturer’s
33 manufacturing plant in this state, are deemed to have been derived from manufacturing;

LC002767 - Page 4 of 31

1 “manufacturer” also includes persons who are principally engaged in any of the general activities
2 coded and listed as establishments engaged in manufacturing in the Standard Industrial
3 Classification Manual prepared by the Technical Committee on Industrial Classification, Office of
4 Statistical Standards, Executive Office of the President, United States Bureau of the Budget, as
5 revised from time to time, but eliminating as manufacturers those persons, who, because of their
6 limited type of manufacturing activities, are classified in the manual as falling within the trade
7 rather than an industrial classification of manufacturers. Among those thus eliminated, and
8 accordingly also excluded as manufacturers within the meaning of this paragraph, are persons
9 primarily engaged in selling, to the general public, products produced on the premises from which
10 they are sold, such as neighborhood bakeries, candy stores, ice cream parlors, shade shops, and
11 custom tailors, except, that a person who manufactures bakery products for sale primarily for home

21 reconstructed, erected, installed, or acquired in furtherance of federal or state requirements or
22 standards for the control of water or air pollution or contamination, and certified as approved in an
23 order entered by the director of environmental management. The property is exempt as long as it is
24 operated properly in compliance with the order of approval of the director of environmental
25 management; provided, that any grant of the exemption by the director of environmental
26 management in excess of ten (10) years is approved by the city or town in which the property is

30 placed in operation for the first time after April 13, 1970;
31 (22) Manufacturing machinery and equipment acquired or used by a manufacturer after

7 equipment is used for the manufacturing processes, research and development, or quality assurance.
8 In the instances where machinery and equipment is used in both manufacturing and/or research and
9 development and/or quality assurance activities and non-manufacturing activities, the assessment
10 on machinery and equipment is prorated by applying the percentage of usage of the equipment for
11 the manufacturing, research and development, and quality-assurance activity to the value of the
12 machinery and equipment for purposes of taxation, and the portion of the value used for
13 manufacturing, research and development, and quality assurance is exempt from taxation. The
14 burden of demonstrating this percentage usage of machinery and equipment for manufacturing and
15 for research and development and/or quality assurance of its manufactured products rests with the
16 manufacturer; and
17 (iii) Machinery and equipment described in §§ 44-18-30(7) and 44-18-30(22) that was
18 purchased after July 1, 1997; provided that the city or town council of the city or town in which the

20 from taxation. For purposes of this subsection, city councils and town councils of any municipality
21 may, by ordinance, wholly or partially exempt from taxation the machinery and equipment
22 discussed in this subsection for the period of time established in the ordinance and may, by
23 ordinance, establish the procedures for taxpayers to avail themselves of the benefit of any
24 exemption permitted under this section; provided, that the ordinance does not apply to any
25 machinery or equipment of a business, subsidiary, or any affiliated business that locates or relocates
26 from a city or town in this state to another city or town in the state;
27 (23) Precious metal bullion, meaning any elementary metal that has been put through a
28 process of melting or refining, and that is in a state or condition that its value depends upon its
29 content and not its form. The term does not include fabricated precious metal that has been
30 processed or manufactured for some one or more specific and customary industrial, professional,
31 or artistic uses;
32 (24) Hydroelectric power-generation equipment, which includes, but is not limited to,

2 acquired or used by a person or corporation who or that owns or leases a dam and utilizes the
3 equipment to generate hydroelectric power;

14 are generated primarily by the same taxpayer and where the personal property is located at, in, or
15 adjacent to a generating facility of the taxpayer. The taxpayer may, but need not, procure an order
16 from the director of the department of environmental management certifying that the tangible
17 personal property has this function, which order effects a conclusive presumption that the tangible
18 personal property qualifies for the exemption under this subdivision. If any information relating to
19 secret processes or methods of manufacture, production, or treatment is disclosed to the department
20 of environmental management only to procure an order, and is a “trade secret” as defined in § 28-
21 21-10(b), it shall not be open to public inspection or publicly disclosed unless disclosure is
