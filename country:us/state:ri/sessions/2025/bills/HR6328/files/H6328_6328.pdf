REAFFIRMING THE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND
TAIWAN WHILE SUPPORTING ENHANCED BILATERAL RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN
AND TAIWAN'S PARTICIPATION IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
Introduced By: Representatives Kennedy, Shekarchi, Blazejewski, Chippendale,
Kazarian, Edwards, Diaz, McNamara, Ackerman, and Abney
Date Introduced: May 13, 2025
Referred To: House read and passed
1 WHEREAS, The United States and the Republic of China (Taiwan) share a robust
2 bilateral relationship marked by a mutually beneficial partnership supported by our common
3 values of freedom, democracy, the rule of law, and a free market economy, that has resulted in
4 our countries enjoying among the strongest and most enduring relations to date; and
5 WHEREAS, We congratulate Taiwan as May 20, 2025 marks the second year of the
6 Honorable Dr. Lai Ching-te as President and Bi-khim Hsiao as Vice President of Taiwan, thereby
7 demonstrating the vibrancy of Taiwan’s democracy; and
8 WHEREAS, The United States ranks as Taiwan's second-largest trading partner, and
9 Taiwan was the seventh-largest trading partner of the United States in 2024, with United States
10 trade in goods with Taiwan totaling an estimated $157.8 billion, a 34.79% increase over 2023,
11 while the United States is the largest supplier of agricultural products to Taiwan, totaling $3.78
12 billion in 2024; and
13 WHEREAS, The Government of Taiwan has expressed a desire to reach an Avoidance of
14 Double Taxation Agreement (ADTA) with the United States, which will certainly increase
15 significantly Rhode Island exports to Taiwan, bilateral investment, and jobs in Rhode Island; and
16 WHEREAS, Regarding Rhode Island-Taiwan trade, in 2024, Rhode Island’s total exports
17 to Taiwan reached $32.4 million, which included computer equipment, metal processing
18 products, basic chemicals, medical equipment, and electrical equipment and components, making
19 Taiwan the 18th-largest export market of Rhode Island in the world and one of largest markets for

1 Rhode Island in Asia. A Rhode Island trade office in Taiwan would further increase bilateral
2 trade exchanges and create more economic benefits for the people of Rhode Island; and
3 WHEREAS, The U.S. government actively encourages engagement between the people
4 of the United States and Taiwan, especially at the state level, in terms of trade, investment,
5 commerce, education, and cultural exchanges, and supports Taiwan’s meaningful participation in
6 international organizations. U.S. policy toward Taiwan is guided by the Taiwan Relations Act
7 (TRA) of 1979 and not United Nations Resolution 2758 (1971) which neither mentions Taiwan
8 nor prevents Taiwan’s international participation; and
9 WHEREAS, Taiwan is a key transport hub in the Asia-Pacific region, making its
10 inclusion in international organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the
11 International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) imperative for the best interests and safety of
12 the international community. In addition, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
13 Change (UNFCCC) is necessary in the global effort to combat climate change; now, therefore be
14 it
15 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
16 encourages the Rhode Island State Government to promote and strengthen bilateral trade relations
17 with Taiwan, including considering the possible opening of a trade office in Taiwan, and supports
18 Taiwan's legitimate right to participate in international organizations and agreements, including
19 the WHO, ICAO, and UNFCCC; and be it further
20 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
21 transmit duly certified copies of this resolution to the Honorable Donald J. Trump, President of
22 the United States; the Rhode Island Delegation to the United States Congress; the Honorable
23 Daniel J. McKee, Governor, State of Rhode Island; the Honorable Dr. Lai Ching-te, President,
24 Republic of China (Taiwan); and Director-General Charles Liao of the Taipei Economic and
25 Cultural Office in Boston.
