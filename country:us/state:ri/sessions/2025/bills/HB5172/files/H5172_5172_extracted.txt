23 (2) The analysis shall include examining the impact of merging the individual and small-
24 employer markets on premiums charged to individuals and small-employer groups.

30 recommendations the commissioner may implement, with supporting rationale. The workgroup
31 shall consider and make recommendations for:
32 (1) Establishing a consistent standard for electronic eligibility and coverage verification.
33 Such standard shall:
34 (i) Include standards for eligibility inquiry and response and, wherever possible, be

1 consistent with the standards adopted by nationally recognized organizations, such as the Centers

3 (ii) Enable providers and payors to exchange eligibility requests and responses on a system-
4 to-system basis or using a payor-supported web browser;

11 and benefits information;
12 (v) Recommend a standard or common process to protect all providers from the costs of
13 services to patients who are ineligible for insurance coverage in circumstances where a payor
14 provides eligibility verification based on best information available to the payor at the date of the
15 request of eligibility.
16 (2) Developing implementation guidelines and promoting adoption of the guidelines for:
17 (i) The use of the National Correct Coding Initiative code-edit policy by payors and

23 (iv) Uniformity in the processing of claims by payors; and the processing of corrections to
24 claims by providers and payors;
25 (v) A standard payor-denial review process for providers when they request a
26 reconsideration of a denial of a claim that results from differences in clinical edits where no single,
27 common-standards body or process exists and multiple conflicting sources are in use by payors and
28 providers.
29 (vi) Nothing in this section, nor in the guidelines developed, shall inhibit an individual
30 payor’s ability to employ, and not disclose to providers, temporary code edits for the purpose of
31 detecting and deterring fraudulent billing activities. The guidelines shall require that each payor
32 disclose to the provider its adjudication decision on a claim that was denied or adjusted based on
33 the application of such edits and that the provider have access to the payor’s review and appeal
34 process to challenge the payor’s adjudication decision.

3 prosecution under applicable law of potentially fraudulent billing activities.
4 (3) Developing and promoting widespread adoption by payors and providers of guidelines
5 to:
6 (i) Ensure payors do not automatically deny claims for services when extenuating

22 authorization requirements, based on stratification of healthcare providers’ performance and
23 adherence to evidence-based medicine with the input of contracted healthcare providers and/or
24 provider organizations. Such criteria shall be transparent and easily accessible to contracted
25 providers. Such selective prior authorization programs shall be available when healthcare providers
26 participate directly with the insurer in risk-based payment contracts and may be available to
27 providers who do not participate in risk-based contracts;
28 (vi) Require the review of medical services, including behavioral health services, and
29 prescription drugs, subject to prior authorization on at least an annual basis, with the input of
30 contracted healthcare providers and/or provider organizations. Any changes to the list of medical
31 services, including behavioral health services, and prescription drugs requiring prior authorization,
32 shall be shared via provider-accessible websites;
33 (vii) Improve communication channels between health plans, healthcare providers, and
34 patients by:

4 websites; and
5 (B) Supporting:
6 (I) Timely submission by healthcare providers of the complete information necessary to
7 make a prior authorization determination, as early in the process as possible; and
8 (II) Timely notification of prior authorization determinations by health plans to impacted
9 health plan enrollees, and healthcare providers, including, but not limited to, ordering providers,
10 and/or rendering providers, and dispensing pharmacists which may be satisfied by posting to
11 provider-accessible websites or similar electronic portals or services;
12 (viii) Increase and strengthen continuity of patient care by:
13 (A) Defining protections for continuity of care during a transition period for patients
14 undergoing an active course of treatment, when there is a formulary or treatment coverage change
15 or change of health plan that may disrupt their current course of treatment and when the treating
16 physician determines that a transition may place the patient at risk; and for prescription medication
17 by allowing a grace period of coverage to allow consideration of referred health plan options or
18 establishment of medical necessity of the current course of treatment;
19 (B) Requiring continuity of care for medical services, including behavioral health services,
20 and prescription medications for patients on appropriate, chronic, stable therapy through
21 minimizing repetitive prior authorization requirements; and which for prescription medication shall
22 be allowed only on an annual review, with exception for labeled limitation, to establish continued
23 benefit of treatment; and
24 (C) Requiring communication between healthcare providers, health plans, and patients to
25 facilitate continuity of care and minimize disruptions in needed treatment which may be satisfied
26 by posting to provider-accessible websites or similar electronic portals or services;
27 (D) Continuity of care for formulary or drug coverage shall distinguish between FDA
28 designated interchangeable products and proprietary or marketed versions of a medication;
29 (ix) Encourage healthcare providers and/or provider organizations and health plans to

6 the quarterly public meetings in accordance with subsection (a). The advisory council shall develop
7 measures to inform small businesses of an insurance complaint process to ensure that small
8 businesses that experience rate increases in a given year may request and receive a formal review
9 by the department. The advisory council shall assess views of the health provider community

11 insurers’ role in promoting efficient and high-quality health care. The advisory council shall issue
12 an annual report of findings and recommendations to the governor and the general assembly and
13 present its findings at hearings before the house and senate finance committees. The advisory
14 council is to be diverse in interests and shall include representatives of community consumer

23 (2) The analysis shall include examining the impact of merging the individual and small-
24 employer markets on premiums charged to individuals and small-employer groups.

30 recommendations the commissioner may implement, with supporting rationale. The workgroup
31 shall consider and make recommendations for:

11 and benefits information;
12 (v) Recommend a standard or common process to protect all providers from the costs of

15 request of eligibility.
16 (2) Developing implementation guidelines and promoting adoption of the guidelines for:
17 (i) The use of the National Correct Coding Initiative code-edit policy by payors and

28 providers.
29 (vi) Nothing in this section, nor in the guidelines developed, shall inhibit an individual
30 payor’s ability to employ, and not disclose to providers, temporary code edits for the purpose of

26 participate directly with the insurer in risk-based payment contracts and may be available to
27 providers who do not participate in risk-based contracts;

29 prescription drugs, subject to prior authorization on at least an annual basis, with the input of

18 establishment of medical necessity of the current course of treatment;
19 (B) Requiring continuity of care for medical services, including behavioral health services,
20 and prescription medications for patients on appropriate, chronic, stable therapy through
