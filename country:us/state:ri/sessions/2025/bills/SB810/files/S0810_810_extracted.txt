IN GENERAL ASSEMBLY
JANUARY SESSION, A.D. 2025
____________
A N A C T
Introduced By: Senator Tiara T. Mack
Date Introduced: March 14, 2025
Referred To: Senate Judiciary
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Whereas, the Rhode Island House of Representatives passed House
2 Resolution 5250, creating a “Special Legislative Study Commission Ensuring Racial Equity and
3 Optimizing Health and Safety Laws Affecting Marginalized Individuals” (hereinafter “the
4 Commission”) in 2021.
5 Whereas, this thirteen-member Commission specifically sought to draw from and expand
6 upon the significant research on the health and safety implications of laws related to violence,
7 exploitation, stigma, human trafficking and sexual health; laws that disproportionately impact
8 women, transgender individuals, and people of color.
9 Whereas, members of the Commission met seven times between November 2021 and April
10 2023 and heard testimony from a variety of experts and individuals with lived experience in the sex
11 trade.
12 Whereas, the Commission issued a comprehensive report on August 14, 2023 with
13 numerous findings. The findings below are relevant to this report:
14 Finding 6. The ACLU has a long-standing position on the issue of sex work
15 decriminalization and, for over 40 years, has opposed laws criminalizing sexual activity among
16 consenting adults. According to the ACLU, these laws have traditionally represented a direct form
17 of discrimination against women.
18 Finding 7. According to the Erotic Labor Alliance of New England, repressive policies
19 including criminalization of sex work has been associated with increased risk of sexual violence,
1 almost two times increased risk of HIV and other STIs, and disruption of support networks and
2 access to services.
3 Finding 8. According to a study done in 2018 by Lucy Platt entitled “Associations between
4 sex work laws and sex workers’ health: A systematic review and meta-analysis of quantitative and
5 qualitative studies”, the removal of criminal and administrative sanctions for sex work is needed to
6 improve sex workers’ health and access to services and justice.
7 Finding 9. The “New Zealand Model” is a 2003 law passed by New Zealand which aims
8 to uphold the human rights of sex workers and decriminalizes prostitution. Under that model, it is
9 not against the law to work as a sex worker or operate a brothel, nor is it against the law to pay for
10 sexual services. However, it is illegal for any third party to facilitate anyone under the age of
11 eighteen (18) into undertaking sex work.
12 Finding 10. According to COYOTE RI: the main impact of the re-criminalization of indoor
13 prostitution has been the repeated arrests and deportations of Asian spa workers; over the last six
14 (6) years, there has been a sharp increase in arrests of Asian spa workers; and, in 2021, Asian spa
15 workers made up thirteen (13) of Rhode Island's sixteen (16) total prostitution-related arrests.
16 Whereas, this final report also called for numerous recommendations. In relevant part, the
17 report issued the following recommendation:
18 Recommendation 1. Consider a Rhode Island law to restore the pre-2009 landscape, such
19 that private, consensual sexual activity remains out of the reach of criminal laws. Alternatively,
20 consider adopting the New Zealand Model (referenced in the above findings), which decriminalizes
21 prostitution.

26 11-34-8.3. Criminal forfeiture procedures.
27 (a) Any criminal complaint charging an offense under §§ 11-34-8.1 or 11-34-8.2 shall set
28 forth with reasonable particularity:
29 (1) Whether the law enforcement agency seeks to have forfeited property pursuant to this
30 section; and
31 (2) What property the law enforcement agency seeks to have forfeited.
32 (b) The court may, upon application of the law enforcement agency, enter a restraining
33 order or injunction, require any person claiming any interest in the subject motor vehicle to execute
34 a satisfactory performance bond to the state, or take any other action to preserve the availability of
LC000837 - Page 7 of 19
1 the motor vehicle subject to forfeiture described in § 11-34-8.2 whether prior to or subsequent to
2 the filing of a complaint. Written notice and an opportunity for a hearing shall be afforded to
3 persons appearing to have an interest in the motor vehicle. The hearing is limited to the issues of
4 whether:
5 (1) There is a substantial probability that the law enforcement agency will prevail on the
6 issue of forfeiture and that failure to enter the order will result in the motor vehicle being destroyed,
7 conveyed, encumbered or further encumbered, removed from the jurisdiction of the court, or
8 otherwise made unavailable for forfeitures; and
9 (2) The need to preserve the availability of property through the entry of the requested
10 order outweighs the hardship on any party against whom the order is to be entered.
11 (c)(1) An order under this section may be entered upon application of the law enforcement
12 agency without notice or opportunity for a hearing when a complaint has not yet been filed with
13 respect to the property if the law enforcement agency demonstrates that there is probable cause to
14 believe that the property with respect to which the order is sought would, in the event of conviction,
15 be subject to forfeiture under § 11-34-8.2 and that provision of notice will jeopardize the availability
16 of the motor vehicle for forfeiture. The order shall expire within ten (10) days of the date on which
17 it is entered unless for good cause shown or unless the party against whom it is entered consents to
18 an extension for a longer period.
19 (2) A hearing requested by any party in interest concerning an order entered under this
20 subsection shall be held at the earliest possible time and prior to the expiration of the temporary
21 order.
22 (3) The court may receive and consider, at the hearing held pursuant to this subsection,
23 evidence and information that would be inadmissible in court.
24 (d) Upon conviction of a person for an offense under § 11-34-8.1, the court may enter a
25 judgment of forfeiture of the property described in §§ 11-34-8.2 and 11-34-8.3 to the city or town
26 and shall also authorize the law enforcement agency to seize the motor vehicle ordered forfeited
27 upon any terms and conditions that the court shall deem proper. Following the entry of an order
28 declaring the property forfeited, the court may, upon application of the law enforcement agency,
29 enter any appropriate orders, require the execution of satisfactory performance bonds, appoint
30 receivers, conservators, appraisers, accountants, or trustees, or take any other action to protect the
31 interest of the law enforcement agency in the motor vehicle ordered forfeited.
32 (e) All right, title, and interest in the motor vehicle described in § 11-34-8.1 vests in the
33 city or town upon the commission of the act giving rise to forfeiture under this section subject to
34 the limitations of § 11-34-8.2. Any such motor vehicle that is subsequently transferred to any person
LC000837 - Page 8 of 19
1 may be the subject of a special verdict of forfeiture and thereafter shall be ordered forfeited to the
2 state, unless the transferee establishes in a hearing that he or she is a bona fide purchaser for value
3 of the motor vehicle who at the time of purchase was reasonably without cause to believe that the
4 motor vehicle was subject for forfeiture.
5 11-34-11. Loitering for indecent purposes in or near schools.
6 Any person who violates this section by attempting to engage a person for the purpose of
7 prostitution or other indecent act, or to patronize or induce or otherwise secure a person to commit
8 any indecent act in the building or on the grounds or within three hundred (300) yards of the grounds
9 of a public or private elementary, vocational, or secondary school, shall be punished by a term of

IN GENERAL ASSEMBLY
JANUARY SESSION, A.D. 2025
____________
A N A C T
RELATING TO CRIMINAL OFFENSES -- COMMERCIAL SEXUAL ACTIVITY
Introduced By: Senator Tiara T. Mack
Date Introduced: March 14, 2025
Referred To: Senate Judiciary
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Whereas, the Rhode Island House of Representatives passed House
2 Resolution 5250, creating a “Special Legislative Study Commission Ensuring Racial Equity and
3 Optimizing Health and Safety Laws Affecting Marginalized Individuals” (hereinafter “the
4 Commission”) in 2021.
5 Whereas, this thirteen-member Commission specifically sought to draw from and expand
6 upon the significant research on the health and safety implications of laws related to violence,
7 exploitation, stigma, human trafficking and sexual health; laws that disproportionately impact
8 women, transgender individuals, and people of color.
9 Whereas, members of the Commission met seven times between November 2021 and April
10 2023 and heard testimony from a variety of experts and individuals with lived experience in the sex
11 trade.
12 Whereas, the Commission issued a comprehensive report on August 14, 2023 with
13 numerous findings. The findings below are relevant to this report:
14 Finding 6. The ACLU has a long-standing position on the issue of sex work
15 decriminalization and, for over 40 years, has opposed laws criminalizing sexual activity among
16 consenting adults. According to the ACLU, these laws have traditionally represented a direct form
17 of discrimination against women.
18 Finding 7. According to the Erotic Labor Alliance of New England, repressive policies
19 including criminalization of sex work has been associated with increased risk of sexual violence,

1 almost two times increased risk of HIV and other STIs, and disruption of support networks and
2 access to services.
3 Finding 8. According to a study done in 2018 by Lucy Platt entitled “Associations between
4 sex work laws and sex workers’ health: A systematic review and meta-analysis of quantitative and
5 qualitative studies”, the removal of criminal and administrative sanctions for sex work is needed to
6 improve sex workers’ health and access to services and justice.
7 Finding 9. The “New Zealand Model” is a 2003 law passed by New Zealand which aims
8 to uphold the human rights of sex workers and decriminalizes prostitution. Under that model, it is
9 not against the law to work as a sex worker or operate a brothel, nor is it against the law to pay for
10 sexual services. However, it is illegal for any third party to facilitate anyone under the age of
11 eighteen (18) into undertaking sex work.
12 Finding 10. According to COYOTE RI: the main impact of the re-criminalization of indoor
13 prostitution has been the repeated arrests and deportations of Asian spa workers; over the last six
14 (6) years, there has been a sharp increase in arrests of Asian spa workers; and, in 2021, Asian spa
15 workers made up thirteen (13) of Rhode Island's sixteen (16) total prostitution-related arrests.
16 Whereas, this final report also called for numerous recommendations. In relevant part, the
17 report issued the following recommendation:
18 Recommendation 1. Consider a Rhode Island law to restore the pre-2009 landscape, such
19 that private, consensual sexual activity remains out of the reach of criminal laws. Alternatively,
20 consider adopting the New Zealand Model (referenced in the above findings), which decriminalizes
21 prostitution.
22 SECTION 2. Sections 11-34.1-1, 11-34.1-2, 11-34.1-3, 11-34.1-4, 11-34.1-6, 11-34.1-7,
23 11-34.1-8, 11-34.1-9, 11-34.1-10, 11-34.1-11, 11-34.1-12, 11-34.1-13 and 11-34.1-14 of the
24 General Laws in Chapter 11-34.1 entitled "Commercial Sexual Activity" are hereby repealed.
25 11-34.1-1. Definitions.
26 The following words and phrases, when used in this chapter, have the following meanings:
27 (1) “Sexual conduct” means sexual intercourse, cunnilingus, fellatio, anal intercourse, and
28 digital intrusion or intrusion by any object into the genital opening or anal opening of another
29 person’s body, or the stimulation by hand of another’s genitals for the purposes of arousing or

32 (b) The court may, upon application of the law enforcement agency, enter a restraining
33 order or injunction, require any person claiming any interest in the subject motor vehicle to execute

LC000837 - Page 7 of 19

1 the motor vehicle subject to forfeiture described in § 11-34-8.2 whether prior to or subsequent to
2 the filing of a complaint. Written notice and an opportunity for a hearing shall be afforded to
3 persons appearing to have an interest in the motor vehicle. The hearing is limited to the issues of
4 whether:
5 (1) There is a substantial probability that the law enforcement agency will prevail on the
6 issue of forfeiture and that failure to enter the order will result in the motor vehicle being destroyed,
7 conveyed, encumbered or further encumbered, removed from the jurisdiction of the court, or
8 otherwise made unavailable for forfeitures; and
9 (2) The need to preserve the availability of property through the entry of the requested
10 order outweighs the hardship on any party against whom the order is to be entered.
11 (c)(1) An order under this section may be entered upon application of the law enforcement
12 agency without notice or opportunity for a hearing when a complaint has not yet been filed with
13 respect to the property if the law enforcement agency demonstrates that there is probable cause to
14 believe that the property with respect to which the order is sought would, in the event of conviction,
15 be subject to forfeiture under § 11-34-8.2 and that provision of notice will jeopardize the availability
16 of the motor vehicle for forfeiture. The order shall expire within ten (10) days of the date on which
17 it is entered unless for good cause shown or unless the party against whom it is entered consents to
18 an extension for a longer period.

20 subsection shall be held at the earliest possible time and prior to the expiration of the temporary

26 and shall also authorize the law enforcement agency to seize the motor vehicle ordered forfeited
27 upon any terms and conditions that the court shall deem proper. Following the entry of an order
28 declaring the property forfeited, the court may, upon application of the law enforcement agency,
29 enter any appropriate orders, require the execution of satisfactory performance bonds, appoint
30 receivers, conservators, appraisers, accountants, or trustees, or take any other action to protect the
31 interest of the law enforcement agency in the motor vehicle ordered forfeited.
32 (e) All right, title, and interest in the motor vehicle described in § 11-34-8.1 vests in the
33 city or town upon the commission of the act giving rise to forfeiture under this section subject to
34 the limitations of § 11-34-8.2. Any such motor vehicle that is subsequently transferred to any person
LC000837 - Page 8 of 19

1 may be the subject of a special verdict of forfeiture and thereafter shall be ordered forfeited to the
2 state, unless the transferee establishes in a hearing that he or she is a bona fide purchaser for value
3 of the motor vehicle who at the time of purchase was reasonably without cause to believe that the
4 motor vehicle was subject for forfeiture.
