12 property in proportion to the benefit received by each property; provided, that the market value or
13 assessed valuation, which benefit shall be determined by and commensurate with the municipal
14 appraisal of each such property shall not be taken into consideration in the calculation of benefit
15 received.
16 (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (b) of this section, any owner of
17 a benefited property or any owner of a burdened property who directly or indirectly damages any
18 portion of the easement or right-of way, including damages caused by such property owners'
1 invitees, shall be solely responsible for repairing or restoring the portion damaged by that owner.

4 writing, to pay the owner’s proportion of the cost of maintaining or repairing or restoring the
5 easement or right-of-way in accordance with subsection (b), an action for specific performance or
6 contribution may be brought in the superior court against the owner by other owners of benefited
7 or burdened properties, either jointly or severally. The written demand shall include information
8 and documentation relevant to the damage repaired or restored, including all engineering or
9 contractor proposals, evaluations, applications and costs, and include a detailed explanation of the
10 factors considered in arriving at the owner’s proportional cost.
