IN GENERAL ASSEMBLY
JANUARY SESSION, A.D. 2025
____________
A N A C T
PROTECTION ACT
Introduced By: Senators Britto, and Bell
Date Introduced: June 02, 2025
Referred To: Senate Environment & Agriculture
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Legislative findings.
2 (1) Current Rhode Island laws do not provide protection for forestland apart from existing
3 wetland protection laws.
4 (2) Rhode Island is the only state in New England that has no state-owned forests protected
5 in their natural state.
6 (3) The world is facing a biodiversity crisis where populations of native species are
7 declining at an alarming rate and many species are facing extinction. Native species in Rhode Island
8 are at risk of becoming regionally extinct due to habitat destruction.
9 (4) Old growth forests are significant ecosystems where native trees, plants, and animals
10 live.
11 (5) There are certain animals, insects, birds, and plants that only live in old growth forests.
12 (6) Old growth forests are important carbon sinks which store more carbon than an average
13 Rhode Island forest, and, if cut, would release its stored carbon into the atmosphere contributing to
14 Climate Change.
15 (7) Old growth forests are extremely rare, and once cut, may not come back for one hundred
16 (100) years or more.
17 (8) According to the 2020 forest action plan prepared jointly by the Rhode Island
18 department of environmental management and the United States forest service, only one percent
1 (1%) of Rhode Island’s forests are over one hundred (100) years old.
2 (9) Clearcutting, and other forms of destructive logging, increases the presence and spread
3 of invasive plants, which can outcompete native plants and harbor ticks.
4 (10) Natural heritage areas on state-owned land have been logged.
5 (11) Clearcutting of forests creates carbon emissions which does not comply with the goals
6 of chapter 6.2 of title 42 ("2021 act on climate").
7 (12) Clearcutting and most other types of logging of natural forests increase the occurrence
8 of destructive brush fire by promoting dry, flammable logging debris, small trees, and underbrush
9 including grassy weeds.
10 (13) Wildfires were at their lowest point when the state was dominated by old growth
11 forests due to old growth forests being more resistant to wildfires. Wildfires increased in the 19th
12 and early 20th centuries after the primeval old growth forests were clear cut.
13 (14) According to the United States Department of the Interior, nationally, almost nine (9)
14 out of ten (10) wildfires are caused by humans.
15 (15) In 2007, the Rhode Island natural heritage program was discontinued.
16 (16) Not one natural area preserve has been designated since the passage of chapter 122 of
17 title 42 ("natural areas protection act of 1993").
18 (17) According to the 2023 report, “Wildlands in New England,” based on research
19 conducted by Harvard Forest, Highstead Foundation, Northeast Wilderness Trust, and Wildlands,
20 Woodlands, Farmlands and Communities, Rhode Island is the only state in New England with no
21 protected Wildlands on public land.
22 (18) The natural area preserves qualify as wildlands.
23 (19) It is a matter of public benefit that old growth forests be untouched and left in their
24 natural state.
25 SECTION 2. Title 2 of the General Laws entitled "AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY"
26 is hereby amended by adding thereto the following chapter:

14 logging operations and prescribed burning operations shall undergo an inventory conducted by the
15 natural heritage program, pursuant to the provisions of chapter 167 of title 42, to determine if the
16 forest meets the criteria to be designated as an old growth forest, natural heritage area, or rare forest
17 ecosystem, as defined in § 2-28-2. The natural heritage program shall be notified of the extractive
18 logging operation and prescribed burning operation no less than three (3) months in advance. All
19 documents pertaining to the extractive logging operation or prescribed burning operation shall be
20 turned over to the natural heritage program at the same time as the initial notice. A report of the
21 inventory prepared by the natural heritage program with the data collected shall be submitted to the

23 or prescribed burning takes place on state-owned land and land owned by the cities and towns of
24 Rhode Island. All extractive logging operations on state-owned land in forests over one acre in size
25 are subject to the approval of the council which upon consultation with the natural heritage program
26 shall determine whether the extractive logging operation involves clearcutting, or any other
27 ecologically destructive logging practice, or creates a fire hazard. No extractive logging operation
28 or prescribed burning operation shall take place until after the natural heritage program’s report
29 and after the council’s approval. There shall be a visual record of all extractive logging operations
30 on state-owned land, as well as felling of hazard trees and invasive trees in old growth forests on
31 state-owned land and land owned by the cities and towns of Rhode Island, and in the natural area
32 preserves, containing images and video of the trees intended to be felled and nearby trees before
33 and after the extractive logging operation and the felling of hazard trees and invasive trees takes
34 place. The visual record shall be the responsibility of the natural heritage program.
LC002978 - Page 5 of 12
1 (b) All extractive logging operations and prescribed burning operations of forests over one

6 published in the county where the property is located and in a newspaper with statewide
7 distribution. No action shall be taken by the state prior to the expiration of sixty (60) days after the
8 notice is published. During the sixty (60) day period, any scheduled extractive logging operation
9 or prescribed burning operation may be appealed by any resident of this state in a suit brought
10 against the department of environmental management in the superior court in the county of
11 Providence. In any action, the court shall vacate the extractive logging operation or prescribed
12 burning operation if it finds the operation violates state or federal law. During the pendency of an
13 appeal the state shall take no action pursuant to the scheduled extractive logging operation or
14 prescribed burning operation.
15 (c) Whenever any land is acquired by the state, or any of its cities and towns, an inventory
16 shall be conducted by the natural heritage program to determine if the forest meets the criteria to
17 be designated as an old growth forest, natural heritage area, or rare forest ecosystem, as defined in
18 § 2-28-2. No extractive logging or prescribed burning shall take place in any acquired land by the
19 state before the natural heritage program completes its inventory.
20 (d) The natural heritage program, established pursuant to the provisions of § 42-167-2,
21 shall conduct an inventory of the forests on state-owned land and land owned by the cities and
22 towns to determine the extent and condition of old growth forest stands, natural heritage areas, and
23 rare forest ecosystems. The preliminary identification of old growth forest stands, natural heritage
24 areas, and rare forest ecosystems shall include an estimate of necessary buffer areas, including an
25 explanation of the rationale for the estimated size and shape of the buffer areas. The maps shall use
26 GIS type mapping software with data of species, land features, soil, water, invasives, and other
27 relevant ecological data in the map files. The maps and data shall be made available to the public
28 on a state website. All old growth forests, natural heritage areas, and rare forest ecosystems on
29 state-owned land identified in this inventory shall be considered for designation as natural area
30 preserves.
31 2-28-6. Preservation and protected funding.
32 Protecting the remaining areas of old growth forests, as defined in § 2-28-2, shall be a
33 priority for the State of Rhode Island and annual application to the general assembly by the division
34 of statewide planning for appropriations to fund the natural heritage program, established pursuant

A N A C T
RELATING TO AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY -- OLD GROWTH FOREST
PROTECTION ACT
Introduced By: Senators Britto, and Bell
Date Introduced: June 02, 2025
Referred To: Senate Environment & Agriculture
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Legislative findings.
2 (1) Current Rhode Island laws do not provide protection for forestland apart from existing
3 wetland protection laws.
4 (2) Rhode Island is the only state in New England that has no state-owned forests protected
5 in their natural state.
6 (3) The world is facing a biodiversity crisis where populations of native species are
7 declining at an alarming rate and many species are facing extinction. Native species in Rhode Island
8 are at risk of becoming regionally extinct due to habitat destruction.
9 (4) Old growth forests are significant ecosystems where native trees, plants, and animals
10 live.
11 (5) There are certain animals, insects, birds, and plants that only live in old growth forests.
12 (6) Old growth forests are important carbon sinks which store more carbon than an average
13 Rhode Island forest, and, if cut, would release its stored carbon into the atmosphere contributing to
14 Climate Change.
15 (7) Old growth forests are extremely rare, and once cut, may not come back for one hundred
16 (100) years or more.
17 (8) According to the 2020 forest action plan prepared jointly by the Rhode Island
18 department of environmental management and the United States forest service, only one percent

1 (1%) of Rhode Island’s forests are over one hundred (100) years old.
2 (9) Clearcutting, and other forms of destructive logging, increases the presence and spread
3 of invasive plants, which can outcompete native plants and harbor ticks.
4 (10) Natural heritage areas on state-owned land have been logged.
5 (11) Clearcutting of forests creates carbon emissions which does not comply with the goals
6 of chapter 6.2 of title 42 ("2021 act on climate").
7 (12) Clearcutting and most other types of logging of natural forests increase the occurrence
8 of destructive brush fire by promoting dry, flammable logging debris, small trees, and underbrush
9 including grassy weeds.
10 (13) Wildfires were at their lowest point when the state was dominated by old growth
11 forests due to old growth forests being more resistant to wildfires. Wildfires increased in the 19th
12 and early 20th centuries after the primeval old growth forests were clear cut.
13 (14) According to the United States Department of the Interior, nationally, almost nine (9)
14 out of ten (10) wildfires are caused by humans.
15 (15) In 2007, the Rhode Island natural heritage program was discontinued.
16 (16) Not one natural area preserve has been designated since the passage of chapter 122 of
17 title 42 ("natural areas protection act of 1993").
18 (17) According to the 2023 report, “Wildlands in New England,” based on research
19 conducted by Harvard Forest, Highstead Foundation, Northeast Wilderness Trust, and Wildlands,
20 Woodlands, Farmlands and Communities, Rhode Island is the only state in New England with no
21 protected Wildlands on public land.
22 (18) The natural area preserves qualify as wildlands.
23 (19) It is a matter of public benefit that old growth forests be untouched and left in their
24 natural state.
25 SECTION 2. Title 2 of the General Laws entitled "AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY"
26 is hereby amended by adding thereto the following chapter:

23 or prescribed burning takes place on state-owned land and land owned by the cities and towns of
24 Rhode Island. All extractive logging operations on state-owned land in forests over one acre in size
25 are subject to the approval of the council which upon consultation with the natural heritage program
26 shall determine whether the extractive logging operation involves clearcutting, or any other
27 ecologically destructive logging practice, or creates a fire hazard. No extractive logging operation
28 or prescribed burning operation shall take place until after the natural heritage program’s report
29 and after the council’s approval. There shall be a visual record of all extractive logging operations
30 on state-owned land, as well as felling of hazard trees and invasive trees in old growth forests on
31 state-owned land and land owned by the cities and towns of Rhode Island, and in the natural area
32 preserves, containing images and video of the trees intended to be felled and nearby trees before
33 and after the extractive logging operation and the felling of hazard trees and invasive trees takes
34 place. The visual record shall be the responsibility of the natural heritage program.
LC002978 - Page 5 of 12

1 (b) All extractive logging operations and prescribed burning operations of forests over one
2 acre in size on state-owned land shall only take place after a public hearing and upon notice. The

6 published in the county where the property is located and in a newspaper with statewide
7 distribution. No action shall be taken by the state prior to the expiration of sixty (60) days after the
8 notice is published. During the sixty (60) day period, any scheduled extractive logging operation
9 or prescribed burning operation may be appealed by any resident of this state in a suit brought
10 against the department of environmental management in the superior court in the county of
11 Providence. In any action, the court shall vacate the extractive logging operation or prescribed
12 burning operation if it finds the operation violates state or federal law. During the pendency of an
13 appeal the state shall take no action pursuant to the scheduled extractive logging operation or
14 prescribed burning operation.
15 (c) Whenever any land is acquired by the state, or any of its cities and towns, an inventory
16 shall be conducted by the natural heritage program to determine if the forest meets the criteria to
17 be designated as an old growth forest, natural heritage area, or rare forest ecosystem, as defined in
18 § 2-28-2. No extractive logging or prescribed burning shall take place in any acquired land by the
19 state before the natural heritage program completes its inventory.
20 (d) The natural heritage program, established pursuant to the provisions of § 42-167-2,
21 shall conduct an inventory of the forests on state-owned land and land owned by the cities and
22 towns to determine the extent and condition of old growth forest stands, natural heritage areas, and
23 rare forest ecosystems. The preliminary identification of old growth forest stands, natural heritage
24 areas, and rare forest ecosystems shall include an estimate of necessary buffer areas, including an
25 explanation of the rationale for the estimated size and shape of the buffer areas. The maps shall use
26 GIS type mapping software with data of species, land features, soil, water, invasives, and other
27 relevant ecological data in the map files. The maps and data shall be made available to the public
28 on a state website. All old growth forests, natural heritage areas, and rare forest ecosystems on
29 state-owned land identified in this inventory shall be considered for designation as natural area
30 preserves.
31 2-28-6. Preservation and protected funding.
32 Protecting the remaining areas of old growth forests, as defined in § 2-28-2, shall be a
33 priority for the State of Rhode Island and annual application to the general assembly by the division
34 of statewide planning for appropriations to fund the natural heritage program, established pursuant

EXPLANATION
BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL
OF
A N A C T
RELATING TO AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY -- OLD GROWTH FOREST
PROTECTION ACT
***
1 This act would create the old growth forest protection act to provide protection for state-
