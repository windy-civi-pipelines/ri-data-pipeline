9 as follows:
10 46-23-1. Legislative findings.
11 (a)(1) Under article 1, ยง 17 of the Rhode Island Constitution, the people shall continue to
12 enjoy and freely exercise all the rights of fishery, and the privileges of the shore, to which they
13 have been heretofore entitled under the charter and usages of this state, including, but not limited
14 to, fishing from the shore, the gathering of seaweed, leaving the shore to swim in the sea and
15 passage along the shore; and they shall be secure in their rights to use and enjoyment of the natural
16 resources of the state with due regard for the preservation of their values; and it is the duty of the
17 general assembly to provide for the conservation of the air, land, water, plant, animal, mineral and
18 other natural resources of the state, and to adopt all means necessary and proper by law to protect
19 the natural environment of the people of the state by providing adequate resource planning for the
20 control and regulation of the use of the natural resources of the state and for the preservation,
21 regeneration, and restoration of the natural environment of the state.
22 (2) The general assembly recognizes and declares that the coastal resources of Rhode
23 Island, a rich variety of natural, commercial, industrial, recreational, and aesthetic assets, are of
24 immediate and potential value to the present and future development of this state; that unplanned
25 or poorly planned development of this basic natural environment has already damaged or destroyed,
26 or has the potential of damaging or destroying, the state's coastal resources, and has restricted the
27 most efficient and beneficial utilization of these resources; that it shall be the policy of this state to
28 preserve, protect, develop, and, where possible, restore the coastal resources of the state for this
29 and succeeding generations through comprehensive and coordinated long range planning and
30 management designed to produce the maximum benefit for society from these coastal resources;
31 and that preservation and restoration of ecological systems shall be the primary guiding principle
32 upon which environmental alteration of coastal resources will be measured, judged, and regulated.
33 (b)(1) That effective implementation of these policies is essential to the social and
34 economic well-being of the people of Rhode Island because the sea and its adjacent lands are major
LC000326 - Page 5 of 36
1 sources of food and public recreation, because these resources are used by and for industry,
2 transportation, waste disposal, and other purposes, and because the demands made on these
3 resources are increasing in number, magnitude, and complexity; and that these policies are
4 necessary to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare. Pursuant to 16 U.S.C. ยง 1452
5 ("The Coastal Zone Management Act"), the general assembly hereby directs the division of coastal
6 resources management council (referred to as "CRMC" "DCRM") to exercise effectively its
7 responsibilities in the coastal zone through the development and implementation of management
8 programs to achieve wise use of the land and water resources of the coastal zone.
9 (2) Furthermore, that implementation of these policies is necessary in order to secure the
10 rights of the people of Rhode Island to the use and enjoyment of the natural resources of the state
11 with due regard for the preservation of their values, and in order to allow the general assembly to
12 fulfill its duty to provide for the conservation of the air, land, water, plant, animal, mineral, and
13 other natural resources of the state, and to adopt all means necessary and proper by law to protect
14 the natural environment of the people of the state by providing adequate resource planning for the
15 control and regulation of the use of the natural resources of the state and for the preservation,
16 regeneration, and restoration of the natural environment of the state.
17 (c) That these policies can best be achieved through the creation of a division of coastal
18 resources management, within the department of environmental management, council as the
19 principal mechanism for management of the state's coastal resources.
20 (d) The general assembly recognizes and declares that maintenance dredging is required to
21 remove natural silt accumulations; Rhode Island has not had a general maintenance dredging policy
22 and programs for ports, port facilities, channels, harbors, public and private marinas and boating
23 facilities, recreational facilities and habitat areas; other major coastal states have maintenance
24 dredging policies and in-water maintenance dredge disposal sites; as a result of the lack of a general
25 maintenance dredging policy and program and as a result there has been:
26 (1) A decrease in the depth of the Providence Channel from forty-four (44) feet in 1971 to
27 twenty-four (24) feet in 1996;
28 (2) Navigational restrictions on ocean going vessels through the state's waterways and
29 channels; and
30 (3) A decrease in the number of available slips and moorings at marinas throughout the
31 state; and the lack of a maintenance dredging policy and programs have significant adverse
32 environmental and economic effects on the state and therefore it is in the best interest of the state,
33 the cities and towns of the state, and the citizens thereof for the state to have a general maintenance
34 dredging policy and programs to resolve issues related to dredge maintenance and disposal and
LC000326 - Page 6 of 36
1 avoid future significant direct and indirect adverse impact on the environment and economy of the
2 state.
3 (e) The division of coastal resources management, within the department of environmental
4 management, council is hereby designated as the lead state agency for purposes of dredging in tidal
5 waters and as such shall have the following duties and responsibilities:
6 (1) To coordinate the interest of the state with regard to dredging;
7 (2) To formulate and adopt a state policy with regard to dredging which integrates those
8 interests;
9 (3) To cooperate with, negotiate, and to enter into agreements on behalf of the state with
10 the federal government and with other public bodies and private parties with regard to dredging;
11 (4) To act as the initial and primary point of contact for all applications to the state for
12 dredging projects in tidal waters;
13 (5) To develop, prepare, adopt pursuant to ยง 46-23-11, implement, and maintain a
14 comprehensive plan for dredge material management; and
15 (6) To cooperate and coordinate with the departments of environmental management,
16 transportation, administration, and health, and the economic development corporation in the
17 conduct of these duties and responsibilities.
18 (f)(1) The legislature recognizes that under Article I, ยง 17, the submerged lands of the state
19 are impressed with a public trust and that the state is responsible for the protection of the public's
20 interest in these lands. The state maintains title in fee to all soil within its boundaries that lies below
21 the high water mark, and it holds that land in trust for the use of the public. In benefiting the public,
22 the state preserves certain public rights which include, but are not limited to, fishery, commerce,
23 and navigation in these waters and the submerged lands that they cover.
24 (2) Since its establishment in 1971, the CRMC has had the authority to manage and plan
25 for the preservation of the coastal resources of the state including, but not limited to, submerged
26 lands. This authority is hereby transferred to the division of coastal resources management within
27 the department of environmental management. The legislature hereby declares that, in light of the
28 unique size, scope, and overall potential impact upon the environment of large scale filling projects
29 involving twenty-five (25) acres or more, any lease of tidal lands, or any license to use those lands,
30 is subject to approval, disapproval, or conditional approval by the direct enactment of the general
31 assembly by legislative action. The CRMC DCRM shall review all requests for leases, licenses to
32 use the land, and other authority to use the land made by any applicant prior to presentation of the
33 request to the general assembly, and the CRMC DCRM shall make recommendations on the request
34 to the general assembly. With the exception of any and all projects to fill land of twenty-five (25)
LC000326 - Page 7 of 36
1 acres or more, the general assembly hereby recognizes and declares that the CRMC DCRM is
2 delegated the sole and exclusive authority for the leasing of submerged and filled lands and giving
3 licenses for the use of that land. Accordingly, the CRMC DCRM will develop, coordinate, and
4 adopt a system for the leasing of submerged and filled lands, and licenses for the use of that land,
5 and will ensure that all leases and licenses are consistent with the public trust. Pursuant thereto, the
6 CRMC DCRM shall impose a maximum fee of eighty thousand dollars ($80,000) per annum for
7 any transatlantic cable that makes landfall in Rhode Island. All such fees collected shall be
8 deposited into the Bays, Rivers and Watersheds Fund, established pursuant to ยง 46-31-12.1, and
9 shall be disbursed according to the purposes of that fund. Nothing contained in this subsection
10 negates, repeals, or alters the provisions, processes, and requirements for the leasing of submerged
11 land for the conduct of aquaculture as set out under chapter 10 of title 20. Therefore, nothing in this
12 chapter shall be construed to limit or impair the authority of the state, or any duly established agency
13 of the state, to regulate filling or dredging affecting tidal lands owned by the state or any other
14 entity, and nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit or impair the obligation of the applicant
15 to obtain all applicable regulatory approvals. Specifically, and without limiting the foregoing,
16 nothing in this subsection negates, repeals, or alters the provisions, processes, and requirements for
17 water quality certification contained in chapter 12 of this title.
18 (3) Definitions. As used in this chapter the following words, unless the context clearly
19 requires otherwise, shall have the following meanings:
20 (i) "Department" or "DEM" means the department of environmental management.
21 (ii) "Director" means the director of the department of environmental management, or their
22 duly appointed agent, unless stated otherwise.
23 (iii) "Division" or "DCRM" means the division of coastal resources management.
24 (i)(iv) "Filled land" means portions of tidal lands which have been rendered by the acts of
25 man to be no longer subject to tidal action or beneath tidal waters.
26 (iii)(v) "Mean high water" means a line of contour representing the 18.6 year average as
27 determined by the metonic cycle and/or its equivalent as evidenced by the records, tidal datum, and
28 methodology of the United States Coastal Geodetic Survey within the National Oceanic and
29 Atmospheric Administration.
30 (ii)(vi) "Tidal Lands" means those lands that are below the mean high water.

10 (a) The public's rights and privileges of the shore are established by Article I, Sections 16
11 and 17 of the Rhode Island Constitution.
12 (b) For purposes of this chapter, the "recognizable high tide line" means a line or mark left
13 upon tidal flats, beaches, or along shore objects that indicates the intersection of the land with the
14 water's surface level at the maximum height reached by a rising tide. The recognizable high tide
15 line may be determined by a line of seaweed, oil or scum along shore objects, a more or less
16 continuous deposit of fine shell or debris on the foreshore or berm, other physical markings or
17 characteristics, or other suitable means that delineate the general height reached by the water's
18 surface level at a rising tide. If there is more than one line of seaweed, oil, scum, fine shell, or
19 debris, then the recognizable high tide line means the most seaward line. In the absence of residue
20 seaweed or other evidence, the recognizable high tide line means the wet line on a sandy or rocky
21 beach. The line encompasses the water's surface level at spring high tides and other high tides that
22 occur with periodic frequency, but does not include the water's surface level at storm surges in
23 which there is a departure from the normal or predicted reach of the water's surface level due to the
24 piling up of water against a coast by strong winds, such as those accompanying a hurricane or other
25 intense storms.
26 (c) Notwithstanding any provision of the general laws to the contrary, the public's rights
27 and privileges of the shore may be exercised, where shore exists, on wet sand or dry sand or rocky
28 beach, up to ten feet (10โฒ) landward of the recognizable high tide line; provided, however, that the

10 46-23-1. Legislative findings.
11 (a)(1) Under article 1, ยง 17 of the Rhode Island Constitution, the people shall continue to
12 enjoy and freely exercise all the rights of fishery, and the privileges of the shore, to which they
13 have been heretofore entitled under the charter and usages of this state, including, but not limited
14 to, fishing from the shore, the gathering of seaweed, leaving the shore to swim in the sea and
15 passage along the shore; and they shall be secure in their rights to use and enjoyment of the natural
16 resources of the state with due regard for the preservation of their values; and it is the duty of the
17 general assembly to provide for the conservation of the air, land, water, plant, animal, mineral and
18 other natural resources of the state, and to adopt all means necessary and proper by law to protect
19 the natural environment of the people of the state by providing adequate resource planning for the
20 control and regulation of the use of the natural resources of the state and for the preservation,
21 regeneration, and restoration of the natural environment of the state.
22 (2) The general assembly recognizes and declares that the coastal resources of Rhode
23 Island, a rich variety of natural, commercial, industrial, recreational, and aesthetic assets, are of
24 immediate and potential value to the present and future development of this state; that unplanned
25 or poorly planned development of this basic natural environment has already damaged or destroyed,
26 or has the potential of damaging or destroying, the state's coastal resources, and has restricted the
27 most efficient and beneficial utilization of these resources; that it shall be the policy of this state to
28 preserve, protect, develop, and, where possible, restore the coastal resources of the state for this
29 and succeeding generations through comprehensive and coordinated long range planning and
30 management designed to produce the maximum benefit for society from these coastal resources;
31 and that preservation and restoration of ecological systems shall be the primary guiding principle
32 upon which environmental alteration of coastal resources will be measured, judged, and regulated.
33 (b)(1) That effective implementation of these policies is essential to the social and
34 economic well-being of the people of Rhode Island because the sea and its adjacent lands are major
LC000326 - Page 5 of 36

1 sources of food and public recreation, because these resources are used by and for industry,
2 transportation, waste disposal, and other purposes, and because the demands made on these
3 resources are increasing in number, magnitude, and complexity; and that these policies are
4 necessary to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare. Pursuant to 16 U.S.C. ยง 1452
5 ("The Coastal Zone Management Act"), the general assembly hereby directs the division of coastal
6 resources management council (referred to as "CRMC" "DCRM") to exercise effectively its
7 responsibilities in the coastal zone through the development and implementation of management
8 programs to achieve wise use of the land and water resources of the coastal zone.
9 (2) Furthermore, that implementation of these policies is necessary in order to secure the
10 rights of the people of Rhode Island to the use and enjoyment of the natural resources of the state
11 with due regard for the preservation of their values, and in order to allow the general assembly to
12 fulfill its duty to provide for the conservation of the air, land, water, plant, animal, mineral, and
13 other natural resources of the state, and to adopt all means necessary and proper by law to protect
14 the natural environment of the people of the state by providing adequate resource planning for the
15 control and regulation of the use of the natural resources of the state and for the preservation,
16 regeneration, and restoration of the natural environment of the state.
17 (c) That these policies can best be achieved through the creation of a division of coastal
18 resources management, within the department of environmental management, council as the
19 principal mechanism for management of the state's coastal resources.
20 (d) The general assembly recognizes and declares that maintenance dredging is required to
21 remove natural silt accumulations; Rhode Island has not had a general maintenance dredging policy
22 and programs for ports, port facilities, channels, harbors, public and private marinas and boating
23 facilities, recreational facilities and habitat areas; other major coastal states have maintenance
24 dredging policies and in-water maintenance dredge disposal sites; as a result of the lack of a general
25 maintenance dredging policy and program and as a result there has been:
26 (1) A decrease in the depth of the Providence Channel from forty-four (44) feet in 1971 to
27 twenty-four (24) feet in 1996;
28 (2) Navigational restrictions on ocean going vessels through the state's waterways and
29 channels; and
30 (3) A decrease in the number of available slips and moorings at marinas throughout the
31 state; and the lack of a maintenance dredging policy and programs have significant adverse
32 environmental and economic effects on the state and therefore it is in the best interest of the state,
33 the cities and towns of the state, and the citizens thereof for the state to have a general maintenance
34 dredging policy and programs to resolve issues related to dredge maintenance and disposal and
LC000326 - Page 6 of 36

1 avoid future significant direct and indirect adverse impact on the environment and economy of the
2 state.
3 (e) The division of coastal resources management, within the department of environmental
4 management, council is hereby designated as the lead state agency for purposes of dredging in tidal
5 waters and as such shall have the following duties and responsibilities:
6 (1) To coordinate the interest of the state with regard to dredging;
7 (2) To formulate and adopt a state policy with regard to dredging which integrates those
8 interests;
9 (3) To cooperate with, negotiate, and to enter into agreements on behalf of the state with
10 the federal government and with other public bodies and private parties with regard to dredging;
11 (4) To act as the initial and primary point of contact for all applications to the state for
12 dredging projects in tidal waters;
13 (5) To develop, prepare, adopt pursuant to ยง 46-23-11, implement, and maintain a
14 comprehensive plan for dredge material management; and
15 (6) To cooperate and coordinate with the departments of environmental management,
16 transportation, administration, and health, and the economic development corporation in the
17 conduct of these duties and responsibilities.
18 (f)(1) The legislature recognizes that under Article I, ยง 17, the submerged lands of the state
19 are impressed with a public trust and that the state is responsible for the protection of the public's
20 interest in these lands. The state maintains title in fee to all soil within its boundaries that lies below
21 the high water mark, and it holds that land in trust for the use of the public. In benefiting the public,
22 the state preserves certain public rights which include, but are not limited to, fishery, commerce,
23 and navigation in these waters and the submerged lands that they cover.
24 (2) Since its establishment in 1971, the CRMC has had the authority to manage and plan
25 for the preservation of the coastal resources of the state including, but not limited to, submerged
26 lands. This authority is hereby transferred to the division of coastal resources management within
27 the department of environmental management. The legislature hereby declares that, in light of the
28 unique size, scope, and overall potential impact upon the environment of large scale filling projects
29 involving twenty-five (25) acres or more, any lease of tidal lands, or any license to use those lands,
30 is subject to approval, disapproval, or conditional approval by the direct enactment of the general
31 assembly by legislative action. The CRMC DCRM shall review all requests for leases, licenses to
32 use the land, and other authority to use the land made by any applicant prior to presentation of the
33 request to the general assembly, and the CRMC DCRM shall make recommendations on the request
34 to the general assembly. With the exception of any and all projects to fill land of twenty-five (25)
LC000326 - Page 7 of 36

1 acres or more, the general assembly hereby recognizes and declares that the CRMC DCRM is
2 delegated the sole and exclusive authority for the leasing of submerged and filled lands and giving
3 licenses for the use of that land. Accordingly, the CRMC DCRM will develop, coordinate, and
4 adopt a system for the leasing of submerged and filled lands, and licenses for the use of that land,
5 and will ensure that all leases and licenses are consistent with the public trust. Pursuant thereto, the
6 CRMC DCRM shall impose a maximum fee of eighty thousand dollars ($80,000) per annum for
7 any transatlantic cable that makes landfall in Rhode Island. All such fees collected shall be
8 deposited into the Bays, Rivers and Watersheds Fund, established pursuant to ยง 46-31-12.1, and
9 shall be disbursed according to the purposes of that fund. Nothing contained in this subsection
10 negates, repeals, or alters the provisions, processes, and requirements for the leasing of submerged
11 land for the conduct of aquaculture as set out under chapter 10 of title 20. Therefore, nothing in this
12 chapter shall be construed to limit or impair the authority of the state, or any duly established agency
13 of the state, to regulate filling or dredging affecting tidal lands owned by the state or any other
14 entity, and nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit or impair the obligation of the applicant
15 to obtain all applicable regulatory approvals. Specifically, and without limiting the foregoing,
16 nothing in this subsection negates, repeals, or alters the provisions, processes, and requirements for
17 water quality certification contained in chapter 12 of this title.
18 (3) Definitions. As used in this chapter the following words, unless the context clearly
19 requires otherwise, shall have the following meanings:
20 (i) "Department" or "DEM" means the department of environmental management.

12 (b) For purposes of this chapter, the "recognizable high tide line" means a line or mark left
13 upon tidal flats, beaches, or along shore objects that indicates the intersection of the land with the
14 water's surface level at the maximum height reached by a rising tide. The recognizable high tide
15 line may be determined by a line of seaweed, oil or scum along shore objects, a more or less
16 continuous deposit of fine shell or debris on the foreshore or berm, other physical markings or
17 characteristics, or other suitable means that delineate the general height reached by the water's
18 surface level at a rising tide. If there is more than one line of seaweed, oil, scum, fine shell, or
19 debris, then the recognizable high tide line means the most seaward line. In the absence of residue
20 seaweed or other evidence, the recognizable high tide line means the wet line on a sandy or rocky
21 beach. The line encompasses the water's surface level at spring high tides and other high tides that
22 occur with periodic frequency, but does not include the water's surface level at storm surges in
23 which there is a departure from the normal or predicted reach of the water's surface level due to the
24 piling up of water against a coast by strong winds, such as those accompanying a hurricane or other
25 intense storms.
26 (c) Notwithstanding any provision of the general laws to the contrary, the public's rights
27 and privileges of the shore may be exercised, where shore exists, on wet sand or dry sand or rocky
28 beach, up to ten feet (10โฒ) landward of the recognizable high tide line; provided, however, that the
29 public's rights and privileges of the shore shall not be afforded where no passable shore exists, nor
30 on land above the vegetation line, or on lawns, rocky cliffs, sea walls, or other legally constructed
31 shoreline infrastructure. Further, no entitlement is hereby created for the public to use amenities
32 privately owned by other persons or entities, including, but not limited to: cabanas, decks, and
33 beach chairs.
34 (d) Any landowner whose property abuts the shore shall, with respect to the public's
LC000326 - Page 33 of 36

1 exercise of rights and privileges of the shore as defined in this chapter, be afforded the liability
2 limitations pursuant to chapter 6 of title 32.
3 (e) The coastal resources management council (CRMC) in collaboration division of coastal
4 resources management with the approval of the department of environmental management (DEM),
5 shall develop and disseminate information to educate the public and property owners about the
6 rights set out in this section.
7 (f) The CRMC in collaboration division of coastal resources management with the DEM
8 approval of the department of environmental management, and the attorney general, shall
9 determine appropriate language and signage details for use at shoreline locations.

19 can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of
20 this chapter are declared to be severable.
21 46-23-28. Effective date.
22 (a) Within thirty (30) business days of the date of passage of this chapter, the department
23 of environmental management shall put out for notice and comment revisions of its coastal
24 resources management program (referred to as "red book") and management procedures in order
25 to implement the programmatic change from the council to the division.
