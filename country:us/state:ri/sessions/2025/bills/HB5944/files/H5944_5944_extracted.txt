4 As used in this chapter:
5 (1) “Director” means the director of the department of labor and training.
6 (2) “Economic necessity” means and refers to any case where the director determines that:

18 (iv) Maintenance or improvement of plant or equipment cannot practically or efficiently
1 be performed while production is in process;
2 (v) The scheduling of production on Sundays or holidays is necessitated by interrupted or
