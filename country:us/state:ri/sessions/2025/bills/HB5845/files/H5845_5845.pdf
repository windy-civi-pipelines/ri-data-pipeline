11 supplier.
12 (c) The assessment required by this section shall also include an evaluation of capital and

17 and disposal facilities serving all or part of the same area or that a good faith effort to do so has
18 been made. Plans shall be consistent with applicable local comprehensive plans and shall be
19 integrated into the water supply plans of the municipality or municipalities in which the service
20 area is located.
21 (e) Water supplier resilience plans shall designate the person or organization responsible
22 for taking each necessary action, others who must participate, and the time period in which each
