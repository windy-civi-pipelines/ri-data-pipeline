1 WHEREAS, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), known by many as Lou Gehrig's
2 disease, is a progressive fatal neurodegenerative disease in which a person's brain loses
3 connection with the muscles, slowly taking away their ability to walk, talk, eat, and eventually
4 breathe; and
5 WHEREAS, An estimated 30,000 individuals in the United States are afflicted with ALS
6 at any given time, with an estimated 5,000 new cases appearing each year, and annually, over
7 352,000 people affected worldwide; and
8 WHEREAS, Approximately 15 new cases of ALS are diagnosed every day, and every 90
9 minutes someone loses their battle with the disease; and
10 WHEREAS, On average, patients diagnosed with ALS only survive two to five years
11 from the time of diagnosis; and
12 WHEREAS, ALS has no cure and can strike anyone regardless of race, sex, age, or
13 ethnicity; and
14 WHEREAS, Securing access to new therapies, durable medical equipment, and
15 communication technologies is of vital importance to people living with ALS; and
16 WHEREAS, Clinical trials play a pivotal role in evaluating new treatments, enhancing
17 quality of life, and fostering assistive technologies for those living with ALS; and
18 WHEREAS, Persons who have served in the military are approximately twice as likely to
19 develop ALS and die from the disease than those with no history of military service; and

1 WHEREAS, The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs recognizes ALS as a service-
2 connected disease; and
3 WHEREAS, The ALS Association, as the largest philanthropic funder of ALS research
4 globally, has committed over $154 million to support more than 550 projects across the United
5 States and 18 other countries. The Association's commitment to accelerating the pace of
6 discovery remains unwavering, fueled by the hope that one day, ALS will be a livable disease for
7 everyone, everywhere, until a cure can be found; and
8 WHEREAS, The purpose of ALS Awareness Month is to raise public awareness about
9 ALS, show support for those affected by this relentless disease, and give recognition to those
10 working to find a cure; now, therefore be it
11 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
12 proclaims May of 2025, to be "ALS Awareness Month." We furthermore urge all the citizens of
13 the State to educate themselves on ALS and to help combat this disease by all means possible;
14 and be it further
15 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
16 transmit a duly certified copy of this resolution to the Rhode Island Chapter of the ALS
17 Foundation.
