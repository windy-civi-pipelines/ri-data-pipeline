16 SECTION 3. Sections 42-7.4-3 and 42-7.4-11 of the General Laws in Chapter 42-7.4
17 entitled "The Healthcare Services Funding Plan Act" are hereby amended to read as follows:
18 42-7.4-3. Imposition of healthcare services funding contribution. [As amended by P.L.
19 2024, ch. 423, § 1; See Compiler’s Note.]
20 (a) Each insurer is required to pay the healthcare services funding contribution for each
21 contribution enrollee of the insurer at the time the contribution is calculated and paid, at the rate set
22 forth in this section.
23 (1) Beginning July 1, 2024, the secretary shall set the healthcare services funding
24 contribution each fiscal year in an amount equal to: (i) The child immunization funding requirement
25 described in § 23-1-46; plus (ii) The adult immunization funding requirement described in § 23-1-
26 46; plus (iii) The children’s health services funding requirement described in § 42-12-29; plus (iv)
27 The psychiatry resource network funding requirement described in § 23-1-46.1; plus (v) The health

31 upon the insurer allowable by law.
32 (b) The contribution shall be paid by the insurer; provided, however, a person providing

1 contribution on that enrollee has been or will be made by the third-party administrator.
2 (c) The secretary shall create a process to facilitate the transition to the healthcare services
3 funding contribution method that: (i) assures adequate funding beginning July 1, 2016, (ii) reflects
4 that funding via the healthcare services funding contribution method initially will be for only a
5 portion of the state’s fiscal year, and (iii) avoids duplicate liability for any insurer that made a
6 payment under the premium assessment method in effect prior to January 1, 2016, for a period for
7 which it would also be liable for a contribution under the healthcare services funding contribution
8 method as described in this chapter.
9 42-7.4-11. Method of payment and deposit of contribution.
10 (a) The payments required by this chapter may be made by electronic transfer of monies to

15 described in § 23-1-46(a);
16 (2) To the “adult immunization account” described in § 23-1-45(c) in the amount described
17 in § 23-1-46(a);
18 (3) To the “children’s health account” described in § 42-12-29(a) in the amount described

21 157.2-4(a) in the amount described in § 42-157.2-4(b); and
22 (4)(5) Any remainder of the payments shall be proportionally distributed to those accounts
23 and credited against the next year’s healthcare services funding contribution.
24 (c) The general treasurer shall provide the secretary with a record of any monies transferred
25 and deposited.
26 SECTION 4. This act shall take effect upon passage.
