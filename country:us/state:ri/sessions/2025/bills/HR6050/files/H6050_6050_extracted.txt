OF RHODE ISLAND
Introduced By: Representatives Fogarty, Kazarian, Casimiro, Alzate, Stewart, Cruz,
Tanzi, Shekarchi, Blazejewski, and Chippendale
Date Introduced: March 11, 2025
Referred To: House read and passed
1 WHEREAS, International Women's Day has been observed since the early 1900s, at a
2 time when women's oppression and inequality were spurring women to become more vocal,
3 active, and demanding of change; and
4 WHEREAS, The first National Women's Day was observed in the United States on
5 February 28, 1909, during which women protested and demanded shorter work hours, better pay,
6 and voting rights; and
7 WHEREAS, In 1911, the first countries to honor International Women's Day were
8 Austria, Denmark, Germany, and Switzerland, with more than one million women and men
9 attending International Women's Day rallies, demanding women's rights including the right to
10 work, vote, and hold public office, and to put an end to discrimination in general; and
11 WHEREAS, In 1977, the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed March 8th as
12 International Women's Day throughout the world, a day that is celebrated in the United States and
13 globally; and
14 WHEREAS, International Women's Day has grown exponentially, nationally and
15 internationally, in both developed and developing countries alike; and
16 WHEREAS, The campaign theme for International Women's Day 2025 is "Accelerate
17 Action". This theme calls for people to take action to speed up gender equality. The World
18 Economic Forum estimates that it will take until 2158 to achieve gender parity at the current rate
19 of progress. At this rate, it would take approximately five generations to reach gender equality.
1 However, by taking action together, we can speed up the rate of progress; now, therefore be it
2 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
3 recognizes March 8, 2025, as "International Women's Day" in the State of Rhode Island; and be it
4 further
5 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
6 transmit a duly certified copy of this resolution to the Honorable Daniel McKee, Governor of the
7 State of Rhode Island.
