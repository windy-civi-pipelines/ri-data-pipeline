6 Pursuant to article XII of the Rhode Island constitution, it is the duty of the general
7 assembly to promote public schools, and to adopt all means which it may deem necessary and
8 proper to secure to the people the advantages and opportunities of education. It shall be the policy
9 of the state to provide a mechanism for the state to work with a city when its school district is
10 undergoing financial distress that threatens the fiscal well-being, public safety, and welfare of such
11 city and school district. The powers delegated by the general assembly in this chapter shall be
12 carried out having due regard for the needs of the citizens of the state and of the city of Warwick,
13 including the city's school district, and in such manner as will best preserve the education and
14 welfare of citizens of the state and the city of Warwick, including the city's school district, all to
15 the public benefit and good.

2 chapter 2 of title 38 ("access to public records"), chapter 14 of title 36 ("code of ethics"), and chapter
3 46 of title 42 ("open meetings").

6 for all purposes under the general laws, under any special law, and under the Warwick city charter.

7 assessments.
8 (c) Within one hundred twenty (120) days of being appointed, the Warwick public schools
9 budget commission shall develop a three (3) year operating and capital financial plan to achieve
10 fiscal stability in the school district. The plan shall include a preliminary analysis of the school

34 laws, or local laws, or of any rule or regulation of the state or the city including, but not limited to,
LC000955 - Page 3 of 5
1 title 16 and any state rule or regulation promulgated thereunder.
2 45-9.1-8. Liberal construction.
3 This chapter, being necessary for the welfare of the state, the city of Warwick and their
4 inhabitants, shall be liberally construed in order to effectuate its purposes.
5 45-9.1-9. Severability.
