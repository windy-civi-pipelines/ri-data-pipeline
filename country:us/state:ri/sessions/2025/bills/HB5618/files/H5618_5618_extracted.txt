EPINEPHRINE AUTOINJECTORS BY POLICE OFFICERS ACT
Introduced By: Representatives Cotter, Ajello, Noret, Potter, Carson, Fogarty, Donovan,
Spears, and Bennett
Date Introduced: February 26, 2025
Referred To: House Health & Human Services
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. The general assembly by hereby finds and declares:
2 (1) That a necessary course of action is needed to improve the safety of those in the State
3 of Rhode Island.
4 (2) While EMS employees, vehicles, and stations all carry epinephrine autoinjectors, police
5 officers are more likely to respond to a scene first.
6 (3) Saving time can save lives, and mandating police officers to carry epinephrine
7 autoinjectors will greatly reduce the complications and fatalities from anaphylaxis.
8 (4) Many allergens are unknown, whether by the patient or someone around them, and
9 anaphylaxis can set in quickly depending on the severity of the allergy. The longer the patient’s
10 throat is closed, the longer their body goes without receiving oxygen, which can lead to organ
11 failure, brain damage, and even death. That means that the time spent waiting for EMS to arrive
12 can mean the difference between full recovery and death.
13 (5) Additionally, police officers are often patrolling the streets of Rhode Island, unlike
14 EMS, and may notice or be drawn to an anaphylactic emergency in their district. Having no way to
15 help the patient(s) other than calling for EMS is a dangerous risk to take. Having an epinephrine
16 autoinjector available, as well as the skills necessary to administer it, is incredibly important when
17 there is no time to be wasted.
18 (6) It can be argued that police officers do not need more medical training than federally
1 mandated, as that is what EMS is for, but in reality, the more people who have the knowledge,
2 skills, and supplies to save lives, the better it is for everyone.
3 SECTION 2. Title 23 of the General Laws entitled "HEALTH AND SAFETY" is hereby
4 amended by adding thereto the following chapter:

10 the budget to effect compliance with the mandates of this chapter.
11 23-6.6-4. Penalties for failure to comply.
