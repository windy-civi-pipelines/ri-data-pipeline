Date Introduced: January 23, 2025
Referred To: Senate Finance
1 WHEREAS, Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, commonly referred to as
2 PFAS, are manmade chemicals found in a wide range of products, including, but not limited to,
3 adult mattresses, air care products, clothing, cleaning products, cookware, cosmetics, and many,
4 many more; and
5 WHEREAS, Increasingly, research shows that long-term exposure to products containing
6 PFAS creates heightened and increased health and safety risks to persons who are so exposed;
7 and
8 WHEREAS, By the nature of their work and the extent to which PFAS are found in more
9 and more items commonly found in private households and businesses, firefighters and rescue
10 personnel are particularly exposed to heightened amounts of PFAS in performing their duties as
11 firefighters and rescue personnel; and
12 WHEREAS, A significant percentage of current, in-use firefighter and rescue personnel
13 protective gear includes PFAS substances, and that exposure to PFAS substances is increased
14 when the materials containing PFAS are exposed to high temperatures, which firefighters and
15 rescue personnel face on daily basis; and
16 WHEREAS, There now exists recently-developed firefighter and rescue personnel
17 protective gear which is PFAS free, and the use of which, while not completely eliminating the
18 inherent possibility of exposure, would dramatically reduce the amount of exposure to PFAS
19 substances which firefighters and rescue personnel face regularly; and
1 WHEREAS, That the sum of fifteen million, two hundred thousand dollars ($15,200,000)
2 would enable the purchase of PFAS free personnel protective gear for approximately two
3 thousand, four hundred (2,400) professional firefighters and one thousand, four hundred (1,400)
4 volunteer firefighters, across the state; now therefore be it
5 RESOLVED, That there is hereby appropriated, out of any money in the treasury not
6 otherwise appropriated for fiscal year 2025-2026, the sum of fifteen million, two hundred
7 thousand dollars ($15,200,000) for those cities and towns in the State of Rhode Island to purchase
8 firefighter and rescue personnel protective gear which is PFAS free; and the state controller is
9 hereby authorized and directed to draw his orders upon the general treasurer for the payment of
10 said sum, or so much thereof as may be from time to time required, upon receipt of properly
11 authenticated vouchers.
