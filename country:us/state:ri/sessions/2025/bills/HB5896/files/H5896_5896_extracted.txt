12 his or her discretion and revoke the conditional hardship license, extend the time period for the

19 (c) However, in any case where a motorist is convicted of an alcohol-related offense
20 pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, the judge or magistrate may exercise his or her discretion
21 in the granting of the hardship license by imposing up to a ninety (90) day loss of license prior to
22 any imposition of the hardship license. The hardship license shall be valid for twelve (12)
23 continuous hours per day for any valid reason approved in advance by the sentencing judge or
24 magistrate, which shall include employment, medical appointments, job training, schooling, or

12 for a period of six (6) months subsequent to the penalties enumerated in § 31-11-18.1.

23 require; and
24 (3) Require the person to pay the reasonable cost of leasing or buying, monitoring, and

28 motor vehicles if the individual is not monitored as a condition of the individual’s plea or finding
29 of guilt.
30 (h) Any person granted a conditional hardship license upon proof of installation of an
31 ignition interlock device, may operate that motor vehicle during the entire twelve-hour (12) period

LC001491 - Page 5 of 8
1 vehicle owned or provided by the person’s employer, the person may operate that motor vehicle in

21 in the granting of the hardship license by imposing up to a ninety (90) day loss of license prior to
22 any imposition of the hardship license. The hardship license shall be valid for twelve (12)
23 continuous hours per day for any valid reason approved in advance by the sentencing judge or
24 magistrate, which shall include employment, medical appointments, job training, schooling, or
25 religious purposes. The hardship license shall not be for less than twelve (12) continuous hours per
26 day. A hardship license shall only be granted in conjunction with the installation of an ignition
27 interlock device and/or blood and urine testing. Any conditional driving privileges must be set by
28 the sentencing judge or magistrate after a hearing in which the motorist must provide proof of
29 employment status and hours of employment, or any other legitimate reasons justifying a hardship
30 license. These shall include, but not be limited to, any unemployment training, schooling, medical
31 appointments, therapy treatments, or any other valid requests set forth by sworn affidavit. Once
32 said hardship period has concluded, the motorist must still be subject to the conditions of the
33 ignition interlock system and/or blood and urine testing as set forth under this section for the period
34 of time as directed by the court. Any individual who violates the requirements of this subsection
LC001491 - Page 4 of 8

1 shall be subject to the penalties enumerated in § 31-11-18.1.
2 (d) Any person convicted of an offense of driving under the influence of liquor or drugs
3 resulting in death, § 31-27-2.2; driving under the influence of liquor or drugs resulting in serious
4 bodily injury, § 31-27-2.6; driving to endanger resulting in death, § 31-27-1; or driving to endanger
5 resulting in serious bodily injury, § 31-27-1.1; may, in addition to any other penalties provided by
6 law, be prohibited from operating a motor vehicle that is not equipped with an approved ignition
7 interlock system and/or blood and urine testing for one to five (5) years.
8 (e) Any person who operates a motor vehicle with a suspended license during the period
9 of suspension, and the reason for the suspension was due to a conviction of driving under the
10 influence of drugs or alcohol or a sustained violation or conviction of refusal to submit to a chemical
11 test, shall be subject to the further use of the ignition interlock system and/or blood and urine testing
12 for a period of six (6) months subsequent to the penalties enumerated in § 31-11-18.1.
13 (f) When the court orders the use of an ignition interlock system, the judge or magistrate
14 shall cause an appropriate notation to be made on the person’s record that clearly sets forth the
15 requirement for, and the period of the use of, the ignition interlock system.
16 (g) In addition to the requirements of subsection (f) of this section, the court or traffic
17 tribunal shall:
18 (1) Require proof of the installation of the ignition interlock system and periodic reporting
19 by the person for the purpose of verification of the proper operation of the ignition interlock system;
20 (2) Require the person to have the ignition interlock system monitored for the proper use
21 and accuracy by a person, firm, corporation, or other association to be approved by the division of
22 motor vehicles at least once every six (6) months, or more frequently as the circumstances may
23 require; and
24 (3) Require the person to pay the reasonable cost of leasing or buying, monitoring, and
25 maintenance of the ignition interlock system.
26 (4) The requirements under subsection (g) of this section shall be the responsibility of the
27 probation department or justice assistance, if the individual is under their control, or the division of
28 motor vehicles if the individual is not monitored as a condition of the individual’s plea or finding
29 of guilt.
30 (h) Any person granted a conditional hardship license upon proof of installation of an
31 ignition interlock device, may operate that motor vehicle during the entire twelve-hour (12) period
32 of operation granted by the sentencing judge or magistrate including during the scope of the
33 person’s employment and/or any other valid reason approved by the sentencing judge or magistrate.
34 (i) If a person is required, in the course of the person’s employment, to operate a motor
LC001491 - Page 5 of 8

1 vehicle owned or provided by the person’s employer, the person may operate that motor vehicle in
2 the course of the person’s employment without installation of an ignition interlock system if the
3 court makes specific findings expressly permitting the person to operate, in the course of the
4 person’s employment, a motor vehicle that is not equipped with an ignition interlock system.
5 (j) If a judge or magistrate finds after hearing that a motorist is in violation of an interlock
6 order, or has failed to comply with the terms and conditions imposed with an ignition interlock
7 system including, but not limited to, operating a motor vehicle without an ignition interlock system
8 installed, the judge or magistrate may adjudge the motorist in contempt of the court's order, and
9 exercise their discretion by revoking, modifying or amending the conditional hardship license or
10 ignition interlock order, extending the time period for the ignition interlock system for an additional
11 period of twelve (12) months and/or imposing an additional loss of license for up to twenty-four
12 (24) months.
13 (1) Any person subject to an ignition interlock order and/or blood and urine testing who
14 violates such order shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year imprisonment,
15 or a fine of up to one thousand dollars ($1,000), or both.
16 (2) For a second violation within six (6) months from entry of the order, the person
17 violating the order shall be imprisoned for a term of not less than ten (10) days and not more than
18 one year.
19 (k) For the purposes of this subsection, a violation of the interlock order, includes, but is
20 not limited to:
21 (1) Altering, tampering, or in any way attempting to circumvent the operation of an ignition
22 interlock system that has been installed in the motor vehicle of a person under this section;
23 (2) Operating a motor vehicle that is not equipped with an ignition interlock system; or
24 (3) Soliciting or attempting to have another person start a motor vehicle equipped with an
25 ignition interlock system for the purpose of providing an operable motor vehicle to a person who
26 is prohibited from operating a motor vehicle that is not equipped with an ignition interlock system.
27 (l) Any person who attempts to start, or starts, a motor vehicle equipped with an ignition
28 interlock system, tampers with, or in any way attempts to circumvent, the operation of an ignition
29 interlock system that has been installed in the motor vehicle for the purpose of providing an
30 operable motor vehicle to a person who is prohibited from operating a motor vehicle that is not
31 equipped with an ignition interlock system, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by up to
32 one year imprisonment or a fine of up to one thousand dollars ($1,000), or both.
