Date Introduced: March 27, 2025
Referred To: Senate Judiciary
It is enacted by the General Assembly as follows:
1 SECTION 1. Sections 38-2-1, 38-2-2, 38-2-3, 38-2-3.2, 38-2-3.16, 38-2-4, 38-2-7, 38-2-9,

3 hereby amended to read as follows:
4 38-2-1. Purpose.
5 The public’s right to access to public records and the individual’s right to dignity and
6 privacy are both recognized to be principles of the utmost importance in a free society. The purpose
7 of this chapter is to facilitate public access to public records. It is also the intent of this chapter to
8 protect from disclosure information about particular individuals maintained in the files of public
9 bodies when disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy as specified
10 by the exemptions contained in this chapter.
11 38-2-2. Definitions.
12 As used in this chapter:

25 is the basis of the exclusion. If an entire document or record is deemed non-public, the public body

2 submitted at a public meeting of a public body shall be deemed public and shall also be made
3 available upon request to any member of the public present at the meeting.
4 (c)(d) Each public body shall make, keep, and maintain written or recorded minutes of all
5 meetings.
6 (d)(e) Each public body shall establish written procedures regarding access to public
7 records but shall not require written requests for public information available pursuant to § 42-35-
8 2 or for other documents prepared for or readily available to the public, including any documents
9 reviewed, considered, or submitted at a public meeting of a public body.
10 These procedures must include, but need not be limited to, the identification of a designated
11 public records officer or unit, how to make a public records request, and where a public record
12 request should be made, and a copy of these procedures shall be posted on the public body’s website
13 if such a website is maintained and shall be made otherwise readily available to the public. The
14 unavailability of a designated public records officer shall not be deemed good cause for failure to
15 timely comply with a request to inspect and/or copy public records pursuant to subsection (e). A
16 link to the public body's procedures shall be prominently displayed on the home page of its website,
17 including a link to the appropriate webpage if the public body requires that requests be submitted

19 be made on a form established by a public body if the request is otherwise readily identifiable as a
20 request for public records. The procedures shall allow requests for public records to be submitted
21 in person, by regular and electronic mail, and, at the public body's discretion, by fax or online
22 portal.
23 (f) A requester's failure to follow the written procedures established by a public body shall
24 not, by itself, serve as a basis to fail to comply with a request for public records.
25 (g) If a request for records is sent to a public body other than through the designated public
26 records officer or unit, the recipient of the request shall be responsible for forwarding it to the
27 designated officer or unit. In such circumstances, the public body shall have an additional five (5)
28 days to respond to the request, notwithstanding the provisions of § 38-2-7, but shall not be found
29 in violation of this chapter for responding beyond this timeframe if the public body has acted in
30 good faith in responding.
31 (e)(h) A public body receiving a request shall permit the inspection or copying within ten
32 (10) business days after receiving a request. If the inspection or copying is not permitted within ten
33 (10) business days, the public body shall forthwith explain in writing the need for additional time
34 to comply with the request. Any such explanation must be particularized to the specific request
LC002603 - Page 7 of 15

1 made. In such cases the public body may have up to an additional twenty (20) business days to
2 comply with the request if it can demonstrate with specificity that the voluminous nature of the
3 request, the number of requests for records pending (in which case the number of pending requests
4 shall be cited in the response), or the difficulty in searching for and retrieving or copying the
5 requested records, is such that additional time is necessary to avoid imposing an undue burden on
6 the public body. The response times established by this subsection, §§ 38-2-3.2(a), and 38-2-
7 2(4)(D)(II) may be further extended only with the explicit written consent of the requester.
8 (i) The unavailability of a designated public records officer shall not be deemed good cause
9 for failure to timely comply with a request to inspect and/or copy public records pursuant to
10 subsection (h) of this section.
11 (f)(j) If a public record is in active use or in storage and, therefore, not available at the time
12 a person or entity requests access, the custodian shall so inform the person or entity and make an
13 appointment for the person or entity to examine such records as expeditiously as they may be made
14 available.
15 (g)(k) Any person or entity requesting copies of public records may elect to obtain them in
16 any and all media in which the public agency is capable of providing them. Any public body which
17 maintains its records in a computer storage system shall provide any data properly identified in a
18 printout or other reasonable format, as requested, including a format allowing the documents to be
19 searchable electronically where feasible.
20 (h)(l) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a public body to reorganize,
21 consolidate, or compile data not maintained by the public body in the form requested at the time
22 the request to inspect the public records was made except to the extent that such records are in an
23 electronic format and the public body would not be unduly burdened in providing such data.
24 (i)(m) Nothing in this section is intended to affect the public record status of information
25 merely because it is stored in a computer.
26 (j)(n) No public records shall be withheld based on the purpose for which the records are
27 sought, nor shall a public body require, as a condition of fulfilling a public records request, that a
28 person or entity provide a reason for the request or provide personally identifiable information
29 about him/herself.
30 (k)(o) At the election of the person or entity requesting the public records, the public body
31 shall provide copies of the public records electronically, by facsimile, or by mail in accordance
32 with the requesting person or entity’s choice, unless complying with that preference would be
33 unduly burdensome due to the volume of records requested or the costs that would be incurred. The
34 person requesting delivery shall be responsible for the actual cost of delivery, if any.
LC002603 - Page 8 of 15

1 (p) Any provision in a contractual or other agreement entered into by a public body with a
2 third party that purports to keep records confidential that are otherwise public under this chapter
3 shall be deemed null and void; nor shall a public body delegate to a private party the determination
4 as to what information provided by that party is exempt from disclosure under this chapter.
5 38-2-3.2. Arrest logs.
6 (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of § 38-2-3(e), the following information reflecting an
7 initial arrest of an adult and charge or charges shall be made available within forty-eight (48) hours
8 after receipt of a request unless a request is made on a weekend or holiday, in which event the
9 information shall be made available within seventy-two (72) hours, to the extent such information
10 is known by the public body:
11 (1) Full name of the arrested adult;
12 (2) Home address of the arrested adult, unless doing so would identify a crime victim;
13 (3) Year of birth of the arrested adult;

20 (b) The provisions of this section shall apply to arrests made within five (5) thirty (30) days
21 prior to the request, and the attorney general shall prepare a uniform log form for public bodies to
22 use to facilitate compliance with this section.
23 38-2-3.16. Compliance by agencies and public bodies.
24 Not later than January 1, 2013, and annually thereafter, the chief administrator of each
25 agency and each public body shall state in writing to the attorney general that all officers and
26 employees who have the authority to grant or deny persons or entities access to records under this
27 chapter have been provided orientation and training regarding this chapter. The attorney general
28 may, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 35 of title 42, promulgate rules and regulations
29 necessary to implement the requirements of this section, and shall annually, and not later than
30 March 1, post online a list of those public bodies that have provided the statement required by this
31 section, and those public bodies that, having submitted a statement in any previous year, have failed
32 to do so for the current year.
33 38-2-4. Cost.
34 (a) Subject to the provisions of § 38-2-3, a public body must allow copies to be made or
LC002603 - Page 9 of 15

2 public shall not exceed fifteen cents ($.15) five cents ($.05) per page for documents copyable on
3 common business or legal size paper. A public body may not charge more than the reasonable
4 actual cost for providing electronic records or retrieving records from storage where the public
5 body is assessed a retrieval fee.
6 (b) A reasonable charge may be made for the search or retrieval of documents. Hourly costs
7 for a search and retrieval shall not exceed fifteen dollars ($15.00) per hour and no costs shall be
8 charged for the first hour two (2) hours of a search or retrieval or for the first two (2) hours used
9 for the redaction of documents. No charge shall be imposed for the denial of a request for records.

16 for search and retrieval.
17 (e) A public body, the attorney general, and the court may shall reduce or waive the fees
18 for costs charged for search or retrieval if it determines that the requester demonstrates that the
19 information requested is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public
20 understanding of the operations or activities of the government and affirms that the request is not
21 primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Any requester denied a reduction or waiver
22 of fees, or seeking to contest the amount of a reduction, by a public body or the attorney general
23 may file suit pursuant to the provisions of § 38-2-9. The matter shall be reviewed de novo by the
24 court.
25 38-2-7. Denial of access.
26 (a) Any denial of the right to inspect or copy records, in whole or in part provided for under
27 this chapter shall be made to the person or entity requesting the right in writing giving the specific
28 reasons for the denial within ten (10) business days of the request and indicating the procedures for
29 appealing the denial. Except for good cause shown, any reason not specifically set forth in the
30 denial shall be deemed waived by the public body.
31 (b) Failure to comply with a request to inspect or copy the public record within the ten (10)
32 business day period shall be deemed to be a denial. Except that for good cause shown, this limit
33 may be extended in accordance with the provisions of § 38-2-3(e) 38-2-3(h). All copying and search
34 and retrieval fees shall be waived if a public body fails to produce requested records in a timely
LC002603 - Page 10 of 15

1 manner; provided, however, that the production of records shall not be deemed untimely if the
2 public body is awaiting receipt of payment for costs properly charged under § 38-2-4.
3 (c) A public body that receives a request to inspect or copy records that do not exist or are
4 not within its custody or control shall, in responding to the request in accordance with this chapter,
5 state that it does not have or maintain the requested records.
6 38-2-9. Jurisdiction of superior court.
7 (a) Jurisdiction to hear and determine civil actions brought under this chapter is hereby
8 vested in the superior court.
9 (b) The court may examine any record which is the subject of a suit in camera to determine
10 whether the record or any part thereof may be withheld from public inspection under the terms of
11 this chapter.
12 (c) Actions brought under this chapter may be advanced on the calendar upon motion of
13 any party, or sua sponte by the court made in accordance with the rules of civil procedure of the
14 superior court.
15 (d) The court shall impose a civil fine not exceeding two thousand dollars ($2,000) four
16 thousand dollars ($4,000) against a public body or official found to have committed a knowing and

18 thousand dollars ($2,000) against a public body found to have recklessly violated this chapter and
19 shall award reasonable attorney fees and costs to the prevailing plaintiff. In the instance of a court
20 having found a knowing and willful violation, the court may also, taking into consideration any
21 delays in the prosecution and appeal of a request denial, impose a fine of up to one hundred dollars
22 ($100) per day for each day that records were improperly withheld, and may further award
23 compensatory and punitive damages. The court shall further order a public body found to have
24 wrongfully denied access to public records to provide the records at no cost to the prevailing party;
25 provided, further, that in the event that the court, having found in favor of the defendant, finds
26 further that the plaintiff’s case lacked a grounding in fact or in existing law or in good faith
27 argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law, the court may award
28 attorney’s fees and costs to the prevailing defendant. A judgment in the plaintiff’s favor shall not
29 be a prerequisite to obtaining an award of attorney’s fees and/or costs if the court determines that
30 the defendant’s case lacked grounding in fact or in existing law or a good faith argument for
31 extension, modification or reversal of existing law.
32 (e) Any civil fines imposed under this section shall be placed in a restricted receipt account
33 of the state and shall be used to provide grants to municipalities to support information technology
34 capabilities that will increase the public's online access to public records.

7 information as to how many complaints were found to be meritorious and the action taken by the
8 attorney general in response to those complaints. The attorney general shall publish on a keyword
9 searchable website the full text of all findings and decisions issued by the attorney general in
10 response to those complaints, all advisory opinions issued under this chapter, and the annual reports
11 issued pursuant to this section.
12 SECTION 2. Chapter 38-2 of the General Laws entitled "Access to Public Records" is
13 hereby amended by adding thereto the following section:
14 38-2-17. Vexatious requests.
15 (a) If a person makes a request to view or copy a public record that is part of a series of
16 contemporaneous requests filed with the intent to disrupt government operations, the chief
17 administrative officer of the public body may petition the superior court for an order to relieve the
18 custodian of the records from fulfilling the request.
19 (b) A chief administrative officer shall not petition a court for relief unless the officer or
20 the custodian of the records has provided in writing to the person making the request the specific
21 reasons that the request is considered an attempt to disrupt government operations in violation of
22 this section, and the person has continued to engage in such conduct after the notification. Reliance
23 solely on the number of requests filed or the number of records sought shall not be a basis for
24 deeming the request an intent to disrupt government operations.
25 (c) After a petition is filed and while the case is pending, the records custodian shall
26 continue to comply with the request, but if the chief administrative officer prevails, the person
27 making the requests shall reimburse the custodian for the reasonable costs incurred in producing
28 the records during the pendency of the case, in accordance with § 38-2-4.
29 (d) A court may, upon finding by clear and convincing evidence that a records request was
30 made with the intent to disrupt government operations, issue an order authorizing the custodian of
31 the records to ignore the request that is the subject of the complaint.
32 (e) Upon a second finding that a person has filed a request with the intent to disrupt
33 government operations, a court may provide additional appropriate relief including, but not limited
34 to, an order that the custodian of the records need not comply with future requests from the person

1 for a specified period of time, but not to exceed one year.
2 (f) If a complaint brought under this section is dismissed by the court or the chief
3 administrative officer without a requisite finding of an attempt to disrupt government operations,
4 the requester of the records shall be entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. If
5 the court determines that the complaint lacked grounding in fact or law, the requester shall in
6 addition be entitled to an award of damages not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000).
7 38-2-18. Traffic accident and improvement data.
8 Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter or state law, any records that, under 23
9 U.S.C. § 407, are not discoverable or admissible in court proceedings or allowed to be considered
10 for other purposes in damages actions shall nonetheless be deemed public records; provided,
11 however, the records may not be used for purposes prohibited by that federal statute. When making
12 the records public, whether in response to a request pursuant to this chapter or otherwise, a public
13 body may provide written notice of the aforementioned restrictions on their use.
14 38-2-19. Preferred license plates.
15 Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter or state law, and to the extent not
16 prohibited by the Driver's Privacy Protection Act of 1994, 18 U.S.C. § 2721 et seq., the names of
17 any individuals who obtain a preferred license plate shall be a public record available upon request.
18 A "preferred license plate" means a license plate of one to four (4) digits, or a combination of one
19 to two (2) letters and one to three (3) digits, whose issuance is approved by, or subject to the
20 approval of, the office of the governor.
21 SECTION 3. Section 39-21.1-17 of the General Laws in Chapter 39-21.1 entitled "911
22 Emergency Telephone Number Act" is hereby amended to read as follows:
23 39-21.1-17. Confidentiality of calls.
24 (a) All telephone calls and telephone call transmissions, including electronic text message,
25 photos or videos, received pursuant to this chapter and all tapes containing records of telephone
26 calls shall remain confidential and used only for the purpose of handling emergency calls and for
27 public safety purposes as may be needed for law enforcement, fire, medical, rescue or other
28 emergency services. The calls shall not be released to any other parties without the written consent
29 of the caller whose voice is recorded, or upon order of the court.
30 (b) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, calls shall be released to third parties:
31 (1) Upon good cause shown;
32 (2) Upon order of the court; or
33 (3) Upon request, to:
34 (i) The individual placing the call;

1 (ii) Any individual who is heard on the call communicating information to or for the
2 emergency responder or operator; and
3 (iii) The subject(s) of the call who required emergency services or, if they are incapacitated
4 or deceased, their next of kin.
5 SECTION 4. This act shall take effect upon passage.

EXPLANATION
BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL
OF
A N A C T
RELATING TO PUBLIC RECORDS -- ACCESS TO PUBLIC RECORDS
***
1 This act would make numerous changes to the access to public records act, including
2 clarifying various provisions, increasing the sanctions for knowing and willful violations of the
3 law, and making certain traffic accident data and preferred license plate information public.
4 Additionally, this act would include a police report of an incident that does not lead to an arrest as
5 accessible to public records request. Any final reports of investigations conducted by internal
6 affairs would be accessible to public records request. All police worn body camera footage would
7 be accessible to public records request and would be made available within thirty (30) days. Arrest
8 logs made within thirty (30) days of arrest, changed from five (5) days previously, would be
9 accessible to public records request. A civil fine for public officials who knowingly violate this
10 chapter would increase from two thousand dollars ($2,000) to four thousand dollars ($4,000), and
11 if a public official recklessly violates this chapter a fine of two thousand dollars ($2,000) this is a
12 change from one thousand dollars ($1,000) previously. There would also be relief in the case of a
13 person filing frivolous request with the intent to disrupt government operations.
14 This act would take effect upon passage.
