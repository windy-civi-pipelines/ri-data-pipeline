RETIREMENT
Introduced By: Representatives Bennett, Shekarchi, Blazejewski, Chippendale,
Edwards, Diaz, Azzinaro, Kazarian, Solomon, and Finkelman
Date Introduced: May 08, 2025
Referred To: House read and passed
1 WHEREAS, Over the past fifty-six years, Donna Policastro has educated, monitored, and
2 administered to the needs of the people of Rhode Island as a dedicated and devoted registered
3 nurse; and
4 WHEREAS, Ms. Policastro began her career in the emergency room at Roger Williams
5 General Hospital, and after a year and a half, she undertook a position as the evening charge
6 nurse at Butler Hospital. With the hope of finding her “niche” as a nurse, she then shifted to the
7 world of community health, and began working with the Providence Health Centers; and
8 WHEREAS, In 1976, Ms. Policastro attended the New Jersey College of Medicine and
9 Dentistry, and subsequently returned to Rhode Island as an OB/GYN nurse practitioner. At that
10 time, the women’s health nursing field had very few practitioners in Rhode Island; and
11 WHEREAS, Ms. Policastro, along with the small but dedicated group of OB/GYN nurse
12 practitioners, chose to band together in order to work on passage of legislation to make
13 improvements dealing with prescriptive privileges, third party reimbursement, global signature
14 authority, Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs) consensus model, and surgical smoke
15 evacuation-in all operating rooms that generated smoke during an operative procedure; and
16 WHEREAS, Ms. Policastro’s most memorable accomplishments during those years were
17 speaking in favor of the Affordable Care Act representing the American Nurses’ Association
18 before the Congressional Ways and Means Committee consisting of 3.2 million nurses, and
19 leading the charge in founding the Rhode Island Nurses Institute Middle College Charter School,
1 and later in 2014, when she was asked to once again build a regional model for APRN’s members
2 which was introduced in 2018; and
3 WHEREAS, In 2005, after having gained invaluable knowledge and the respect of her
4 colleagues, Ms. Policastro was appointed Executive Director of the Rhode Island State Nurses
5 Association (RISNA), a position she held for the following two decades; and
6 WHEREAS, After more than five and a half decades in nursing and administration, Ms.
7 Policastro stepped down as Executive Director in the Spring of 2025, to serve as a contract
8 lobbyist and representative for the Nurse Practitioner Alliance of Rhode Island; and
9 WHEREAS, Over the course of her distinguished career, Donna Policastro has earned
10 and received myriad awards and honors for her contributions to the nursing profession, or as she
11 would say “…a nurse who takes care of nurses”, which in turn, has had a positive impact on the
12 lives of generations of citizens in Rhode Island; now, therefore be it
13 RESOLVED, That this House of Representatives of the State of Rhode Island hereby
14 honors and thanks Donna Policastro for fifty-six years of working to better the health and lives of
15 the people of this State. We wish her much happiness, and good health in her well-earned
16 retirement; and be it further
17 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of State be and hereby is authorized and directed to
18 transmit a duly certified copy of this resolution to Donna Policastro.
