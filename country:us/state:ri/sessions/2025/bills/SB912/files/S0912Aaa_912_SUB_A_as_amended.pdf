3 programs, admissions policies, employment practices, and all other operations. The board of
4 regents shall not approve a charter to a school whose overall operation or education program is
5 managed by a for profit entity.
6 (e) The commissioner is empowered to promulgate rules and regulations consistent with
7 this chapter, in conformance with chapter 35 of title 42, for the creation and operation of charter
8 public schools. These rules and regulations shall set forth the process for rescission of state approval
9 of a charter public school, including appropriate protections to ensure the continued provision of
10 education services to the students of the charter public school whose charter is rescinded.

20 considered “service” as that term is defined in chapter 16 of this title for purposes of determining
21 the appropriate step on a salary schedule for certified personnel. Employment in an independent
22 charter school can be considered “service” as that term is defined in chapter 16 of this title for
23 determining status in the teachers’ retirement system. All employees, and prospective employees
24 of an independent charter school shall be deemed to be public school employees, having the same
25 rights under Rhode Island and federal law as employees, and prospective employees at a non-
26 chartered public school;
27 (13) Requires all independent charter schools, upon renewal of a certified charter or
28 application for a new charter school to create a "union neutrality clause" that provides the
29 following:
30 (i) To remain neutral, regarding the unionization of any of its employees such that the
31 charter school shall not at any time express a position on the matter of whether its employees should
32 be unionized and such that the charter school shall not threaten, intimidate, discriminate against,
33 retaliate against, or take any adverse action against any employees based on their decision to
34 support or oppose union representation;
LC001636/SUB A - Page 12 of 18

1 (ii) That the charter school shall provide any bona fide labor organization access at
2 reasonable times to areas in which the charter school's employees work for the purpose of meeting
3 with employees to discuss their right to representation, employment rights under the law, and terms
4 and conditions of employment; and
5 (iii) That union recognition shall be through a majority card check verified by a neutral
6 third-party arbitrator mutually selected by the charter school and the bona fide labor organization
7 through alternate striking from a panel of arbitrators provided by the Federal Mediation and
8 Conciliation Service.
9 (13)(14) Identify, with particularity, the state statutes, state regulations, and sending school
10 district(s) rules from which variances are sought in order to facilitate operation of the independent
11 charter school. Explain the reasons for each variance and the alternative method by which the
12 concern that gave rise to the regulation or provision will be addressed;
13 (14)(15) Provide a financial plan, including a proposed budget for the term of the charter,
14 and an annual audit of the financial and administrative operations of the independent charter school,
15 and the manner in which the funds allocated to the independent charter school will be managed and
16 disbursed;
17 (15)(16) Provide procedures by which teaching personnel and parents can legally challenge
18 decisions of the governing board of the school that do not conform to the school’s charter;
19 (16)(17) Provide a copy of the proposed bylaws of the independent charter school; and
20 (17)(18) Provide written support from town or city council(s) in the proposed catchment
21 area if required pursuant to § 16-77-5.1.
22 (b) Any nonprofit organization that seeks to establish an independent charter school must
23 submit its financial records and financial plan for operating the school to the auditor general, who
24 shall review the records, the financial plan, and the financial integrity of the organization. At the
25 time of submission of a proposed charter, the financial records and financial recordkeeping system
26 of the nonprofit organization and the proposed financial plan for the independent charter school
27 shall be reviewed by the auditor general and the auditor general shall, while the proposed charter
28 is being considered for preliminary approval by the council on elementary and secondary education,
29 provide an initial determination to the council on elementary and secondary education, the
30 commissioner, and the speaker of the house of representatives and the president of the senate
31 indicating that the auditor general is satisfied that the nonprofit organization is financially
32 responsible. Final approval for operation of the independent charter school shall not be granted by
33 the council on elementary and secondary education until the auditor general has approved the
34 financial plan and financial-record keeping system and is satisfied that the nonprofit organization
LC001636/SUB A - Page 13 of 18

1 is financially responsible. The auditor general shall notify the council on elementary and secondary
2 education, the commissioner, the president of the senate, and the speaker of the house of
3 representatives of the findings. During the year immediately preceding the September in which the
4 independent charter school is to begin operation, the charter applicant shall make any additional
5 submissions to the auditor general prescribed by the auditor general in the initial determination.
6 Additional submissions during the year prior to the September in which the independent charter
7 school is to begin operation shall include, but not be limited to evidence submitted to the auditor
8 general, not later than June 1st prior to the opening of the independent charter school, of the
9 existence of an agreement, option for lease or purchase, lease agreement, or purchase agreement,
10 contingent upon general assembly funding, for a facility in which the independent charter school
11 will operate in its first year of operation. The auditor general shall have the authority to review
12 independent charter schools affiliated with nonprofit organizations on an annual basis or require
13 the school to have an annual, certified audit in accordance with the same federal and state standards
14 that are applicable to local public school districts. If, as a result of any annual audit, the auditor
15 general believes there are financial irregularities, the auditor general shall withdraw the original
16 approval and the council on elementary and secondary education shall withdraw its approval for
17 the independent charter school to continue operation.
18 SECTION 8. Chapter 16-77.3 of the General Laws entitled "Independent Charter Schools
19 [See Title 16 Chapter 97 — The Rhode Island Board of Education Act]" is hereby amended by
20 adding thereto the following section:

23 invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of this chapter that can be
24 given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of the
25 chapter are severable.
