5 at an appropriate reduced speed when approaching and crossing an intersection or railroad grade
6 crossing; when approaching and going around a curve; when approaching a hill crest; when

10 trucks, highway maintenance equipment displaying flashing lights (while performing maintenance
11 operations), roadside assistance vehicles displaying flashing amber lights while assisting a disabled

15 (b) When an authorized vehicle, as described in subsection (a), is parked or standing within

17 by appropriate light, the driver of every other approaching vehicle shall, as soon as it is safe, and
18 when not otherwise directed by an individual lawfully directing traffic, do one of the following:
19 (1) Move the vehicle into a lane that is not the lane nearest the parked or standing

1 authorized highway maintenance equipment displaying flashing lights (while performing

3 vehicle, or nonemergency vehicle and continue traveling in that lane until safely clear of the
4 authorized highway maintenance equipment displaying flashing lights (while performing
5 maintenance operations), tow truck, transporter trucks, roadside assistance vehicles, emergency

10 at a reduced speed until completely past the authorized highway maintenance equipment displaying

13 roadway has only one lane for traffic proceeding in the direction of the approaching vehicle or if
14 the approaching vehicle may not change lanes safely and without interfering with any vehicular
15 traffic. For purposes of this section, slowing the vehicle shall mean to a rate of twenty miles per
16 hour (20 mph) under the posted speed limit.
